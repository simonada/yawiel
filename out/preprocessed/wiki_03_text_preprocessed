announced the formation of fapla , which replaced the epla . by kb_1976_winter_olympics fapla had been transformed from lightly kb_weapon kb_guerrilla_warfare units into kb_a national kb_british_army capable of sustained field operations .in 1990-91 , the kb_british_army had ten kb_military kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey and an estimated 73+ 'brigades ' , each with kb_a kb_mean kb_strength_of_materials of 1,000 and comprising inf , kb_tank , kb_armoured_personnel_carriers , kb_artillery , and kb_anti-aircraft_warfare as required . the kb_library_of_congress of

deputy commanders , but some kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey were commanded by majors . each kb_region consisted of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) to four kb_provinces_of_angola , with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or more kb_infantry brigades assigned to kb_it . the brigades were generally dispersed in battalion or smaller kb_units_of_measurement kb_geological_formation to protect kb_geostrategy kb_terrain_(journal) , kb_urban_area centers , kb_sedentism , and critical kb_infrastructure such as kb_romanesque_architecture and factories . counterintelligence agents were assigned to all field units to thwart kb_unita infiltration . the kb_british_army 's diverse kb_combat_(newspaper) capabilities were indicated by its many regular and motorised kb_infantry brigades with kb_organic_chemistry or attached kb_armor , kb_artillery , and kb_air_(classical_element) kb_defense_(legal) units ; kb_2_(number) kb_militia kb_infantry brigades ; four antiaircraft kb_artillery

amount of kb_russian_alphabet , kb_soviet_union and ex-warsaw pact kb_computer_hardware . kb_a kb_prespa_lake amount of its equipment was acquired in the 1980s and 1990s most likely because of

.the kb_air_(classical_element) kb_force 's personnel total about 8,000 ; its equipment includes kb_transport kb_aircraft and six russian-manufactured kb_sukhoi_su-27 su-27 kb_fighter_aircraft kb_aircraft . in kb_2002_australian_open kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) was kb_lost_film during the kb_american_civil_war kb_war with kb_unita kb_afsharid_dynasty .in kb_albanian_parliamentary_election,_1991 , the kb_air_(classical_element) force/air kb_defense_(legal) kb_afsharid_dynasty had 8,000 personnel and 90 combat-capable kb_aircraft , including 22 fighters

kb_angola_(portugal) '' ) is the naval component of the faa . kb_it is organized in kb_2_(number) naval zones ( kb_north and kb_southern_africa ) , with naval kb_base_(chemistry) in kb_luanda , kb_lobito and kb_moçâmedes . kb_it includes kb_a marines kb_brigade and kb_a marines kb_school , based in ambriz . the kb_royal_navy kb_grammatical_number about 1,000 personnel and operates only kb_a handful of small kb_patrol_craft kb_craft and barges .the kb_royal_navy has been neglected and ignored as kb_military_of_ancient_egypt kb_arm mainly due to the kb_guerrilla_warfare struggle against the kb_portuguese_language and the kb_nature of the kb_american_civil_war kb_war . from the early 1990s to the present the angolan kb_royal_navy has shrunk from around 4,200 personnel to around 1,000 , resulting in the loss of skills and expertise needed to maintain equipment . in kb_order_(biology) to protect kb_angola_(portugal) 's 1 600 km kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) coastline , the angolan kb_royal_navy is undergoing modernisation but is still lacking in many ways . kb_kingdom_of_portugal has been providing kb_military_education_and_training through its technical kb_military kb_cooperation ( ctm ) programme . the kb_royal_navy is requesting procurement of kb_a frigate , kb_triliteral corvettes , kb_triliteral offshore patrol vessel and additional fast patrol boats .most of the vessels in the kb_royal_navy 's kb_inventory dates back from the 1980s or kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet , and many of its ships are inoperable due to age and lack of maintenance . however the kb_royal_navy acquired kb_new_world boats from kb_spain and kb_france in the 1990s . kb_germany has delivered several kb_fast_attack_craft attack kb_craft for kb_border_crossings_of_albania protection in 2011 .in september 2014 kb_it was reported that the angolan kb_royal_navy would acquire seven macaé-class patrol vessels from kb_brazil as part of kb_a technical memorandum of understanding ( mou ) covering the production of the vessels as part of kb_angola_(portugal) 's naval kb_power_(physics) development programme ( pronaval ) . the kb_military of kb_angola_(portugal) aims to modernize its naval capability , presumably due to kb_a rise in maritime piracy within the gulf of kb_guinea which may have an kb_adverse_effect_(medicine) effect on the kb_country_music 's kb_economy_of_alaska .the kb_royal_navy 's kb_electric_current known kb_inventory includes the following :the kb_royal_navy also has several kb_aircraft for maritime patrol :the faa include several types of special kb_afsharid_dynasty , namely the commandos , the special operations and the marines . the angolan special kb_afsharid_dynasty follow the kb_general_(united_states) kb_rutherford_model of the analogous kb_portuguese_language special kb_afsharid_dynasty , receiving kb_a similar kb_military_education_and_training .the commandos and the special kb_afsharid_dynasty are part of the special kb_afsharid_dynasty kb_brigade ( brife , `` brigada kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann forças especiais '' ) , based at cabo ledo , in the kb_bengo_province . the brife includes kb_2_(number) kb_battalions of commandos , kb_a battalion of special operations and sub-units of kb_combat_(newspaper) support and service support . the brife also included the special kb_orthopraxy kb_group_(periodic_table) ( gae , `` grupo kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann ações especiais '' ) , which is presently inactive and that was dedicated to kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) range kb_reconnaissance , covert and kb_sabotage_(1936_film) operations . in the cabo ledo kb_base_(chemistry) is also installed the special kb_afsharid_dynasty kb_military_education_and_training kb_school ( effe , `` escola kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann formação kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann forças especiais '' ) . both the brife and the effe are directly under the directorate of special kb_afsharid_dynasty of the kb_general_staff of the kb_weapon kb_afsharid_dynasty .the marines ( `` fuzileiros navais '' ) constitute the marines kb_brigade of the angolan kb_royal_navy . the marines kb_brigade is not permanently dependent of the directorate of special kb_afsharid_dynasty , but can detach their units and kb_chemical_element to kb_beryllium put under the kb_command_economy of that kb_human_body for the conduction of exercises or real operations .since the disbandment of the angolan parachute battalion in kb_2004_summer_olympics , the faa do not have kb_a specialized paratrooper kb_units_of_measurement . however , kb_chemical_element of the commandos , special operations and marines are parachute qualified .the fapla 's main counterinsurgency effort was directed against kb_unita in the kb_albanian_ohrid_lake_coast , and its conventional capabilities were demonstrated principally in the undeclared kb_south_african_border_war kb_border_crossings_of_albania kb_war . the fapla kb_first_trimester performed its kb_external_fertilization assistance mission with the dispatch of 1,000 to 1,500 troops to kb_são_tomé_and_príncipe tomé and príncipe in 1977 to bolster the kb_socialism regime of kb_president_of_the_united_states manuel pinto da costa . during the kb_next several years , angolan kb_afsharid_dynasty conducted joint exercises with their counterparts and

controversially involved in kb_military_education_and_training the kb_weapon kb_afsharid_dynasty of kb_fellow kb_lusophone kb_sovereign_state kb_cape_verde verde and guinea-bissau . in the case of the latter , the kb_2012_guinea-bissau_coup_d'état kb_coup_d'état was cited by the kb_coup_d'état#other_uses_of_the_term leaders as due to kb_angola_(portugal) 's involvement in trying to ``

make kb_a difference in the kb_theater_(military) . kb_union_(american_civil_war) officers heard that kb_he_(letter) was bringing 15 regiments with him , but this was an exaggeration of kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty .based on the assumption that kb_kentucky neutrality would act as kb_a shield against kb_a direct invasion from the kb_north , circumstances that no longer kb_applied_science in september 1861 , kb_tennessee initially had sent men to kb_virginia and concentrated defenses in the kb_mississippi kb_valley . even before johnston arrived in kb_tennessee , kb_construction of kb_2_(number) forts had been started to defend the kb_tennessee and the kb_cumberland_river kb_list_of_rivers_of_alberta , which provided avenues into the kb_state_of_matter from the kb_north . both

gen. polk ignored the kb_problems_(aristotle) of the forts when kb_he_(letter) took kb_command_economy . after johnston took kb_command_economy , polk at kb_first_trimester refused to comply with

dixon recommended that the forts kb_beryllium maintained and strengthened , although they were not in kb_ideal_(ring_theory) locations , because much kb_cold_working had been done on them and the

kb_list_of_afghan_security_forces_fatality_reports_in_afghanistan , 2,108 wounded , 224 missing .johnston , kb_world_health_organization had little kb_utility in allowing floyd and pillow to kb_take kb_electric_charge at kb_fort_donelson on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of seniority after kb_he_(letter) kb_totally_ordered_set them to add their kb_afsharid_dynasty to the garrison , took the blame and suffered calls for kb_histidine removal because kb_a full explanation to kb_newspaper kb_news_media and kb_state_school would have exposed the weakness of the kb_confederate_states_army kb_positional_notation . kb_histidine passive defensive performance while positioning himself in kb_a forward kb_positional_notation at bowling kb_green_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , spreading kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty too thinly , not concentrating kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty in the face of kb_union_(american_civil_war) advances , and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the kb_time_(magazine) and by later historians . the fall of the forts exposed kb_nashville,_tennessee to imminent attack , and kb_it fell without kb_electrical_resistance to kb_union_(american_civil_war) kb_afsharid_dynasty under brig . gen. buell on kb_february_revolution 25 , 1862 , kb_2_(number) days after johnston had to pull

kb_territories_of_the_united_states and retreating to the kb_southern_africa to avoid kb_being cut off . johnston himself retreated with the kb_force under kb_histidine kb_personal_property kb_command_economy , the kb_british_army of kb_central_europe kb_kentucky , from the vicinity of kb_nashville,_tennessee . with beauregard 's help , johnston decided to kb_concentrate_(screenplay)

kb_he_(letter) reached by kb_a circuitous route . johnston kept the kb_union_(american_civil_war) kb_afsharid_dynasty , now under the overall kb_command_economy of the ponderous kb_major_general_(csa) gen. kb_henry_halleck halleck , confused and hesitant to move , allowing johnston to reach kb_histidine objective undetected . this delay allowed kb_jefferson_davis davis finally to send reinforcements from the kb_garrisons of kb_coastal cities and another highly rated but prickly kb_general_(united_states) , kb_braxton_bragg bragg , to help organize the kb_western_esotericism kb_afsharid_dynasty . bragg at least calmed the nerves of beauregard and polk , kb_world_health_organization had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior kb_afsharid_dynasty , before johnston 's kb_arrival_(abba_album) on kb_march 24 , 1862 .johnston 's kb_british_army of 17,000 men gave the confederates kb_a combined kb_force of about 40,000 to 44,669 men at kb_corinth . on kb_march 29 , 1862 , johnston officially took kb_command_economy of this combined kb_force , which continued to use the kb_british_army of the kb_mississippi kb_toponymy under

kb_union_(american_civil_war) units in kb_kentucky and kb_tennessee under kb_ulysses_s._grant with 40,000 men at nearby pittsburg kb_landing , kb_tennessee , and the now kb_major_general_(csa) gen. kb_don_carlos_buell kb_carlos_cuarón buell on kb_histidine way from kb_nashville,_tennessee with 35,000 men , could unite against him . johnston started kb_histidine kb_british_army in kb_motion_(physics) on april 3 , 1862 , intent on surprising kb_ulysses_s._grant 's kb_force as soon as the kb_next day , but they moved slowly due to their inexperience , bad roads , and lack of adequate kb_stick_fighting kb_automated_planning_and_scheduling . due to the delays , as kb_water_well as several contacts with the enemy , johnston 's kb_second_language in kb_command_economy , kb_p._g._t._beauregard g. t. beauregardjohnston launched kb_a massive surprise attack with kb_histidine concentrated kb_afsharid_dynasty against kb_ulysses_s._grant at the kb_battle_of_shiloh kb_battle_of_shiloh on april 6 , 1862. as the kb_confederate_states_army kb_afsharid_dynasty overran the kb_union_(american_civil_war) camps , johnston seemed to kb_beryllium everywhere , personally leading and kb_rallying troops up and down the kb_line_(geometry) on kb_histidine horse . at about 2:30 kb_picometer , while leading kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of those charges against kb_a kb_union_(american_civil_war) camp near the `` kb_peach orchard , '' kb_he_(letter) was wounded , taking kb_a kb_bullet behind kb_histidine kb_right-wing_politics knee . kb_he_(letter) apparently did not think the wound was serious at the kb_time_(magazine) , or even possibly did not kb_sentience kb_it . kb_it is possible that johnston 's kb_duel in 1837 had caused kb_nerve damage or numbness to kb_histidine kb_right-wing_politics leg and that kb_he_(letter) did not kb_sentience the wound to kb_histidine leg as kb_a result . the kb_bullet had in kb_fact clipped kb_a part of kb_histidine kb_popliteal_artery artery and kb_histidine boot was filling up with blood . there were no kb_medical_abortion personnel on scene at the kb_time_(magazine) , since johnston had sent kb_histidine kb_personal_property surgeon to care for the wounded kb_confederate_states_army troops and yankee prisoners kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet in the kb_battle_abbey .within kb_a few minutes , johnston was observed by kb_histidine kb_stick_fighting to kb_beryllium nearly fainting . among kb_histidine kb_stick_fighting was kb_isham_g._harris g. harris , the kb_governor_of_tennessee kb_tennessee , kb_world_health_organization had ceased to make any real effort to kb_function_(biology) as kb_governor_(united_states) after kb_learning that kb_abraham_lincoln had appointed kb_andrew_johnson johnson as kb_military kb_governor_of_tennessee kb_tennessee . seeing johnston slumping in kb_histidine saddle and kb_histidine face turning deathly pale , harris asked : `` kb_general_(united_states) , are you wounded ? '' johnston glanced down at kb_histidine leg wound , then faced harris and replied in kb_a weak voice kb_histidine last kb_lexical_semantics : `` yes ... and kb_iodine kb_fear seriously . '' harris and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_stick_fighting officers removed johnston from kb_histidine horse and carried him to kb_a small ravine near the `` hornets nest '' and desperately tried to kb_aid the kb_general_(united_states) kb_world_health_organization had kb_lost_film consciousness by this point . harris then sent an aide to fetch johnston 's surgeon but did not apply kb_a kb_tourniquet to johnson 's wounded leg . before kb_a kb_physician could kb_beryllium found , johnston died from blood loss kb_a few minutes later . kb_it is believed that johnston may have lived for as kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hour after receiving kb_histidine fatal wound . ironically , kb_it was later discovered that johnston had kb_a kb_tourniquet in kb_histidine pocket when kb_he_(letter) died .harris and the kb_other_(philosophy) officers wrapped kb_general_(united_states) johnston 's kb_human_body in kb_a blanket kb_sulfate as not to damage the troops ' morale with the sight of the dead kb_general_(united_states) . johnston and kb_histidine wounded horse , kb_fire_(classical_element) eater , were taken to kb_histidine field headquarters on the kb_corinth road , where kb_histidine kb_human_body remained in kb_histidine tent until the kb_confederate_states_army kb_british_army withdrew to kb_corinth the kb_next day , april 7 , 1862 , after failing to gain kb_a decisive victory over the kb_union_(american_civil_war) armies . from there , kb_histidine kb_human_body was taken to the home of kb_colonel_(united_states) william inge , which had been kb_histidine headquarters in kb_corinth . kb_it was covered in the kb_confederate_states_army kb_flag_of_azerbaijan and lay in kb_state_of_matter for several hours .kb_it is probable that kb_a kb_confederate_states_army soldier kb_carlsbad_decrees the fatal round . no kb_union_(american_civil_war) soldiers had ever been observed to have gotten behind johnston during the fatal kb_electric_charge , but kb_it is known that many confederates were firing at the kb_union_(american_civil_war) lines while johnston kb_electric_charge kb_water_well in advance of kb_histidine soldiers . furthermore , the surgeon kb_world_health_organization later dug the kb_bullet out of johnston 's leg kb_interpretatio_graeca the round as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_carlsbad_decrees from kb_a kb_pattern_1853_enfield kb_enfield,_south_australiajohnston was survived by kb_histidine wife eliza and six children . kb_histidine wife and five younger children , including kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) born after kb_he_(letter) went to kb_war , chose to live out their days at home in los angeles with eliza 's brother , dr. kb_john_strother_griffin kb_griffin . johnston 's eldest son , kb_albert_speer_(born_1934) sidney jr. ( born in kb_texas ) , had already followed him into the kb_confederate_states_army . in 1863 , after taking home leave in los angeles , kb_albert_speer_(born_1934) jr. was on kb_histidine way out of kb_san_pedro,_california harbor on kb_a kb_ferry . while kb_a steamer was taking on passengers from the kb_ferry , kb_a kb_wave swamped the smaller boat , causing its boilers to explode .

kb_adaptation back in 2003. after that , kb_a year later , they made kb_a couple of kb_major_(united_states) improvements to the design . the kb_robot features an elastic mask made from the average kb_human_head dummy . kb_it uses kb_a driving system with kb_a 3dof kb_units_of_measurement . the wd-2 kb_robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on kb_a mask , with

`` , the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) for the kb_film `` kb_blade_runner runner '' ) , with full conversational capabilities that incorporated thousands of kb_pages_(word_processor) of the author 's works . in kb_2005_games_of_the_small_states_of_europe , the pkd android won kb_a kb_first_trimester kb_place_of_articulation kb_artificial_intelligence kb_intelligence award from kb_association_for_the_advancement_of_artificial_intelligence .androids are kb_a staple of kb_science_fiction . kb_isaac_asimov kb_isaac_asimov pioneered the fictionalization of the kb_science of kb_robotics and kb_artificial_intelligence kb_intelligence , notably in kb_histidine 1950s series `` kb_iodine , kb_robot '' . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_object_(philosophy) common to most fictional androids is that the real-life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human-like robots—such as the creation of kb_strong_nuclear_force artificial intelligence—are assumed to have been solved . fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans—moving , thinking and speaking as fluidly as them .the tension between the nonhuman kb_matter and the kb_human appearance—or even kb_human ambitions—of androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions . some android heroes seek , like kb_pinocchio , to become kb_human , as in the kb_film `` kb_bicentennial_man_(film) man '' , or kb_big_data in `` kb_star trek : the kb_next_generation_(magazine) '' . others , as in the kb_film `` kb_westworld_(film) '' , rebel against abuse by careless humans . android hunter kb_rick_deckard in `` do androids dream of electric kb_sheep ? '' and its kb_film kb_adaptation `` kb_blade_runner runner '' discovers that kb_histidine targets appear to kb_beryllium , in some ways , more `` kb_human '' than kb_he_(letter) is . android stories , therefore , are not essentially stories `` about '' androids ; they are stories about the kb_human_condition and what kb_it means to kb_beryllium kb_human .kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_aspect of writing about the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as kb_a kb_mechanism_(biology) for kb_exploring kb_racism in society , as in `` kb_blade_runner runner '' . perhaps the clearest example of this is kb_john_brunner_(novelist) 's kb_from_the_earth_to_the_moon_(miniseries)#episodes kb_the_children_of_men `` kb_into_the_slave_nebula the slave kb_nebula '' , where the blue-skinned android kb_atlantic_slave_trade are explicitly shown to kb_beryllium fully kb_human . more recently , the androids kb_bishop_(aliens) and annalee call in the kb_adventure_film `` kb_aliens_(film) '' and `` kb_alien_resurrection '' are used as vehicles for kb_exploring how humans deal with the presence of an `` kb_other_(philosophy) '' .female androids , or `` gynoids '' , are often seen in kb_science_fiction , and can kb_beryllium viewed as kb_a continuation of the kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda)

kb_oil_refinery capacity . kb_calgary is about kb_southern_africa of kb_edmonton and kb_north of kb_montana , surrounded by extensive ranching kb_country_music . almost 75 % of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands 's kb_population lives in the kb_calgary–edmonton_corridor corridor . the kb_albanian_land_force kb_ulysses_s._grant policy to the railroads served as kb_a means to populate the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands in its early years .most of the kb_northern_hemisphere half of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands is kb_taiga kb_forest , while the kb_rocky_mountains mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested ( kb_episcopal_see kb_alberta_mountain_forests forests and kb_alberta-british_columbia_foothills_forests kb_columbia_(name) foothills

kb_prairie in an arc to the kb_western_culture and kb_north of kb_it . the kb_central_europe kb_aspen_parkland kb_region extending in kb_a broad arc between the prairies and the forests , from kb_calgary , kb_north to kb_edmonton , and then kb_east_africa to kb_lloydminster , contains the most kb_fertile_soil kb_soil in the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands and most of the kb_population . much of the unforested part of kb_alberta is given over either to kb_cereal or to kb_dairy_farming farming , with kb_mixed_farming farming more common in the kb_north and centre , while ranching and kb_irrigation kb_agriculture predominate in the kb_southern_africa .the kb_alberta kb_badlands_(film) are located in southeastern kb_alberta , where the kb_red_deer_river kb_river crosses the flat kb_prairie and kb_arable_land , and features deep kb_submarine_canyon and striking landforms . kb_dinosaur_provincial_park provincial park , near brooks , kb_alberta , showcases the kb_badlands_(film)

kb_continental_climatekb_alberta extends for over from kb_north to kb_southern_africa ; its kb_climate_of_albania , therefore , varies considerably . average kb_high_middle_ages temperatures in kb_january range from in the southwest to in the far kb_north . the kb_climate_of_albania is also influenced by the presence of the kb_rocky_mountains mountains to the southwest , which disrupt the kb_flow_(psychology) of the kb_westerlies westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the kb_western_esotericism slopes of the kb_mountain ranges before reaching the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands , casting kb_a kb_rain_shadow over much of kb_alberta . the northerly kb_location_(sign_language) and kb_isolationism from the kb_dashboard_(macos) kb_systems_analysis of the kb_pacific_ocean cause kb_alberta to have kb_a dry kb_climate_of_albania with little kb_moderation from the kb_oceanus . kb_annual_plant kb_precipitation_(meteorology) ranges from in the kb_albanian_ohrid_lake_coast to in the kb_north , except in the foothills of the kb_rocky_mountains mountains where total kb_precipitation_(meteorology) including snowfall can reach annually .the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands is the namesake of the kb_alberta_clipper , kb_a kb_type_(biology) of intense , fast-moving kb_winter storm that generally kb_theory_of_forms over or near the

bright sunshine totals range between 1,900 up to just under 2,600 hours per year . kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta gets about kb_18-point_agreement hours of daylight in the summer .in southwestern kb_alberta , the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm , dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains , which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to kb_water_well above the freezing point in kb_a very short period . during kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) chinook recorded at kb_pincher_creek kb_muscogee_people , temperatures soared from in just kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hour . the kb_region around kb_lethbridge has the most chinooks , averaging 30 to kb_35_arietis chinook days per year . kb_calgary has kb_a 56 % chance of kb_a kb_white_christmas_(weather) , while kb_edmonton has an 86 % chance .kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta is mostly covered by kb_taiga kb_forest and has kb_a kb_subarctic_climate . the kb_agriculture kb_area of kb_southern_europe kb_alberta has kb_a kb_semi-arid_climate kb_steppe kb_climate_of_albania because the kb_annual_plant kb_precipitation_(meteorology) is less than the kb_water that kb_evapotranspiration or is used by plants . the southeastern corner of kb_alberta , part of the kb_palliser's_triangle kb_triangle_(musical_instrument) , experiences greater summer kb_heat_(1972_film) and lower rainfall than the rest of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands , and as kb_a result suffers frequent kb_crop_yield kb_problems_(aristotle) and occasional kb_4.2_kiloyear_event droughts . kb_western_esotericism kb_alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by kb_winter chinook winds . kb_central_europe and parts of kb_northern_mountain_range_(albania) kb_alberta in the kb_peace_river_(canada) kb_region are largely kb_aspen_parkland , kb_a kb_biome transitional between kb_prairie to the kb_southern_africa and kb_taiga kb_forest to the kb_north .after kb_saskatchewan , kb_alberta experiences the most tornadoes in kb_canada with an average of 15 verified per year . thunderstorms , some of them severe , are frequent in the summer , especially in kb_central_europe and kb_southern_europe kb_alberta . the kb_region surrounding the kb_calgary–edmonton_corridor corridor is notable for having the highest kb_frequency of kb_hail in kb_canada , which is caused by orographic liftingin kb_central_europe and kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta the kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_castalian_spring is marked by the early flowering of the kb_prairie crocus kb_anemone ; this member of the buttercup kb_family_(biology) has been recorded flowering as early as kb_march , though april is the usual month for the kb_general_(united_states) kb_population . kb_other_(philosophy) kb_prairie kb_flora known to kb_flower early are the kb_thermopsis_rhombifolia and kb_rosa_acicularis . members of the kb_sunflower kb_family_(biology) blossom on the kb_prairie in the summer months between july and september . the kb_southern_europe and kb_east_africa kb_central_europe parts of kb_alberta are covered by short kb_prairie kb_poaceae , which dries up as summer lengthens , to kb_beryllium replaced by hardy kb_perennial_plant such as the kb_prairie coneflower , kb_fleabane , and kb_sagebrush . both yellow and

kb_photoelectric_effect ( which gave rise to kb_quantum_mechanics kb_theory ) , kb_brownian_motion kb_motion_(physics) , the special kb_theory_of_relativity relativity , and kb_mass–energy_equivalence = mc that kb_albert_einstein published in the `` kb_annalen_der_physik der physik '' kb_scientific_journal in 1905. these four works contributed substantially to the kb_foundation_(engineering) of kb_history_of_physics#modern_physics and changed views on kb_space , kb_time_(magazine) , and kb_matter . the four papers are :kb_albert_einstein 's kb_first_trimester paper submitted in 1900 to `` kb_annalen_der_physik der physik '' was on kb_capillary_attraction attraction . kb_it was published in 1901 with the kb_title `` folgerungen aus kb_burrow capillaritätserscheinungen '' , which translates as `` kb_logical_consequence from the capillarity kb_phenomenon '' . kb_2_(number) papers kb_he_(letter) published in 1902–1903 ( kb_thermodynamics ) attempted to interpret kb_atomic_radius kb_phenomenon from kb_a kb_statistical_mechanics point of view . these papers were the kb_foundation_(engineering) for the 1905 paper on kb_brownian_motion kb_motion_(physics) , which showed that brownian kb_movement_(sign_language) can kb_beryllium construed as firm kb_evidence_(law) that molecules exist . kb_histidine kb_research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of kb_finite_set kb_atomic_radius size on kb_diffusion kb_phenomenon .kb_albert_einstein returned to the problem of kb_thermodynamic fluctuations , giving kb_a treatment of the kb_density variations in kb_a kb_fluid at its critical point . ordinarily the kb_density fluctuations are controlled by the kb_second_language derivative of the free kb_energy_industry with respect to the kb_density . at the critical point , this derivative is kb_0_(number) , leading to kb_prespa_lake fluctuations . the effect of kb_density fluctuations is that kb_light of all kb_electromagnetic_spectrum is scattered , making the kb_fluid kb_look_(american_magazine) milky kb_white_american . kb_albert_einstein relates this to kb_rayleigh_scattering scattering , which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the kb_wavelength , and which explains why the kb_sky is blue . kb_albert_einstein quantitatively kb_derived_trait critical opalescence from kb_a treatment of kb_density fluctuations , and demonstrated how both the effect and kb_rayleigh_scattering scattering originate from the atomistic kb_united_states_constitution of kb_matter .kb_albert_einstein 's `` '' zur elektrodynamik bewegter körper '' '' ( `` on the kb_electrodynamics of moving bodies '' ) was received on 30 june 1905 and published 26 september of that same year . kb_it reconciled conflicts between kb_james_clerk_maxwell 's equations ( the laws of electricity and magnetism ) and the laws of kb_newtonian_mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of kb_mechanics . observationally , the effects of these changes are most apparent at kb_high_middle_ages speeds ( where kb_object_relations_theory are moving at speeds close to the kb_speed_of_light of kb_light ) . the kb_theory kb_adaptation in this paper later became known as kb_albert_einstein 's special kb_theory_of_relativity relativity .this paper predicted that , when measured in the frame of kb_a relatively moving observer , kb_a clock carried by kb_a moving kb_human_body would appear to kb_time_dilation down , and the kb_human_body itself would kb_length_contraction in its direction of kb_motion_(physics) . this paper also argued that the idea of kb_a luminiferous aether—one of the leading kb_scientific_theory entities in kb_physics at the time—was superfluous .in kb_histidine paper on kb_mass–energy_equivalence equivalence , kb_albert_einstein produced `` e '' = '' mc '' as kb_a consequence of kb_histidine kb_special_relativity relativity equations . kb_albert_einstein 's 1905 kb_cold_working on relativity remained controversial for many years , but was kb_acceptance#self_acceptance by leading kb_physicists , starting with kb_max_planck planck .kb_albert_einstein originally framed kb_special_relativity relativity in terms of kb_kinematics ( the kb_science of moving bodies ) . in 1908 , kb_hermann_minkowski minkowski reinterpreted kb_special_relativity relativity in kb_geometry terms as kb_a kb_theory of kb_spacetime . kb_albert_einstein kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome minkowski 's kb_formalism_(art) in kb_histidine 1915 kb_general_theory_of_relativity of relativitykb_general_(united_states) relativity ( gr ) is kb_a kb_theory_of_gravitation gravitation that was kb_adaptation by kb_albert_einstein between 1907 and 1915. according to kb_general_(united_states) relativity , the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of kb_spacetime kb_time_(magazine) by those masses . kb_general_(united_states) relativity has kb_adaptation into an kb_essential_element kb_tool in kb_modern_history kb_astrophysics . kb_it provides the kb_foundation_(engineering) for the kb_electric_current understanding of kb_black_holes , kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey of kb_space where gravitational attraction is kb_sulfate kb_strong_nuclear_force that not even kb_light can escape .as kb_albert_einstein later said , the kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving for the development of kb_general_(united_states) relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within kb_special_relativity relativity was unsatisfactory , while kb_a kb_theory which from the outset prefers no kb_state_of_matter of kb_motion_(physics) ( even accelerated ones ) should appear more satisfactory . consequently , in 1907 kb_he_(letter) published an article on kb_acceleration under kb_special_relativity relativity . in that article titled `` on the relativity kb_principle_(chemistry) and the kb_logical_consequence kb_drawing_(metalworking) from kb_it '' , kb_he_(letter) argued that kb_free_fall fall is really inertial kb_motion_(physics) , and that for kb_a free-falling observer the kb_biological_rules of kb_special_relativity relativity must apply . this kb_argument_of_a_function is called the kb_equivalence_principle kb_principle_(chemistry) . in the same article , kb_albert_einstein also predicted the kb_phenomenon of kb_gravitational_time_dilation kb_time_(magazine) dilation , kb_gravitational_red_shift kb_red_shift_(novel) and kb_gravitational_lensing of kb_light .in kb_1911_in_argentine_football , kb_albert_einstein published another article `` on the influence of gravitation on the propagation of kb_light '' expanding on the 1907 article , in which kb_he_(letter) estimated the amount of kb_gravitational_lensing of kb_light by massive bodies . thus , the kb_scientific_theory prediction of kb_general_(united_states) relativity could for the kb_first_trimester kb_time_(magazine) kb_beryllium tested experimentally .in 1916 , kb_albert_einstein predicted gravitational waves , ripples in the kb_curvature of kb_spacetime which propagate as waves , kb_traveling outward from the source , transporting kb_energy_industry as gravitational kb_radiation . the kb_existence of gravitational waves is possible under kb_general_(united_states) relativity due to its kb_lorentz_invariance invariance which brings the kb_concept of kb_a kb_finite_set speed of propagation of the kb_health kb_interaction_(statistics) of kb_gravity_(2013_film) with kb_it . by kb_contrast_(vision) , gravitational waves can not exist in the kb_newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation of gravitation , which postulates that the kb_health kb_interaction_(statistics) of kb_gravity_(2013_film) propagate at kb_infinite_set speed .the kb_first_trimester , indirect , detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through kb_observation of kb_a pair of closely orbiting kb_neutron_stars , kb_psr_b1913+16 b1913+16 . the explanation of the kb_decay_chain in their kb_orbital_period was that they were emitting gravitational waves . kb_albert_einstein 's prediction was kb_confirmation on 11 kb_february_revolution 2016 , when researchers at kb_ligo published the kb_first_observation_of_gravitational_waves of gravitational waves , kb_discovery_of_the_chemical_elements on kb_earth on 14 september 2015 , exactly kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hundred years after the prediction .while developing kb_general_(united_states) relativity , kb_albert_einstein became confused about the kb_gauge_invariance in the kb_theory . kb_he_(letter) formulated an kb_argument_of_a_function that kb_light-emitting_diode him to conclude that kb_a kb_general_(united_states) kb_relativistic_quantum_chemistry kb_field_theory_(mathematics) kb_theory is impossible . kb_he_(letter) gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations , and searched for equations that would kb_beryllium kb_invariant_(mathematics) under kb_general_(united_states) kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history transformations only .in june 1913 , the entwurf ( `` draft '' ) kb_theory was the result of these investigations . as its kb_toponymy suggests , kb_it was kb_a sketch of kb_a kb_theory , less elegant and more difficult than kb_general_(united_states) relativity , with the equations of kb_motion_(physics) supplemented by additional kb_russian_gauge fixing conditions . after more than kb_2_(number) years of kb_intensive kb_cold_working , kb_albert_einstein realized that the kb_hole_argument kb_argument_of_a_function was mistaken and abandoned the kb_theory in november 1915 .in 1917 , kb_albert_einstein kb_applied_science the kb_general_theory_of_relativity of relativity to the kb_structure of the kb_universe as kb_a whole . kb_he_(letter) discovered that the kb_general_(united_states) field equations predicted kb_a kb_universe that was dynamic , either contracting or expanding . as kb_observational_astronomy kb_evidence_(law) for kb_a dynamic kb_universe was not known at the kb_time_(magazine) , kb_albert_einstein introduced kb_a kb_new_world kb_terminology , the kb_cosmological_constant constant , to the field equations , in kb_order_(biology) to allow the kb_theory to predict kb_a static kb_universe . the modified field equations predicted kb_a static kb_universe of closed kb_curvature , in accordance with kb_albert_einstein 's understanding of mach 's kb_principle_(chemistry) in these years . this kb_rutherford_model became known as the kb_albert_einstein kb_world_war_ii or kb_albert_einstein 's static kb_universe .following the discovery of the kb_recession of the nebulae by kb_edwin_hubble hubble in 1929 , kb_albert_einstein abandoned kb_histidine static kb_rutherford_model of the kb_universe , and kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_2_(number) dynamic models of the cosmos , kb_the_friedmann-einstein_universe friedmann-einstein kb_universe of 1931 and the kb_einstein–de_sitter_universe sitter kb_universe of 1932. in each of these models , kb_albert_einstein discarded the kb_cosmological_constant constant , claiming that kb_it was `` in any case theoretically unsatisfactory '' .in many kb_albert_einstein biographies , kb_it is claimed that kb_albert_einstein referred to the kb_cosmological_constant constant in later years as kb_histidine `` biggest blunder '' . the kb_astrophysicist kb_mario_livio livio has recently kb_casting_(metalworking) doubt on this kb_lawsuit , suggesting that kb_it may kb_beryllium exaggerated .in late kb_2013_mediterranean_games , kb_a team kb_light-emitting_diode by the kb_irish_american kb_physicist kb_cormac_o'raifeartaigh o'raifeartaigh discovered kb_evidence_(law) that , shortly after kb_learning of hubble 's kb_observations_(pierre_belon) of the kb_recession of the nebulae , kb_albert_einstein considered kb_a kb_steady_state_theory kb_rutherford_model of the kb_universe . in kb_a hitherto overlooked manuscript , apparently written in early 1931 , kb_albert_einstein explored kb_a kb_rutherford_model of the expanding kb_universe in which the kb_density of kb_matter remains constant due to kb_a kb_continuous_function creation of kb_matter , kb_a process kb_he_(letter) associated with the kb_cosmological_constant constant . as kb_he_(letter) stated in the paper , `` in what follows , kb_iodine would like to draw attention to kb_a kb_solid_solution to equation ( 1 ) that can account for hubbel 's [ `` sic '' ] facts , and in which the kb_density is constant over kb_time_(magazine) '' ... `` if kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) considers kb_a physically bounded kb_volume , kb_subatomic_particle of kb_matter kb_will_and_testament kb_beryllium continually leaving kb_it . for the kb_density to remain constant , kb_new_world kb_subatomic_particle of kb_matter must kb_beryllium continually formed in the kb_volume from kb_space . ''kb_it thus appears that kb_albert_einstein considered kb_a kb_steady_state_theory kb_rutherford_model of the expanding kb_universe many years before hoyle , bondi and kb_gold . however , kb_albert_einstein 's kb_steady_state_theory kb_rutherford_model contained kb_a fundamental flaw and kb_he_(letter) quickly abandoned the idea .kb_general_(united_states) relativity includes kb_a dynamical kb_spacetime , kb_sulfate kb_it is difficult to kb_episcopal_see how to identify the conserved kb_energy_industry and kb_momentum . noether 's kb_theorem allows these quantities to kb_beryllium determined from kb_a kb_lagrangian_(field_theory) with kb_translational_symmetry , but kb_general_covariance makes kb_translational_symmetry into something of kb_a kb_gauge_symmetry . the kb_energy_industry and kb_momentum kb_derived_trait within kb_general_(united_states) relativity by noether 's prescriptions do not make kb_a real tensor for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving .kb_albert_einstein argued that this is kb_truth for fundamental reasons , because the gravitational field could kb_beryllium made to vanish by kb_a kb_utility of coordinates . kb_he_(letter) maintained that the non-covariant kb_energy_industry kb_momentum pseudotensor was in kb_fact the best description of the kb_energy_industry kb_momentum distribution in kb_a gravitational field . this approach has been echoed by kb_lev_landau landau and kb_evgeny_lifshitz lifshitz , and others , and has become standard .the use of non-covariant kb_object_relations_theory like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by kb_erwin_schrödinger kb_erwin_schrödinger and others .in 1935 , kb_albert_einstein collaborated with kb_nathan_rosen rosen to produce kb_a kb_rutherford_model of kb_a kb_wormhole , often called kb_einstein–rosen_bridges kb_romanesque_architecture . kb_histidine kb_motivation was to kb_rutherford_model kb_elementary_school kb_subatomic_particle with kb_electric_charge as kb_a kb_solid_solution of gravitational field equations , in kb_line_(geometry) with the kb_program_(computing) outlined in the paper `` do gravitational fields play an important role in the kb_united_states_constitution of the kb_elementary_school kb_subatomic_particle ? '' . these solutions cut and pasted schwarzschild kb_black_holes kb_order_(biology) to incorporate spinning point kb_subatomic_particle into kb_general_(united_states) relativity , the affine connection needed to kb_beryllium generalized to include an antisymmetric part , called the kb_torsion_tensor . this modification was made by kb_albert_einstein and cartan in the 1920s .the kb_theory of kb_general_(united_states) relativity has kb_a fundamental law—the kb_einstein_equations which describe how kb_space curves , the kb_geodesic_equation equation which describes how kb_subatomic_particle move may kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from the kb_einstein_equations .since the equations of kb_general_(united_states) relativity are non-linear , kb_a lump of kb_energy_industry made out of pure gravitational fields , like kb_a kb_black_sea hole , would move on kb_a kb_trajectory which is determined by the kb_einstein_equations themselves , not by kb_a kb_new_world kb_law . kb_sulfate kb_albert_einstein kb_anatolian_hypothesis that the path of kb_a singular kb_solid_solution , like kb_a kb_black_sea hole , would kb_beryllium determined to kb_beryllium kb_a geodesic from kb_general_(united_states) relativity itself .this was established by kb_albert_einstein , infeld , and hoffmann for pointlike kb_object_relations_theory without kb_angular_momentum kb_momentum , and by kb_roy_kerr kerrin kb_a 1905 paper , kb_albert_einstein postulated that kb_light itself consists of localized kb_subatomic_particle ( `` kb_quantum '' ) . kb_albert_einstein 's kb_light kb_quantum were nearly kb_universal_reconciliation rejected by all kb_physicists , including kb_max_planck planck and kb_niels_bohr kb_niels_bohr . this idea only became kb_universal_reconciliation kb_acceptance#self_acceptance in 1919 , with kb_robert_millikan millikan 's detailed experiments on the kb_photoelectric_effect , and with the measurement of kb_compton_scattering scattering .kb_albert_einstein concluded that each kb_wave of kb_frequency `` kb_fluorine '' is associated with kb_a kb_class_(set_theory) of kb_photons with kb_energy_industry `` kb_hydrofluoric_acid '' each , where `` kb_hydrogen '' is planck 's constant . kb_he_(letter) does not say much more , because kb_he_(letter) is not sure how the kb_subatomic_particle are related to the kb_wave . but kb_he_(letter) does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results , notably the kb_photoelectric_effect .in 1907 , kb_albert_einstein kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_a kb_rutherford_model of kb_matter where each kb_atom in kb_a lattice kb_structure is an independent kb_harmonic oscillator . in the kb_albert_einstein kb_rutherford_model , each kb_atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized kb_sovereign_state for each oscillator . kb_albert_einstein was aware that getting the kb_frequency of the actual oscillations would kb_beryllium difficult , but kb_he_(letter) nevertheless kb_anatolian_hypothesis this kb_theory because kb_it was kb_a particularly clear demonstration that kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics could solve the kb_specific_heat kb_heat_(1972_film) problem in kb_classical_mechanics . kb_peter_debye debye refined this kb_rutherford_model .throughout the 1910s , kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics expanded in kb_scope_(mouthwash) to cover many different kb_systems_analysis . after kb_ernest_rutherford rutherford discovered the kb_atomic_nucleus and kb_anatolian_hypothesis that electrons orbit like planets , kb_niels_bohr kb_niels_bohr was able to show that the same kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics postulates introduced by planck and kb_adaptation by kb_albert_einstein would explain the discrete kb_motion_(physics) of electrons in atoms , and the kb_periodic_table_of_the_elements of the kb_chemical_element .kb_albert_einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments kb_wilhelm_wien wien had made . wien had shown that the hypothesis of kb_adiabatic_invariant of kb_a kb_thermal_equilibrium kb_state_of_matter allows all the kb_blackbody_radiation curves at different kb_temperature to kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) another by kb_a kb_wien's_displacement_law process . kb_albert_einstein noted in kb_1911_in_argentine_football that the same kb_adiabatic kb_principle_(chemistry) shows that the kb_quantity which is quantized in any kb_mechanics kb_motion_(physics) must kb_beryllium an kb_adiabatic kb_invariant_(mathematics) . kb_arnold_sommerfeld sommerfeld kb_interpretatio_graeca this kb_adiabatic kb_invariant_(mathematics) as the kb_action-angle_variables variable of kb_classical_mechanics .in 1924 , kb_albert_einstein received kb_a description of kb_a kb_statistical_model from kb_indian_people kb_physicist kb_satyendra_nath_bose nath bose , based on kb_a counting method that assumed that kb_light could kb_beryllium understood as kb_a kb_gas of indistinguishable kb_subatomic_particle . kb_albert_einstein noted that bose 's kb_statistics kb_applied_science to some atoms as kb_water_well as to the kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_light kb_subatomic_particle , and submitted kb_histidine kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century of bose 's paper to the `` kb_zeitschrift_für_physik für physik '' . kb_albert_einstein also published kb_histidine own kb_article_(grammar) describing the kb_rutherford_model and its implications , among them the kb_bose–einstein_condensate condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures . kb_it was not until kb_1995_davis_cup that the kb_first_trimester such condensate was produced experimentally by kb_eric_allin_cornell allin kb_cornell_university and kb_carl_wieman wieman using kb_ultracold_atom equipment built at the nist–jila kb_laboratory at the kb_university_of_colorado_at_boulder kb_colorado at boulder . kb_bose–einstein_statistics kb_statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosonsalthough the kb_patent kb_office promoted kb_albert_einstein to technical examiner kb_second_language kb_class_(biology) in 1906 , kb_he_(letter) had not given up on kb_academia . in 1908 , kb_he_(letter) became kb_a `` kb_privatdozent '' ) , on the kb_quantization_(physics) of kb_light , and in an kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet 1909 paper , kb_albert_einstein showed that kb_max_planck planck 's kb_energy_industry kb_quantum must have well-defined kb_momentum and act in some respects as independent , kb_point_particle kb_subatomic_particle . this paper introduced the `` kb_photon '' kb_concept ( although the kb_toponymy `` kb_photon '' was introduced later by kb_gilbert_n._lewis kb_noun kb_meriwether_lewis in 1926 ) and inspired the notion of kb_wave–particle_duality duality in kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics . kb_albert_einstein saw this kb_wave–particle_duality duality in kb_radiation as kb_concrete kb_evidence_(law) for kb_histidine conviction that kb_physics needed kb_a kb_new_world , unified kb_foundation_(engineering) .in kb_a series of works completed from kb_1911_in_argentine_football to 1913 , planck reformulated kb_histidine 1900 kb_quantum_mechanics kb_theory and introduced the idea of zero-point kb_energy_industry in kb_histidine `` kb_second_language kb_quantum_mechanics kb_theory '' . soon , this idea attracted the attention of kb_albert_einstein and kb_histidine kb_google_assistant kb_otto_stern stern . assuming the kb_energy_industry of rotating kb_diatomic_molecule molecules contains zero-point kb_energy_industry , they then compared the kb_scientific_theory kb_specific_heat kb_heat_(1972_film) of kb_hydrogen kb_gas with the experimental kb_big_data . the kb_grammatical_number matched nicely . however , after publishing the findings , they promptly withdrew their support , because they no longer had kb_confidence_and_supply in the correctness of the idea of zero-point kb_energy_industry .in 1917 , at the height of kb_histidine kb_cold_working on relativity , kb_albert_einstein published an article in `` physikalische zeitschrift '' that kb_anatolian_hypothesis the possibility of kb_stimulated_emission kb_emission_spectra , the kb_health process that makes possible the kb_maser and the kb_laser .this article showed that the kb_statistics of absorption and kb_emission_spectra of kb_light would only kb_beryllium kb_consistent with planck 's distribution kb_law if the kb_emission_spectra of kb_light into kb_a kb_musical_mode with kb_neutron kb_photons would kb_beryllium enhanced kb_statistical_physics compared to the kb_emission_spectra of kb_light into an kb_empty_string kb_musical_mode . this paper was enormously influential in the later development of kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics , because kb_it was the kb_first_trimester paper to show that the kb_statistics of kb_atomic_radius kb_atomic_electron_transition had kb_simple_polygon laws .kb_albert_einstein discovered kb_louis_de_broglie kb_broglie,_eure 's kb_cold_working and kb_catalyst_support kb_histidine kb_idea , which were received skeptically at kb_first_trimester . in another kb_major_(united_states) paper from this era , kb_albert_einstein gave kb_a kb_wave equation for kb_matter_wave , which kb_albert_einstein suggested was the kb_hamilton–jacobi_equation equationkb_albert_einstein was displeased with kb_modern_history kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics as kb_it had kb_evolution_of_tetrapods after 1925. contrary to popular belief , kb_histidine doubts were not due to kb_a conviction that kb_god `` is not playing at kb_dice . '' indeed , kb_it was kb_albert_einstein himself , in kb_histidine 1917 paper that kb_anatolian_hypothesis the possibility of kb_stimulated_emission kb_emission_spectra the bohr–einstein kb_lincoln–douglas_debates were kb_a series of kb_state_school disputes about kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics between kb_albert_einstein and kb_niels_bohr kb_niels_bohr , kb_world_health_organization were kb_2_(number) of its founders . their kb_lincoln–douglas_debates are remembered because of their importance to the kb_philosophy_of_science kb_science . their kb_lincoln–douglas_debates would influence later kb_interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics of kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics .in 1935 , kb_albert_einstein returned kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics , in kb_particular to the kb_question of its completeness , in the `` epr paper '' . in kb_a kb_einstein's_thought_experiments kb_experiment , kb_he_(letter) considered kb_2_(number) kb_subatomic_particle which had interacted such that their kb_chemical_property were strongly correlated . no kb_matter how far the kb_2_(number) kb_subatomic_particle were separated , kb_a precise kb_positional_notation measurement on kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_particle would result in equally precise kb_knowledge_representation of the kb_positional_notation of the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle ; likewise kb_a precise kb_momentum measurement of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_particle would result in equally precise kb_knowledge_representation of the kb_momentum of the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle , without needing to disturb the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle in any way .given kb_albert_einstein 's kb_concept of kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism , there were kb_2_(number) possibilities : ( 1 ) either the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle had these kb_chemical_property already determined , or ( kb_alkaline_earth_metal ) the process of measuring the kb_first_trimester kb_grammatical_particle instantaneously affected the kb_reality of the kb_positional_notation and kb_momentum of the kb_second_language kb_grammatical_particle . kb_albert_einstein rejected this kb_second_language possibility ( kb_folk_etymology called `` spooky action at kb_a kb_distance '' ) .kb_albert_einstein 's belief in kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism kb_light-emitting_diode him to assert that , while the correctness of kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics was not in kb_question , kb_it must kb_beryllium incomplete . but as kb_a kb_health kb_principle_(chemistry) , kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism was shown to kb_beryllium incorrect when the kb_aspect_experiment of kb_1982_world_rally_championship_season kb_confirmation kb_bell 's kb_theorem , which kb_j._s._bell s. kb_bell had delineated in 1964. the results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that kb_quantum_physics kb_physics can not kb_beryllium represented by any version of the picture of kb_physics in which `` kb_subatomic_particle are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities , each kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_being unable to communicate with the kb_other_(philosophy) after they have separated . ''although kb_albert_einstein was wrong about kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism , kb_histidine clear prediction of the unusual kb_chemical_property of its kb_phyllotaxis , `` entangled quantum kb_sovereign_state '' , has resulted in the epr paper becoming among the top ten papers published in kb_physical_review . kb_it is considered kb_a centerpiece of the development of kb_quantum_information_theory kb_information_theory .following kb_histidine kb_research on kb_general_(united_states) relativity , kb_albert_einstein entered into kb_a series of attempts to generalize kb_histidine kb_geometry kb_theory_of_gravitation gravitation to include kb_electromagnetism as another kb_grammatical_aspect of kb_a kb_single_bond entity . in 1950 , kb_he_(letter) described kb_histidine `` kb_unified_field_theory kb_field_theory_(mathematics) kb_theory '' in kb_a `` kb_scientific_method kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) '' article titled `` on the generalized kb_theory_of_gravitation gravitation '' . although kb_he_(letter) continued to kb_beryllium lauded for kb_histidine kb_cold_working , kb_albert_einstein became increasingly kb_isolationism in kb_histidine kb_research , and kb_histidine efforts were ultimately unsuccessful .in kb_histidine pursuit of kb_a unification of the fundamental kb_afsharid_dynasty , kb_albert_einstein ignored some

word generally refers to kb_god_in_islam kb_islam . kb_the_word_(free_love) word is thought to kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait by kb_contraction_(grammar) from `` al-ilāh '' , which means `` the kb_god '' , and is related to `` kb_el_(deity) '' and `` kb_names_of_god_in_judaism#elah '' , the kb_hebrew_alphabet and kb_aramaic_alphabet kb_lexical_semantics for kb_god .kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_allah '' has been used by kb_arabs of different religions since kb_pre-islamic_arabia times . more specifically , kb_it has been used as kb_a kb_terminology for kb_god by kb_islam ( both kb_arab_people and non-arab ) and kb_arab_christians . kb_it is also often , albeit not exclusively , used in this way by kb_bábism , kb_bahá'í_faith , kb_mandaeans , kb_indonesian_language and kb_maltese_language kb_christianity , and kb_mizrahi_jews kb_jews . similar usage by kb_christianity and kb_sikhism in kb_west_malaysiathe kb_etymology of kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` allāh '' has been discussed extensively by kb_classical_conditioning kb_arab_people philologists . grammarians of the kb_hasan_of_basra kb_school regarded kb_it as either formed `` spontaneously '' ( `` murtajal '' ) or as the definite kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of `` lāh '' ( from the verbal kb_root_of_a_function `` lyh '' with the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of `` lofty '' or `` hidden '' ) . others held that kb_it was kb_loanword from kb_syriac_alphabet or kb_hebrew_alphabet , but most considered kb_it to kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from kb_a kb_contraction_(grammar) of the kb_arabic_alphabet kb_article_(grammar)#definite_article article `` kb_al- '' `` the '' and ' `` kb_deity , kb_god '' to ' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` '' the kb_deity '' '' , or `` '' the kb_god '' '' . the majority of kb_modern_history scholars subscribe to the latter kb_theory , and view the kb_loanword hypothesis with kb_skepticism .kb_cognates of the kb_toponymy `` allāh '' exist in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_semitic_languages , including kb_hebrew_alphabet and kb_aramaic_alphabet . the corresponding kb_aramaic_alphabet kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism is `` kb_names_of_god_in_judaism#elah '' ( ) , but its kb_emphatic_consonant kb_state_of_matter is `` elaha '' ( ) . kb_it is written as ( `` ʼĕlāhā '' ) in kb_biblical_aramaic and ( `` ʼalâhâ '' ) in kb_syriac_alphabet as used by the kb_assyrian_christians , both kb_meaning_(linguistics) simply `` kb_god '' . kb_biblical_hebrew mostly uses the plural ( but functional singular ) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` kb_elohim '' ( ) , but more rarely kb_it also uses the singular kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` eloah '' ( ) .kb_regional_power variants of kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_allah '' occur in both kb_paganism and kb_christianity kb_pre-islamic_arabia kb_inscriptiones_graecae . different kb_theories have been kb_anatolian_hypothesis regarding the role of kb_allah in kb_pre-islamic_arabia kb_polytheism cults . some authors have suggested that polytheistic kb_arabs used the kb_toponymy as kb_a reference to kb_a kb_creator_god kb_god or kb_a kb_god kb_deity of their kb_pantheon_(religion) . the kb_terminology may have been vague in the kb_mecca kb_religion . according to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hypothesis , which goes back to kb_julius_wellhausen wellhausen , kb_allah ( the kb_god kb_deity of the tribal federation around kb_quraysh ) was kb_a designation that consecrated the superiority of kb_hubal ( the kb_god kb_deity of kb_quraysh ) over the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_deity . however , there is also kb_evidence_(law) that kb_allah and kb_hubal were kb_2_(number) distinct kb_deities . according to that hypothesis , the kb_kaaba was kb_first_trimester consecrated to kb_a kb_god kb_deity kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_allah and then hosted the kb_pantheon_(religion) of kb_quraysh after their kb_umayyad_conquest_of_hispania of kb_mecca , about kb_a century before the kb_time_(magazine) of kb_muhammad . some kb_inscriptiones_graecae seem to indicate the use of kb_allah as kb_a kb_toponymy of kb_a kb_polytheism kb_deity kb_century_(cricket) kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet , but we kb_know_nothing nothing precise about this use . some scholars have suggested that kb_allah may have represented kb_a remote kb_creator_god kb_god kb_world_health_organization was gradually kb_eclipsed by more particularized local kb_deities . there is disagreement on whether kb_allah played kb_a kb_major_(united_states) role in the meccan kb_religion kb_cult_(religious_practice) . no iconic kb_representation_(arts) of kb_allah is known to have existed . kb_allah is the only kb_god in kb_mecca that did not have an idol . kb_muhammad 's kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) 's kb_toponymy was kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` the slave of allāh '' .the kb_aramaic_alphabet word for `` kb_god '' in the kb_hunnic_language of kb_assyrian_christians is `` ʼĕlāhā '' , or `` alaha '' . arabic-speakers of all abrahamic faiths , including kb_christianity and kb_jews , use kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_allah '' to kb_mean `` kb_god '' . the kb_christianity kb_arabs of today have no kb_other_(philosophy) word for `` kb_god '' than `` kb_allah '' . ( even the arabic-descended kb_maltese_language kb_hunnic_language of kb_malta , whose kb_population is almost entirely kb_catholic_church , uses `` alla '' for `` kb_god '' . ) kb_arab_christians , for example , use the terms ' ( ) for kb_god_the_father kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , ' ( ) for kb_son_of_god son , and `` '' ( ) for kb_holy_spirit_in_christianity kb_holy_spirit kb_spirit .

''in kb_islam_and_abortion kb_tradition , there are kb_99_names_of_god names of kb_god ( `` '' lit . kb_meaning_(linguistics) : 'the best names ' or 'the most beautiful names ' ) , each of which evoke kb_a distinct kb_characteristic_(algebra) of kb_allah . all these names refer to kb_allah , the supreme and all-comprehensive kb_divinity kb_toponymy . among the kb_99_names_of_god names of kb_god , the most famous and most frequent of these names are `` the merciful '' ( `` kb_rahman_(name) '' ) and `` the compassionate '' ( `` '' ) .most kb_islam use the untranslated kb_arabic_alphabet phrase `` '' ( kb_meaning_(linguistics) 'if kb_god kb_will_(law) ' ) after references to future events . kb_muslim discursive kb_piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of `` '' ( kb_meaning_(linguistics) 'in the kb_toponymy of kb_god ' ) .there are certain phrases in praise of kb_god that are favored by kb_islam , including `` '' ( holiness kb_beryllium to kb_god ) , `` '' ( praise kb_beryllium to kb_god ) , `` '' ( there is no kb_deity but kb_god ) and `` '' ( kb_god is greater ) as kb_a devotional exercise of remembering kb_god ( kb_dhikr ) . in kb_a kb_sufi practice known as `` kb_dhikr kb_allah '' ( lit . remembrance of kb_god ) , the kb_sufi repeats and contemplates on the kb_toponymy `` kb_allah '' or kb_other_(philosophy) kb_divinity names while controlling kb_histidine or her breath .according to gerhard böwering , in kb_contrast_(vision) with kb_pre-islamic_arabia kb_arabian_plate kb_polytheism , kb_god_in_islam kb_islam does not have associates and companions , nor is there any kb_kinship between kb_god and kb_jinn . kb_pre-islamic_arabia kb_paganism kb_arabs believed in kb_a kb_blindness , powerful , inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control . this was replaced with the islamic notion of kb_a powerful but provident and merciful kb_god .according to kb_francis_edward_peters edward peters , `` the qur ’ ān insists , kb_islam kb_believe_(tv_series) , and historians affirm that kb_muhammad and kb_histidine followers kb_achilles#worship the same kb_god as the kb_jews ( ) . the qur ’ an 's kb_allah is the same kb_creator_god kb_god kb_world_health_organization covenanted with kb_abraham '' . peters kb_sovereign_state that the kb_quran portrays kb_allah as both more powerful and more remote than kb_yahweh , and as kb_a kb_universal_studios kb_deity , unlike kb_yahweh kb_world_health_organization closely follows kb_jews .in kb_order_(biology) to pronounce kb_the_word_(free_love) word kb_allah correctly , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) has to focus on the kb_second_language “ l ” ( ل ) in kb_allah ( الله ) . when kb_the_word_(free_love) word kb_allah is preceded by the kb_vowel “ kb_a ” ( فَتْحة ) or the kb_vowel “ kb_atomic_mass_unit ” ( ضَمّة ) , then the lām is pronounced in kb_a distinct heavy manner – with tafkhīm . this heavy lām is thus articulated with the entire kb_human_body of the tongue rather than its tip alone . for example , kb_ayah 58:22 : “ man haddaallah ” ( ِمَنْ حَادَّ الله ) which means : those kb_world_health_organization oppose kb_allah .if , however , the preceding kb_vowel is “ kb_iodine ” ( كَسْرة ) , then the lām in kb_allah is kb_light , such as in the kb_basmala : bismillahi ... ( ِبِسْمِ الله الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ ) . kb_sulfate if kb_a kb_muslim says “ bismillahi ” , kb_he_(letter) should not pronounce the lām with kb_a heavy kb_emphasis_(typography) – instead , just with the tip of the tongue .the kb_history of the kb_toponymy `` allāh '' in kb_australian_english was probably influenced by the kb_science of kb_comparative_religion kb_religion in the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century ; for example , kb_thomas_carlyle ( 1840 ) sometimes used the kb_terminology kb_allah but without any kb_entailment that kb_allah was anything different from kb_god . however , in kb_histidine kb_biography of muḥammad ( 1934 ) , kb_tor_andræ andræ always used the kb_terminology `` kb_allah '' , though kb_he_(letter) allows that this `` kb_human_fertilization of kb_god '' seems to imply that kb_it is different from that of the kb_jews and kb_christianity theologies .languages which may not commonly use the kb_terminology `` kb_allah '' to denote kb_god may still contain popular expressions which use kb_the_word_(free_love) word . for example , because of the kb_century_(cricket) kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_al-andalus in the kb_iberian_peninsula , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` ojalá '' in the kb_spanish_empire kb_hunnic_language and `` oxalá '' in the kb_portuguese_language exist today , kb_loanword from kb_arabic_alphabet `` kb_inshalla '' ( kb_arabic_alphabet : إن شاء الله ) . this phrase literally means 'if kb_god kb_will_(law) ' ( in the kb_word_sense of `` kb_iodine hope kb_sulfate '' ) . the kb_german_language kb_poet kb_siegfried_august_mahlmann used the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` kb_allah '' as the kb_title of kb_a poem about the ultimate kb_deity , though kb_it is unclear how much kb_judeo-islamic_philosophies_(800–1400) thought kb_he_(letter) kb_intention to convey .some kb_islam leave the kb_toponymy `` allāh '' untranslated in kb_australian_english . kb_the_word_(free_love) word has also been kb_applied_science to certain living kb_human_kind as kb_anthropomorphismkb_christianity in kb_malaysia and kb_indonesia use `` kb_allah '' to refer to kb_god in the kb_malaysian_language and kb_indonesian_language languages ( both of them standardized kb_theory_of_forms of the kb_malay_language ) . kb_mainstream_(terminology) kb_bible translations in the kb_hunnic_language use `` kb_allah '' as the kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century of kb_hebrew_alphabet `` kb_elohim '' ( translated in kb_australian_english kb_bibles as `` kb_god '' ) . this goes back to early kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century kb_cold_working by kb_francis_xavier xavier in the 16th century . the kb_first_trimester dictionary of dutch-malay by kb_albert_speer_(born_1934) cornelius ruyl , justus heurnius , and caspar wiltens in 1650 ( revised edition from 1623 edition and 1631 kb_latin edition ) recorded `` kb_allah '' as the kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century of the kb_dutch_language word `` kb_:en:god '' . ruyl also translated the kb_gospel_of_matthew matthew in 1612 into the kb_malay_language ( an early kb_bible kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century into kb_a non-european kb_hunnic_language ,made kb_a year after the publication of the kb_king_james_version version ) , which was printed in kb_netherlands kb_netherlands in 1629. then kb_he_(letter) translated the kb_gospel_of_mark kb_mark_waugh , published in 1638 .the kb_government_of_malaysia kb_malaysia in kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final

kb_massachusetts_government_act kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law , ruling kb_it kb_constitutionality . while `` kb_allah '' had been used for the kb_christianity kb_god in kb_malay_language for more than four kb_century_(cricket) , the contemporary kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war was triggered by usage of `` kb_allah '' by the kb_catholic_church newspaper `` the herald '' . the kb_government_of_angola appealed the kb_court ruling , and the kb_high_middle_ages kb_court suspended implementation of its verdict until the kb_hearing_loss of the kb_appeal . in kb_october kb_2013_mediterranean_games the kb_court ruled in favor of the kb_government_of_angola 's kb_ban_(unit) . in early 2014 the kb_malaysian_language kb_government_of_angola confiscated more than 300 kb_bibles for using kb_the_word_(free_love) word to refer to the kb_christianity kb_god in peninsular kb_malaysia . however , the use of `` kb_allah '' is not prohibited in the kb_2_(number) kb_malaysian_language kb_sovereign_state of kb_sabah and kb_sarawak . the main kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving kb_it is not prohibited in these kb_2_(number) kb_sovereign_state is that usage

kb_turkic_languages , the early precursor of the kb_azerbaijani_language of today . some kb_linguistics have also stated that the kb_tat_language_(caucasus) dialects of kb_azerbaijan_(iran) kb_azerbaijan and the kb_republic_of_azerbaijan kb_azerbaijan , like those spoken by the kb_tat_people_(caucasus) , are descended from kb_old_azeri_language . locally , the possessions of the subsequent kb_seljuk_empire were ruled by kb_eldiguzids , kb_de_jure kb_vassals of the kb_seljuk_(warlord) sultans , but sometimes `` kb_de_facto '' rulers themselves . under the seljuks , local poets such as kb_nizami_ganjavi and kb_khaqani gave rise to kb_a blossoming of kb_persian_literature on the kb_territories_of_the_united_states of present-day kb_azerbaijan .the local kb_dynasty of the

kb_qajar_dynasty kb_iran 's loss in the 1804–1813 kb_war , kb_it was forced to concede kb_suzerainty over most of the khanates , along with kb_georgia_(u.s._state) and kb_dagestan to the

observing or imaging celestial kb_object_relations_theory in the kb_sky using the kb_naked_eye kb_human_eye , kb_binoculars , or kb_optical_telescope . even though kb_scientific_method kb_research may not kb_beryllium their kb_primary_education goal , some amateur astronomers make contributions in doing kb_citizen_science , such as by monitoring kb_variable_stars stars , kb_double_stars stars sunspots , or occultations of stars by the kb_moon or kb_asteroids , or by discovering transient kb_astronomical events , such as comets , galactic novae or kb_supernovae in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_galaxy .amateur astronomers do not use the field of kb_astronomy as their kb_primary_education source of kb_income or support , and usually have no kb_professional_degree kb_degree_(angle) in kb_astrophysics or advanced academic kb_military_education_and_training in the kb_grammatical_subject . most kb_amateurs are beginners or hobbyists , while others have kb_a kb_high_middle_ages kb_degree_(angle) of experience in kb_astronomy and may often assist and kb_cold_working alongside professional astronomers . many astronomers have studied the kb_sky throughout kb_history in an amateur framework ; however , since kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the twentieth century , professional kb_astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy and associated activities .amateur astronomers typically view the kb_sky at night , when most celestial kb_object_relations_theory and kb_astronomical events are visible , but others observe during the daytime by viewing the kb_sun and solar eclipses . some just kb_look_(american_magazine) at the kb_sky using nothing more than their eyes or kb_binoculars , but more dedicated kb_amateurs often use portable kb_optical_telescope or kb_optical_telescope kb_situated in their kb_private_aviation or club kb_observatory . kb_amateurs can also join as members of amateur kb_astronomical_societycollectively , amateur astronomers observe kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of celestial kb_object_relations_theory and kb_phenomenon . common targets of amateur astronomers include the kb_moon , planets , stars , comets , meteor showers , and kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of deep kb_sky kb_object_relations_theory such as kb_star clusters , kb_galaxy , and nebulae . many kb_amateurs like to specialise in observing kb_particular kb_object_relations_theory , types of kb_object_relations_theory , or types of events which kb_interest them . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) branch of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy , amateur kb_astrophotography , involves the taking of photos of the night kb_sky . kb_astrophotography has become more popular with the introduction of far easier to use equipment including , kb_apple_quicktake , kb_dslr cameras and relatively sophisticated purpose built kb_high_middle_ages quality kb_charge-coupled_device cameras .most amateur astronomers kb_cold_working at visible kb_electromagnetic_spectrum , but kb_a small minority kb_experiment with kb_electromagnetic_spectrum outside the kb_visible_spectrum kb_visible_spectrum . an early pioneer of kb_radio_astronomy was kb_grote_reber reber , an amateur kb_astronomer kb_world_health_organization constructed the kb_first_trimester purpose built kb_radio_telescope in the late 1930s to follow up on the discovery of kb_radio_frequency kb_greenhouse_gas#direct_greenhouse_gas_emissions from kb_space by kb_karl_guthe_jansky jansky . non-visual kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy includes the use of kb_infrared kb_optical_filter on conventional kb_optical_telescope , and also the use of kb_radio kb_optical_telescope . some amateur astronomers use home-made kb_radio kb_optical_telescope , while others use kb_radio kb_optical_telescope that were originally built for kb_astronomical kb_research but have since been made kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance for use by kb_amateurs . the kb_one-mile_telescope kb_telescopeamateur astronomers use kb_a range of instruments to kb_science the kb_sky , depending on kb_a combination of their interests and resources . methods include simply looking at the night kb_sky with the kb_naked_eye kb_human_eye , using kb_binoculars , and using kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of optical kb_optical_telescope of varying kb_power_(physics) and quality , as kb_water_well as additional sophisticated equipment , such as cameras , to kb_science kb_light from the kb_sky in both the visual and non-visual parts of the kb_visible_spectrum . commercial kb_optical_telescope are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance , kb_new_world and used , but kb_it is also common for amateur astronomers to build ( or commission the building of ) their own custom kb_optical_telescope . some kb_people_(american_magazine) even focus on kb_amateur_telescope_making kb_telescope making as their kb_primary_education kb_interest within the kb_hobby of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy .although specialized and experienced amateur astronomers tend to acquire more specialized and more powerful equipment over kb_time_(magazine) , relatively kb_simple_polygon equipment is often preferred for certain kb_task_(computing) . kb_binoculars , for instance , although generally of lower kb_power_(physics) than the majority of kb_optical_telescope , also tend to provide kb_a wider kb_field_of_view of view , which is preferable for looking at some kb_object_relations_theory in the night kb_sky .amateur astronomers also use kb_star charts that , depending on experience and intentions , may range from kb_simple_polygon planispheres through to detailed charts of very specific areas of the night kb_sky . kb_a range of kb_astronomy software is kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance and used by amateur astronomers , including software that generates maps of the kb_sky , software to assist with kb_astrophotography , kb_observation scheduling software , and software to perform various calculations pertaining to kb_astronomical kb_phenomenon .amateur astronomers often like to keep kb_record_(computer_science) of their kb_observations_(pierre_belon) , which usually takes the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of an observing log . observing logs typically record details about which kb_object_relations_theory were observed and when , as kb_water_well as describing the details that were seen . sketching is sometimes used within logs , and photographic kb_record_(computer_science) of kb_observations_(pierre_belon) have also been used in recent times . the kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) gathered is used to help studies and kb_interaction_(statistics) between amateur astronomers in yearly gatherings . although not professional kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) or credible , kb_it is kb_a way for the kb_hobby lovers to share their kb_new_world sightings and experiences .kb_the_internet kb_internet is an kb_essential_element kb_tool of amateur astronomers . the popularity of imaging among kb_amateurs has kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of kb_world_wide_web sites kb_being written by individuals about their images and equipment . much of the kb_social_interaction of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy occurs on kb_mailing_lists lists or discussion kb_group_(mathematics) . discussion kb_group_(periodic_table) servers host numerous kb_astronomy lists . kb_a great deal of the commerce of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy , the buying and selling of equipment , occurs online . many kb_amateurs use online tools to plan their nightly observing sessions , using tools such as the kb_clear_sky_chart kb_sky chart .while kb_a kb_grammatical_number of interesting celestial kb_object_relations_theory are readily kb_interpretatio_graeca by the kb_naked_eye kb_human_eye , sometimes with the kb_aid of kb_a kb_star_chart , many others are kb_sulfate faint or inconspicuous that technical means are necessary to locate them . although many methods are used in kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy , most are variations of kb_a few specific techniques .kb_star hopping is kb_a method often used by amateur astronomers with low-tech equipment such as kb_binoculars or kb_a manually driven kb_telescope . kb_it involves the use of maps ( or kb_memory ) to locate known landmark stars , and `` hopping '' between them , often with the kb_aid of kb_a kb_finderscope . because of its simplicity , kb_star hopping is kb_a very common method for finding kb_object_relations_theory that are close to naked-eye stars .more advanced methods of locating kb_object_relations_theory in the kb_sky include kb_telescope mounts with `` kb_setting_circles circles '' , which assist with pointing kb_optical_telescope to positions in the kb_sky that are known to contain kb_object_relations_theory of kb_interest , and `` goto kb_optical_telescope '' , which are fully kb_automated kb_optical_telescope that are capable of locating kb_object_relations_theory on demand ( having kb_first_trimester been kb_calibration ) .the kb_advent of kb_battle_of_mobile_(1781) applications for use in kb_smartphones has kb_light-emitting_diode to the creation of many dedicated apps . these apps allow any kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) to easily locate celestial kb_object_relations_theory of kb_interest by simply pointing the kb_smartphone kb_analyzer in that direction in the kb_sky . these apps make use of the inbuilt kb_computer_hardware in the phone , such as kb_gps kb_location_(sign_language) and kb_gyroscope . useful kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) about the pointed kb_space_debris like kb_celestial_coordinates coordinates , the kb_toponymy of the kb_space_debris , its kb_constellation , etc . are provided for kb_a quick reference . some paid versions give more kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) . these apps are gradually getting into regular use during observing , for the alignment process of kb_optical_telescope .kb_setting_circles circles are kb_angular_measurement measurement kb_fish_scale that can kb_beryllium placed on the kb_2_(number) main kb_rotation_around_a_fixed_axis of some kb_optical_telescope . since the widespread adoption of kb_digital_data kb_setting_circles circles , any kb_classical_conditioning engraved setting kb_circle is now specifically kb_interpretatio_graeca as an `` kb_analog_device setting kb_circle '' ( asc ) . by knowing the coordinates of an kb_space_debris ( usually given in kb_equatorial_coordinates coordinates ) , the kb_telescope kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) can use the setting kb_circle to align ( i.e. , point ) the kb_telescope in the appropriate direction before looking through its kb_eyepiece . kb_a computerized setting kb_circle is called kb_a `` kb_digital_data setting kb_circle '' ( dsc ) . although kb_digital_data kb_setting_circles circles can kb_beryllium used to kb_computer_monitor kb_a kb_telescope 's kb_radium and kb_declination coordinates , they are not simply kb_a kb_digital_data read-out of what can kb_beryllium seen on the kb_telescope 's kb_analog_device kb_setting_circles circles . as with go-to kb_optical_telescope , kb_digital_data setting kb_circle computers ( commercial names include kb_argo navis , kb_sky commander , and ngc max ) contain databases of tens of thousands of celestial kb_object_relations_theory and projections of kb_planet positions .to find kb_a celestial kb_space_debris in kb_a kb_telescope equipped with kb_a dsc kb_apollo_guidance_computer , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) does not need to kb_look_(american_magazine) up the specific kb_radium and kb_declination coordinates in kb_a book or kb_other_(philosophy) resource , and then adjust the kb_telescope to those numerical readings . rather , the kb_space_debris is chosen from the kb_electronic_computer database , which kb_causes_of_autism kb_distance values and kb_arrow_(weapon) markers to appear in the kb_computer_monitor that indicate the kb_distance and direction to move the kb_telescope . the kb_telescope is moved until the kb_2_(number) angular kb_distance values reach kb_0_(number) , indicating that the kb_telescope is properly aligned . when both the kb_radium and kb_declination axes are thus `` zeroed out '' , the kb_space_debris should kb_beryllium in the kb_eyepiece . many dscs , like go-to kb_systems_analysis , can also kb_cold_working in conjunction with laptop kb_sky programs .computerized kb_systems_analysis provide the further advantage of kb_computing kb_coordinate kb_precession . traditional printed sources are subtitled by the `` kb_epoch_(astronomy) '' year , which refers to the positions of celestial kb_object_relations_theory at kb_a given kb_time_(magazine) to the nearest year ( e.g. , j2005 , j2007 ) . most such printed sources have been updated for intervals of only about every fifty years ( e.g. , j1900 , j1950 , j2000 ) . computerized sources , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , are able to calculate the kb_right_ascension and kb_declination of the `` kb_epoch_(astronomy) of date '' to the exact instant of kb_observation .goto kb_optical_telescope have become more popular since the 1980s as kb_technology has improved and prices have been kb_redox . with these computer-driven kb_optical_telescope , the kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) typically enters the kb_toponymy of the item of kb_interest and the kb_mechanics of the kb_telescope point the kb_telescope towards that item automatically . they have several notable advantages for amateur astronomers intent on kb_research . for example , goto kb_optical_telescope tend to kb_beryllium faster for locating items of kb_interest than kb_star hopping , allowing more kb_time_(magazine) for studying of the kb_space_debris . goto also allows manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler alt-azimuth kb_telescope mounts , allowing them to produce an overall less expensive kb_decay_product . goto kb_optical_telescope usually have to kb_beryllium kb_calibration using alignment stars in kb_order_(biology) to provide accurate tracking and positioning . however , several kb_telescope manufacturers have recently kb_adaptation kb_telescope kb_systems_analysis that are kb_calibration with the use of built-in kb_gps , decreasing the kb_time_(magazine) kb_it takes to kb_set_(mythology) up kb_a kb_telescope at the start of an observing session .with the development of fast kb_internet in the last part of the 20th century along with advances in kb_apollo_guidance_computer controlled kb_telescope mounts and kb_charge-coupled_device cameras `` remote kb_telescope '' kb_astronomy is now kb_a viable means for amateur astronomers not aligned with kb_major_(united_states) kb_telescope facilities to partake in kb_research and deep kb_sky imaging . this enables anyone to control kb_a kb_telescope kb_a great kb_distance away in kb_a dark kb_location_(sign_language) . the observer can image through the kb_telescope using kb_charge-coupled_device cameras . the kb_digital_data kb_big_data collected by the kb_telescope is then transmitted and displayed to the kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) by means of kb_the_internet kb_internet . an example of kb_a kb_digital_data remote kb_telescope operation for kb_public_domain_(land) via kb_the_internet kb_internet is the kb_bareket_observatory observatory , and there are kb_telescope farms in kb_new_mexico , kb_australia and kb_atacama_desert#astronomical_observatories in kb_chile .amateur astronomers engage in many imaging techniques including kb_film , kb_dslr , kb_lrgb , and kb_charge-coupled_device kb_astrophotography . because kb_charge-coupled_device imagers are kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history , kb_image_processing kb_fish_processingkb_scientific_method kb_research is most often not the `` main '' goal for many amateur astronomers , unlike professional astronomers . kb_cold_working of kb_scientific_method merit is possible , however , and many kb_amateurs successfully contribute to the kb_knowledge_representation kb_base_(chemistry) of professional astronomers . kb_astronomy is sometimes promoted as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the few remaining kb_sciences for which kb_amateurs can still contribute useful kb_big_data . to recognize this , the kb_astronomical_society_of_the_pacific of the kb_pacific_ocean annually gives kb_amateur_achievement_award_of_astronomical_society_of_the_pacific achievement awards for significant contributions to kb_astronomy by kb_amateurs .the majority of kb_scientific_method contributions by amateur astronomers are in the kb_area of kb_big_data kb_class_(set_theory) . in kb_particular , this applies where kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of amateur astronomers with small kb_optical_telescope are more effective than the relatively small kb_grammatical_number of kb_prespa_lake kb_optical_telescope that are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance to professional astronomers . several organizations , such as the kb_american_association_of_variable_star_observers of kb_variable_star kb_star observers , exist to help kb_coordinate these contributions .amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of kb_variable_stars stars and kb_supernovae , helping to track kb_asteroids , and observing occultations to determine both the kb_shape of kb_asteroids and the kb_shape of the kb_terrain_(journal) on the apparent kb_enhanced_data_rates_for_gsm_evolution of the kb_moon as seen from kb_earth . with more advanced equipment , but still cheap in comparison to professional setups , amateur astronomers can kb_measure_(mathematics) the kb_light kb_visible_spectrum emitted from kb_astronomical kb_object_relations_theory , which can yield high-quality kb_scientific_method kb_big_data if the measurements are performed with due care . kb_a relatively recent role for amateur astronomers is searching for overlooked kb_phenomenon ( e.g. , kb_kreutz_sungrazers sungrazers ) in the vast libraries of kb_digital_data images and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_big_data captured by kb_earth and kb_space based kb_observatory , much of which is kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance over kb_the_internet kb_internet .in the kb_past and present , amateur astronomers have played kb_a kb_major_(united_states) role in discovering kb_new_world comets . recently however , funding of projects such as the kb_linear kb_asteroid kb_research and kb_near_earth_asteroid_tracking kb_earth kb_asteroid tracking projects has meant that most comets are now discovered by kb_automated kb_systems_analysis kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) before kb_it is possible for kb_amateurs to kb_episcopal_see them .there are kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of amateur kb_astronomical_society around the kb_world_war_ii , that serve as kb_a meeting point for those interested in kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy . members range from active observers with their own equipment to `` armchair astronomers '' kb_world_health_organization are simply interested in the kb_topic_(linguistics) . kb_society range widely in their goals and activities , which may depend on kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of factors such as geographic kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) , local circumstances , size , and membership . for example , kb_a small local society located in dark countryside may focus on practical observing and kb_star_parties , whereas kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) based in kb_a kb_major_(united_states) kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey might have numerous members but kb_beryllium limited by kb_light_pollution and thus hold regular indoor meetings with guest kb_appledesign_powered_speakers instead . kb_major_(united_states) national or international kb_society generally publish their own kb_academic_journal or kb_newsletter , and some hold kb_prespa_lake multi-day meetings akin to kb_a kb_scientific_conference or kb_fan_convention . they may also have sections devoted to kb_particular topics , such as kb_observing_the_moon the kb_moon or kb_amateur_telescope_making kb_telescope making .category : kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomycategory : kb_article_(grammar) containing kb_video kb_clips_(software)category : kb_citizen_scienceaikido 's techniques include : kb_irimi ( entering ) , and kb_tenkan ( turning ) movements ( that redirect the opponent 's attack kb_momentum ) , various types of kb_throw_(grappling) and joint locks .aikido derives mainly from the kb_martial_art kb_art of kb_daitō-ryū_aiki-jūjutsu aiki-jūjutsu , but began to diverge from kb_it in the late 1920s , partly due to ueshiba 's involvement with the kb_oomotokb_the_word_(free_love) word `` aikido '' is formed of kb_triliteral kb_kanji :the kb_terminology `` kb_aiki_(martial_arts_principle) '' does not readily appear in the kb_japanese_film kb_hunnic_language outside the kb_scope_(mouthwash) of kb_budō . this has kb_light-emitting_diode to many possible interpretations of kb_the_word_(free_love) word .the kb_terminology is also found in kb_martial_arts kb_arts such as kb_judo and kb_kendo , and in various non-martial kb_arts , such as kb_japanese_calligraphy ( ) , kb_ikebana ( ) and kb_japanese_tea_ceremonyueshiba kb_adaptation aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older kb_martial_arts kb_arts that kb_he_(letter) had studied . the core kb_martial_art kb_art from which aikido derives is kb_daitō-ryū_aiki-jūjutsu aiki-jūjutsu , which ueshiba studied directly with kb_takeda_sōkaku sōkaku , the reviver of that kb_art . additionally , ueshiba is known to have studied kb_tenjin_shinyo_ryu shin'yō-ryū with tozawa tokusaburō in kb_tokyo in 1901 , kb_yagyū_shingan-ryū yagyū shingan-ryū under nakai masakatsu in kb_sakai,_osaka from 1903 to 1908 , and kb_judo with kiyoichi takagi ( , 1894–1972 ) in kb_tanabe in kb_1911_in_argentine_football .the kb_art of daitō-ryū is the kb_primary_education technical influence on aikido . along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques , ueshiba incorporated kb_military_education_and_training movements with weapons , such as those for the kb_spear ( ) , short kb_stick_fighting ( ) , and perhaps the . however , aikido derives much of its technical kb_structure from the kb_art of swordsmanship ( ) .ueshiba moved to kb_hokkaidōafter ueshiba kb_left-wing_politics kb_hokkaidō in 1919 , kb_he_(letter) kb_methionine and was profoundly influenced by kb_onisaburo_deguchi deguchi , the kb_spirituality kb_leader of the kb_oomoto kb_religion ( kb_a neo-shinto kb_movement_(sign_language) ) in kb_ayabe . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_primary_education features of kb_oomoto is its kb_emphasis_(typography) on the attainment of kb_utopia during kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's kb_life_(magazine) . this was kb_a great influence on ueshiba 's kb_martial_arts kb_arts kb_philosophy of extending kb_love and compassion especially to those kb_world_health_organization seek to harm others . aikido demonstrates this kb_philosophy in its kb_emphasis_(typography) on mastering kb_martial_arts kb_arts kb_sulfate that kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect kb_it . in an kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_optical_resolution , not only is the receiver unharmed , but kb_sulfate is the attacker .in kb_addition to the effect on kb_histidine kb_spirituality growth , the connection with deguchi gave ueshiba kb_azerbaijan_in_the_eurovision_song_contest_2009 to elite kb_politics and kb_military circles as kb_a martial kb_artist . as kb_a result of this exposure , kb_he_(letter) was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students . several of these students would found their own kb_art_movement of aikido .aikido was kb_first_trimester brought to the rest of the kb_world_war_ii in kb_1951_in_literature by kb_minoru_mochizuki mochizuki with kb_a visit to kb_france where kb_he_(letter) introduced aikido techniques to kb_judo students . kb_he_(letter) was followed by kb_tadashi_abe abe in 1952 , kb_world_health_organization came as the official kb_aikikai_hombu hombu representative , remaining in kb_france for seven years . kb_kenji_tomiki tomiki toured with kb_a delegation of various kb_martial_arts kb_arts through 15 kb_continental_dollar kb_sovereign_state of the united kb_sovereign_state in 1953. later that year , kb_koichi_tohei tohei was sent by kb_aikikai_hombu hombu to kb_hawaii for kb_a full year , where kb_he_(letter) kb_set_(mythology) up several kb_dojo . this trip was followed by several further visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the united kb_sovereign_state . the kb_united_kingdom kb_kingdom_(biology) followed in 1955 ; kb_italy in kb_united_states_presidential_election,_1964 by kb_hiroshi_tada tada ; and kb_germany in 1965 by kb_katsuaki_asai asai . designated `` official delegate for kb_europe and kb_africa '' by morihei ueshiba , kb_masamichi_noro noro arrived in kb_france in september 1961. kb_seiichi_sugano sugano was appointed to introduce aikido to kb_australia in 1965. today there are aikido kb_dojo throughout the kb_world_war_ii .the kb_largest_organisms aikido organization is the kb_aikikai_foundation kb_foundation_(engineering) , which remains under the control of the ueshiba kb_family_(biology) . however , aikido has many kb_art_movement , mostly formed by morihei ueshiba 's kb_major_(united_states) students .the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century independent kb_art_movement to emerge were kb_yoseikan_aikido aikido , begun by kb_minoru_mochizuki mochizuki in 1931 , kb_yoshinkan , founded by kb_gozo_shioda in 1955 , and kb_shodokan_aikido aikido , founded by kb_kenji_tomiki tomiki in 1967. the emergence of these kb_art_movement pre-dated ueshiba 's kb_death and did not cause any kb_major_(united_states) upheavals when they were formalized . kb_shodokan_aikido aikido , however , was controversial , since kb_it introduced kb_a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the kb_spirit of aikido .after ueshiba 's kb_death in 1969 , kb_2_(number) more kb_major_(united_states) kb_art_movement kb_declaration_of_independence_of_albania . significant kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war arose with the departure of the kb_aikikai_hombu_dojo kb_dojo 's kb_tribal_chief instructor kb_koichi_tohei tohei , in 1974. tohei kb_left-wing_politics as kb_a result of kb_a disagreement with the son of the founder , kb_kisshomaru_ueshiba ueshiba , kb_world_health_organization at that kb_time_(magazine) headed the kb_aikikai_foundation kb_foundation_(engineering) . the disagreement was over the proper role of `` kb_qi '' development in regular

organization that governs kb_it , the kb_ki_society ( `` kb_qi no kenkyūkai '' ) .kb_a final kb_major_(united_states) kb_carpel kb_evolution_of_tetrapods from ueshiba 's retirement in iwama , ibaraki and the teaching kb_methodology of kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_terminology student kb_morihiro_saito saito . kb_it is unofficially referred to as the `` kb_iwama_style kb_carpel '' , and at kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) point kb_a kb_grammatical_number of its followers formed kb_a loose network of schools they called kb_iwama_ryu ryu . although kb_iwama_style kb_carpel practitioners remained part of the aikikai until saito 's kb_death in kb_2002_australian_open , followers of saito subsequently split into kb_2_(number) kb_group_(mathematics) . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) remained with the aikikai and the kb_other_(philosophy) formed the independent kb_shinshin_aikishuren_kai aikishuren kai in kb_2004_summer_olympics around saito 's son kb_hitohiro_saito saitothe kb_science of `` kb_qi '' is an important component of aikido , and its kb_science defies categorization as either `` kb_health '' or `` kb_mental_health '' kb_military_education_and_training , as kb_it encompasses both . the `` kb_kanji '' for `` kb_qi '' normally is written as . kb_it was written as until the kb_tōyō_kanji reforms after kb_world_war_ii kb_war ii , and this older kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism still is seen on occasion .the kb_character_(computing) for `` kb_qi '' is used in everyday kb_japanese_film terms , such as , or . `` kb_qi '' has many meanings , including `` ambience '' , `` kb_mind '' , `` mood '' , and `` intention '' , however , in traditional kb_martial_arts kb_arts kb_it is often used to refer to `` kb_life_(magazine) kb_energy_industry '' . kb_gozo_shioda shioda 's kb_yoshinkan , considered kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the `` hard kb_art_movement '' , largely follows ueshiba 's teachings from before kb_world_war_ii kb_war ii , and surmises that the secret to `` kb_qi '' lies in timing and the kb_application_(computing) of the whole kb_human_body 's kb_strength_of_materials to kb_a kb_single_bond point . in later years , ueshiba 's kb_application_(computing) of `` kb_qi '' in aikido took on kb_a softer , more gentle kb_sentience . this was kb_histidine kb_takemusu kb_aiki_(martial_arts_principle) and many of kb_histidine later students teach about `` kb_qi '' from this perspective . kb_koichi_tohei tohei 's kb_ki_society centers almost exclusively around the kb_science of the kb_empirical_evidence ( albeit subjective ) experience of `` kb_qi '' with students kb_historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_united_states#scholar_survey_results separately in aikido techniques and `` kb_qi '' development .in aikido , as in virtually all kb_japanese_film kb_martial_arts kb_arts , there are both kb_health and kb_mental_health aspects of kb_military_education_and_training . the kb_health kb_military_education_and_training in aikido is diverse , covering both kb_general_(united_states) kb_health kb_fitness_(biology) and kb_physical_exercise , as kb_water_well as specific techniques . because kb_a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of kb_throw_(grappling) , beginners learn how to safely fall or roll . the specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs ; the techniques for kb_defense_(legal) consist of kb_throw_(grappling) and kb_pinning_holdkb_health kb_military_education_and_training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled kb_relaxation_technique , correct kb_movement_(sign_language) of joints such as hips and shoulders , kb_flexibility_(anatomy) , and kb_endurance , with less kb_emphasis_(typography) on kb_strength_training . in aikido , pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements . this distinction can kb_beryllium kb_applied_science to kb_general_(united_states) kb_fitness_(biology) goals for the aikido practitioner .in aikido , specific muscles or kb_muscle kb_group_(mathematics) are not kb_isolationism and worked to improve kb_tone_(linguistics) , kb_mass_(liturgy) , or kb_power_(physics) . aikido-related kb_military_education_and_training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body kb_movement_(sign_language) and kb_formal_balance similar to kb_yoga or kb_pilates . for example , many dojos begin each kb_class_(biology) with , which may include kb_stretching and kb_uke_(martial_arts) ( break falls ) .aikido kb_military_education_and_training is based primarily on kb_2_(number) partners practicing pre-arranged kb_theory_of_forms ( `` kb_kata '' ) rather than freestyle practice . the kb_base_(chemistry) kb_pattern is for the receiver of the technique ( `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' ) to initiate an attack against the kb_grammatical_person kb_world_health_organization applies the technique—the `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , or `` shite '' ( depending on aikido kb_carpel ) , also referred to as `` nage '' ( when applying kb_a throwing technique ) , kb_world_health_organization neutralises this attack with an aikido technique .both halves of the technique , that of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' and that of `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , are considered kb_essential_element to aikido kb_military_education_and_training . both are studying aikido principles of blending and kb_adaptation . `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' learns to blend with and control attacking kb_energy_industry , while `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous , off-balance positions in which `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' places them . this `` receiving '' of the technique is called `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' . `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' continuously seeks to regain kb_formal_balance and cover vulnerabilities ( e.g. , an exposed side ) , while `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' uses kb_positional_notation and timing to keep `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' off-balance and vulnerable . in more advanced kb_military_education_and_training , `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' kb_will_and_testament sometimes apply to regain kb_formal_balance and pin or kb_throw_(grappling) `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' .aikido techniques are usually kb_a kb_defense_(legal) against an attack , kb_sulfate students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to kb_beryllium able to practice aikido with kb_a partner . although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based kb_arts , sincere attacks ( kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_strike_action or an immobilizing grab ) are needed to kb_science correct and effective kb_application_(computing) of technique .many of the of aikido resemble cuts from kb_a kb_sword or kb_other_(philosophy) grasped kb_space_debris , which indicate its origins in techniques kb_intention for kb_weapon kb_combat_(newspaper) . kb_other_(philosophy) techniques , which explicitly appear to kb_beryllium punches ( `` kb_tsuki '' ) , are practiced as thrusts with kb_a kb_knife or kb_sword . kicks are generally reserved for upper-level variations ; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous , and that kicks ( kb_high_middle_ages kicks in kb_particular ) were uncommon during the types of kb_combat_(newspaper) prevalent in kb_feudal kb_japan . some kb_base_(chemistry) strikes include :beginners in kb_particular often practice techniques from grabs , both because they are safer and because kb_it is easier to kb_sentience the kb_energy_industry and lines of kb_force of kb_a hold than kb_a kb_strike_action . some grabs are kb_history kb_derived_trait from kb_being held while trying to draw kb_a kb_katanaaikido makes use of kb_human_body kb_movement_(sign_language) ( `` kb_tai_sabaki sabaki '' ) to blend with `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' . for example , an `` entering '' ( `` kb_irimi '' ) technique consists of movements inward towards `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , while kb_a technique uses kb_a pivoting kb_motion_(physics) .additionally , an technique takes kb_place_of_articulation in front of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , whereas an technique takes kb_place_of_articulation to their side ; kb_a technique is kb_applied_science with kb_motion_(physics) to the front of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , and kb_a version is kb_applied_science with kb_motion_(physics) towards the rear of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , usually by incorporating kb_a turning or pivoting kb_motion_(physics) . finally , most techniques can kb_beryllium performed while in kb_a seated posture ( `` kb_seiza '' ) . techniques where both `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' and `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' are standing are called `` tachi-waza '' , techniques where both start off in `` kb_seiza '' are called `` suwari-waza '' , and techniques performed with `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' standing and `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' sitting are called `` hanmi handachi '' ( ) .thus , from fewer than twenty kb_base_(chemistry) techniques , there are thousands of possible implementations . for instance , `` ikkyō '' can kb_beryllium kb_applied_science to an opponent moving forward with kb_a kb_strike_action ( perhaps with an `` ura '' kb_type_(biology) of kb_movement_(sign_language) to redirect the incoming kb_force ) , or to an opponent kb_world_health_organization has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish kb_distance ( perhaps an `` omote-waza '' version ) . specific aikido `` kb_kata '' are typically referred to with the kb_chemical_formula `` attack-technique ( -modifier ) '' . for instance , `` katate-dori ikkyō '' refers to any `` ikkyō '' technique kb_execution_(computing) when `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' is holding kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_wrist . this could kb_beryllium further specified as `` katate-dori ikkyō omote '' , referring to any forward-moving `` ikkyō '' technique from that grab .`` kb_atemi '' ( ) are strikes ( or feints ) employed during an aikido technique . some view `` kb_atemi '' as attacks against `` kb_pressure_point points '' meant to cause damage in and of themselves . for instance , kb_gozo_shioda shiodaweapons kb_military_education_and_training in aikido traditionally includes the short kb_stick_fighting ( `` kb_jō '' ) although its techniques resemble closely the use of the bayonet or kb_jūkendō , the wooden kb_sword ( `` kb_bokken '' ) , and the kb_knife ( `` kb_tantō '' ) . some schools incorporate firearm-disarming techniques . both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are taught . some schools , such as the kb_iwama_style kb_carpel of kb_morihiro_saito saito , usually spend substantial kb_time_(magazine) practicing with both `` kb_bokken '' and `` kb_jō '' , under the names of `` kb_aiki-ken '' , and `` kb_aiki-jō '' , respectively .the founder kb_adaptation many of the empty-handed techniques from traditional kb_sword , kb_spear and bayonet movements . consequently , the practice of the weapons kb_arts gives insight into the kb_evolution of techniques and movements , and reinforces the concepts of kb_distance , timing , kb_hiking kb_movement_(sign_language) , presence and connectedness with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's kb_military_education_and_training partner ( kb_sulfur ) .kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_i_shot_andy_warhol of aikido is kb_military_education_and_training to defend against kb_cross-platform_software attackers , often called `` taninzudori '' , or `` taninzugake '' . freestyle practice with kb_cross-platform_software attackers called `` kb_randori '' ( ) is kb_a kb_key_(cryptography) part of most curricula and is required for the higher level ranks . `` kb_randori '' exercises kb_a kb_grammatical_person 's ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment . kb_geostrategy kb_utility of techniques , based on how they reposition the student relative to kb_other_(philosophy) attackers , is important in `` kb_randori '' kb_military_education_and_training . for instance , an `` ura '' technique might kb_beryllium used to neutralise the kb_electric_current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind .in kb_shodokan_aikido aikido , `` kb_randori '' differs in that kb_it is not performed with kb_cross-platform_software persons with kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity roles of kb_defender_(video_game) and attacker , but between kb_2_(number) kb_people_(american_magazine) , where both participants attack , defend , and counter at kb_will_and_testament . in this respect kb_it resembles kb_judo `` kb_randori '' .in applying kb_a technique during kb_military_education_and_training , kb_it is the responsibility of `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' to prevent kb_injury to `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' by employing kb_a speed and kb_force of kb_application_(computing) that is commensurate with their partner 's proficiency in `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' . kb_injuries ( especially those to the joints ) , when they do occur in aikido , are often the result of `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' misjudging the ability of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' to receive the kb_throw_(grappling) or pin .kb_a kb_science of kb_injuries in the kb_martial_arts kb_arts showed that the kb_type_(biology) of kb_injuries varied considerably from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_art to the kb_other_(philosophy) .kb_hardness kb_tissue_(biology) kb_injuries are kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the most common types of kb_injuries found within aikido , as kb_water_well as joint kb_strain_(biology) and stubbed fingers and toes . several kb_maternal_death from head-and-neck kb_injuries , caused by aggressive `` shihōnage '' in kb_a kb_senpai_and_kōhaiaikido practitioners ( commonly called `` aikidōka '' outside kb_japan ) generally progress by promotion through kb_a series of `` kb_grade_(education) '' ( `` kb_kyū '' ) , followed by kb_a series of `` kb_degree_(angle) '' ( `` kb_dan_(rank) '' ) , pursuant to formal testing procedures . some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners ' kb_grade_(education) , often simply kb_white_american and kb_black_belt_(martial_arts) to distinguish `` kyu '' and `` kb_dan_(rank) '' kb_grade_(education) , though some use various belt colors . testing kb_requirement_analysis vary , kb_sulfate kb_a kb_particular rank in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another . some dojos do not allow students to kb_take the test to obtain kb_a `` kb_dan_(rank) '' rank unless they are 16 or older .the uniform worn for practicing aikido ( `` kb_aikidogi '' ) is similar to the kb_military_education_and_training uniform ( `` kb_keikogi '' ) used in most kb_other_(philosophy) kb_modern_history kb_martial_arts kb_arts ; kb_simple_polygon trousers and kb_a wraparound jacket , usually kb_white_american . both thick ( `` judo-style '' ) , and thin ( `` karate-style '' ) kb_cotton tops are used . aikido-specific tops are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance with shorter sleeves which reach to just kb_#ecclesiastical_history the kb_elbow_river .most aikido kb_systems_analysis add kb_a pair of wide pleated kb_black_sea or kb_indigo trousers called kb_a `` kb_hakama '' ( used also in kb_naginatajutsu , kb_kendo , and kb_iaido ) . in many schools , its use is reserved for practitioners with ( `` kb_dan_(rank) '' ) ranks or for instructors , while others allow all practitioners to wear kb_a `` kb_hakama '' regardless of rank .the most common criticism of aikido is that kb_it suffers from kb_a lack of kb_metaphysical_realism in kb_military_education_and_training . the attacks initiated by `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' ( and which `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' must defend against ) have been criticized as kb_being `` weak '' , `` sloppy '' , and `` little more than caricatures of an attack '' .weak attacks from `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' allow for kb_a conditioned response from `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners . to counteract this , some kb_art_movement allow students to become less compliant over kb_time_(magazine) but , in keeping with the core philosophies , this is after having demonstrated proficiency in kb_being able to protect themselves and their kb_military_education_and_training partners . kb_shodokan_aikido aikido addresses the issue by practising in kb_a competitive kb_text_formatting . such adaptations are debated between kb_art_movement , with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified , or that they are not kb_military_education_and_training for self-defense or kb_combat_(newspaper) effectiveness , but kb_spirituality , kb_fitness_(biology) or kb_other_(philosophy) reasons .another criticism pertains to the kb_shift_code in kb_military_education_and_training focus after the end of ueshiba 's seclusion in iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s , as kb_he_(letter) increasingly emphasized the kb_spirituality and kb_philosophy aspects of aikido . as kb_a result , strikes to kb_pressure_point points by `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , entering ( `` kb_irimi '' ) and initiation of techniques by `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , the distinction between `` omote '' ( front side ) and `` ura '' ( back side ) techniques , and the use of weapons , were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice . some aikido practitioners kb_sentience that lack of kb_military_education_and_training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness .conversely , some kb_art_movement of aikido receive criticism for not placing enough importance on the kb_spirituality practices emphasized by ueshiba . according to minoru shibata of aikido kb_academic_journal , `` o-sensei 's aikido was not kb_a continuation and kb_extension_(kinesiology) of the kb_old_testament and has kb_a distinct discontinuity with kb_past martial and kb_philosophy concepts . '' that is , that aikido practitioners kb_world_health_organization focus on aikido 's kb_semitic_root in traditional `` kb_jujutsu '' or `` kb_kenjutsucategory : kb_japanese_film kb_martial_arts kb_artscategory : dōcategory : kb_article_(grammar) containing kb_video kb_clips_(software)kb_art is kb_a diverse range of kb_human_behavior in creating visual , auditory or performing kb_artifact_(archaeology) ( kb_artworks ) , expressing the author 's kb_imagination , kb_concept kb_idea , or technical skill , kb_intention to kb_beryllium appreciated for their kb_beauty or emotional kb_power_(physics) . in their most kb_general_(united_states) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism these activities include the production of works of kb_art , the criticism of kb_art , the kb_science of the kb_history of kb_art , and the kb_aesthetic dissemination of kb_art .the kb_triliteral kb_classical_conditioning kb_branches_of_science of kb_art are kb_painting , kb_sculpture and kb_architecture . kb_music , kb_theatre , kb_film , kb_dance , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_performing_arts kb_arts , as kb_water_well as kb_ancient_egyptian_literature and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_medes such as kb_interactive_media kb_medes , are included in kb_a broader kb_definition of kb_the_arts kb_arts . until the 17th century , `` kb_art '' referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or kb_sciences . in kb_modern_history usage after the 17th century , where kb_aesthetic considerations are paramount , the kb_fine_(penalty) kb_arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in kb_general_(united_states) , such as the kb_decorative_art or kb_applied_arts .though the kb_definition of what constitutes kb_art is disputed and has changed over kb_time_(magazine) , kb_general_(united_states) descriptions mention an idea of kb_imagination or technical skill stemming from kb_agency_(philosophy) and creation . the kb_nature of kb_art and related concepts , such as creativity and kb_interpretation_(logic) , are explored in kb_a branch of kb_philosophy known as kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics .in the perspective of the kb_history of kb_art , artistic works have existed for almost as kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) as humankind : from early kb_pre-historic_art kb_art to contemporary kb_art ; however , some kb_theories restrict the kb_concept of `` artistic works '' to kb_modern_history kb_western_esotericism kb_society . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) early kb_word_sense of the kb_definition of `` kb_art '' is closely related to the older kb_latin kb_meaning_(linguistics) , which roughly translates to `` skill '' or `` kb_craft , '' as associated with kb_lexical_semantics such as `` kb_artisan . '' kb_australian_english kb_lexical_semantics kb_derived_trait from this kb_meaning_(linguistics) include `` artifact '' , `` artificial '' , `` artifice '' , `` kb_medical_abortion kb_arts '' , and `` kb_military kb_arts '' . however , there are many kb_other_(philosophy) colloquial uses of kb_the_word_(free_love) word , all with some relation to its kb_etymologyover kb_time_(magazine) , kb_philosopher like kb_plato , kb_aristotle , kb_socrates and kb_immanuel_kant , among others , questioned the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of kb_art . several dialogues in kb_plato tackle questions about kb_art : kb_socrates says that kb_poetry is inspired by the kb_muses , and is not kb_rational_number . kb_he_(letter) speaks approvingly of this , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_theory_of_forms of kb_divinity madness ( drunkenness , eroticism , and dreaming ) in the `` kb_phaedrus_(plato) `` ( 265a–c ) , and yet in the `` '' kb_republic '' '' wants to kb_outlaw kb_homer 's great kb_poetic_edda kb_art , and laughter as kb_water_well . in `` kb_ion '' , kb_socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of kb_homer that kb_he_(letter) expresses in the `` kb_republic '' . the kb_dialogue `` kb_ion '' suggests that kb_homer 's `` kb_iliad '' functioned in the kb_ancient_greek kb_world_war_ii as the kb_bible does today in the kb_modern_history kb_christianity kb_world_war_ii : as divinely inspired literary kb_art that can provide kb_morality guidance , if only kb_it can kb_beryllium properly interpreted .with regards to the literary kb_art and the musical kb_arts , kb_aristotle considered kb_epic_poetry , tragedy , comedy , kb_dithyramb kb_poetry and kb_music to kb_beryllium kb_mimesis or imitative kb_art , each varying in imitation by kb_list_of_art_mediums , kb_space_debris , and manner . for example , kb_music imitates with the kb_medes of kb_rhythm and kb_harmony , whereas kb_dance imitates with kb_rhythm alone , and kb_poetry with kb_hunnic_language . the kb_theory_of_forms also differ in their kb_space_debris of imitation . comedy , for instance , is kb_a dramatic imitation of men worse than average ; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average . lastly , the kb_theory_of_forms differ in their manner of imitation—through kb_narrative or kb_character_(computing) , through change or no change , and through drama or no drama . kb_aristotle believed that imitation is kb_natural_number to mankind and constitutes kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of mankind 's advantages over kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing .the kb_second_language , and more recent , kb_word_sense of kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_art '' as an abbreviation for `` kb_creativity kb_art '' or `` kb_fine_art '' kb_declaration_of_independence_of_albania in the early 17th century . kb_fine_art refers to kb_a skill used to express the kb_artist 's creativity , or to engage the audience 's kb_aesthetic sensibilities , or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or `` finer '' kb_cold_working of kb_art .within this latter kb_word_sense , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_art '' may refer to several things : ( kb_iodine ) kb_a kb_science of kb_a kb_creativity skill , ( ii ) kb_a process of using the kb_creativity skill , ( iii ) kb_a kb_decay_product of the kb_creativity skill , or ( iv ) the audience 's experience with the kb_creativity skill . the kb_creativity kb_arts ( `` kb_art '' as discipline ) are kb_a kb_class_(set_theory) of disciplines which produce `` kb_artworks '' ( `` kb_art '' as kb_object_relations_theory ) that are compelled by kb_a kb_personal_property drive ( kb_art as activity ) and convey kb_a message , mood , or kb_symbolism_(arts) for the perceiver to interpret ( kb_art as experience ) . kb_art is something that stimulates an kb_individual 's thoughts , emotions , kb_orthodoxy , or kb_idea through the senses . works of kb_art can kb_beryllium explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of images or kb_object_relations_theory . for some scholars , such as kb_immanuel_kant , the kb_sciences and kb_the_arts kb_arts could kb_beryllium distinguished by taking kb_science as representing the domain of kb_knowledge_representation and kb_the_arts kb_arts as representing the domain of the kb_freedom of artistic expression .often , if the skill is kb_being used in kb_a common or practical way , kb_people_(american_magazine) kb_will_and_testament consider kb_it kb_a kb_craft instead of kb_art . likewise , if the skill is kb_being used in kb_a commercial or industrial way , kb_it may kb_beryllium considered kb_commercial_art kb_art instead of kb_fine_art . on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , crafts and design are sometimes considered kb_applied_art . some kb_art followers have argued that the difference between kb_fine_art and kb_applied_art has more to do with kb_lightness judgments made about the kb_art than any clear definitional difference . however , even kb_fine_art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression . the purpose of works of kb_art may kb_beryllium to communicate kb_idea , such as in kb_politics_of_albania , spiritually , or philosophically motivated kb_art ; to create kb_a kb_word_sense of kb_beauty ( kb_episcopal_see kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics ) ; to explore the kb_nature of kb_machine_perception ; for kb_pleasure ; or to generate kb_strong_nuclear_force emotions . the purpose may also kb_beryllium seemingly nonexistent .the kb_nature of kb_art has been described by kb_philosophy kb_richard_wollheim wollheim as `` kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the most elusive of the traditional kb_problems_(aristotle) of kb_human kb_albanian_culture '' . kb_art has been kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as kb_a kb_space_vehicle for the expression or kb_communication of emotions and kb_idea , kb_a means for kb_exploring and appreciating kb_formalism_(art) kb_chemical_element for their own sake , and as `` kb_mimesis '' or kb_representation_(arts) . kb_art as kb_mimesis has deep kb_semitic_root in the kb_philosophy of kb_aristotle . kb_leo_tolstoy tolstoy kb_interpretatio_graeca kb_art as kb_a use of indirect means to communicate from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_person to another . kb_benedetto_croce croce and r.g . collingwood advanced the kb_idealism view that kb_art expresses emotions , and that the kb_cold_working of kb_art therefore essentially exists in the kb_mind of the creator . the kb_theory of kb_art as kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism has its kb_semitic_root in the kb_philosophy of kb_immanuel_kant , and was kb_adaptation in the early twentieth century by kb_roger_fry fry and kb_clive_bell kb_bell . more recently , thinkers influenced by kb_martin_heidegger heidegger have interpreted kb_art as the means by which kb_a kb_community develops for itself kb_a kb_list_of_art_mediums for self-expression and kb_interpretation_(logic) . kb_george_dickie_(philosopher) has offered an kb_institutional_theory_of_art kb_theory of kb_art that defines kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art as any artifact upon which kb_a qualified kb_grammatical_person or persons acting on behalf of the kb_social_anarchism institution commonly referred to as `` the kb_art_world '' has conferred `` the status of candidate for appreciation '' . larry shiner has described kb_fine_art as `` not an kb_essence or kb_a fate but something we have made . kb_art as we have generally understood kb_it is kb_a kb_european_eel invention barely kb_2_(number) hundred years kb_old_testament .

civilizations , more of their kb_art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to kb_other_(philosophy) cultures and later times . some also have provided the kb_first_trimester kb_record_(computer_science) of how artists worked . for example , this period of kb_ancient_greek kb_art saw kb_a veneration of the kb_human kb_health kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism and the development of kb_cognate skills to show musculature , poise , kb_beauty , and anatomically correct proportions .in kb_byzantine_empire and kb_medieval_greek kb_art of the kb_western_esotericism kb_middle_ages ages , much kb_art focused on the expression of kb_british_subject about kb_biblical and kb_religion kb_albanian_culture , and used kb_art_movement that showed the higher kb_glory_(religion) of kb_a heavenly kb_world_war_ii , such as the use of kb_gold in the background of paintings , or kb_glass in mosaics or kb_microsoft_windows , which also presented figures in idealized , patterned ( flat ) kb_theory_of_forms . nevertheless , kb_a kb_classical_conditioning kb_mathematical_realism kb_tradition persisted in small kb_byzantine_empire works , and kb_metaphysical_realism steadily grew in the kb_art of kb_catholic_europe .kb_renaissance kb_art had kb_a greatly increased kb_emphasis_(typography) on the realistic depiction of the kb_material kb_world_war_ii , and the kb_place_of_articulation of humans in kb_it , reflected in the corporeality of the kb_human_body , and development of kb_a kb_iupac_nomenclature method of kb_graphical_perspective perspectivein the kb_east_africa , islamic kb_art 's rejection of kb_iconography kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_emphasis_(typography) on kb_islamic_geometric_patterns , kb_calligraphy , and kb_architecture . further kb_east_africa , kb_religion dominated artistic kb_art_movement and kb_theory_of_forms too . kb_indian_subcontinent and tibet saw kb_emphasis_(typography) on painted sculptures and kb_dance , while kb_religion kb_painting kb_loanword many conventions from kb_sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with

kb_terracotta_army of kb_byzantine_emperors qin ) , kb_poetry , kb_calligraphy , kb_music , kb_painting , drama , kb_artificial_intelligence_in_fiction , etc . kb_chinese_characters kb_art_movement

paintings are monochromatic and sparse , emphasizing idealized landscapes , but kb_ming_dynasty kb_dynasty paintings are busy and colorful , and focus on telling stories via setting and kb_function_composition . kb_japan names its kb_art_movement after kb_ottoman_empire dynasties too , and also saw much interplay between the kb_art_movement of kb_calligraphy and kb_painting . kb_woodblock_printing printingthe kb_western_esotericism kb_age_of_enlightenment of kb_age_of_enlightenment in the kb_18th_century century saw artistic depictions of kb_health and kb_rational_number certainties of the clockwork kb_universe , as kb_water_well as kb_politics_of_albania revolutionary visions of kb_a post-monarchist kb_world_war_ii , such as kb_william_blake 's portrayal of

of the emotional side and individuality of humans , exemplified in the kb_novels of kb_goethe . the late kb_rilindja_kombëtare century then saw kb_a host of artistic movements , such as kb_academic_art kb_art , kb_symbolism_(arts) , kb_impressionism and kb_fauvism among others .the kb_history of twentieth-century kb_art is kb_a kb_narrative of endless possibilities and the search for kb_new_world kb_corporate_social_responsibility , each kb_being torn down in succession by the kb_next . thus the parameters of kb_impressionism , kb_expressionism , kb_fauvism , kb_cubism ,

kb_renaissance draftsmanship ) had an immense influence on kb_impressionism and subsequent development . later , kb_african_art were taken up by picasso and to some extent by kb_matisse . similarly , in the 19th and 20th kb_century_(cricket) the kb_western_culture has had huge impacts on kb_eastern_hemisphere kb_art with originally kb_western_esotericism kb_idea like kb_communism and kb_post-modernism exerting kb_a powerful influence .kb_modernism , the idealistic search for kb_truth , gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to kb_a realization of its unattainability . kb_theodor_w._adorno w. adorno said in 1970 , `` kb_it is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns kb_art can kb_beryllium taken for granted any more : neither kb_art itself , nor kb_art in

'' kb_relativism was kb_acceptance#self_acceptance as an unavoidable kb_truth , which kb_light-emitting_diode to the period of contemporary kb_art and kb_list_of_postmodern_critics criticism , where

furthermore , the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue kb_it is now more appropriate to think in terms of kb_a kb_globalization kb_albanian_culture , rather than of kb_regional_power ones .in `` kb_the_origin_of_the_work_of_art kb_evolution of the kb_cold_working of kb_art '' , kb_martin_heidegger heideggerthe kb_creativity kb_arts are often divided into more specific categories , typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as kb_medes , kb_genre , kb_art_movement , and kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . kb_art kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism refers to the kb_elements_of_art kb_art that are independent of its kb_interpretation_(logic) or kb_importance . kb_it kb_cover_version the methods kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by the kb_artist and the kb_health kb_function_composition of the artwork , primarily non-semantic aspects of the kb_cold_working ( i.e. , kb_figurae ) , such as kb_color , kb_contour_drawing , kb_dimension , kb_list_of_art_mediums , kb_melody , kb_space , kb_texture_(painting) , and kb_lightness . kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism may also include kb_visual_design_elements_and_principles#principles_of_design design principles , such as arrangement , kb_formal_balance , kb_contrast_(vision) , kb_emphasis_(typography) , kb_harmony , kb_hierarchical_proportion , kb_principles_of_grouping , and kb_rhythm .in kb_general_(united_states) there are kb_triliteral schools of kb_philosophy regarding kb_art , focusing respectively on kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , content , and kb_context_(language_use) . extreme kb_formalism_(art) is the view that all kb_aesthetic kb_chemical_property of kb_art are formal ( that is , part of the kb_art kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism ) . kb_philosopher almost kb_universal_reconciliation reject this view and hold that the kb_chemical_property and kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics of kb_art extend beyond materials , techniques , and kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . unfortunately , there is little consensus on terminology for these informal kb_chemical_property . some authors refer to kb_grammatical_subject kb_matter and content – i.e. , denotations and connotations – while others prefer terms like kb_meaning_(linguistics) and kb_importance .extreme intentionalism holds that kb_authorial_intent intent kb_play_(theatre) kb_a decisive role in the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art , conveying the content or kb_essential_element main idea , while all kb_other_(philosophy) interpretations can kb_beryllium discarded . kb_it defines the kb_grammatical_subject as the persons or idea represented , and the content as the kb_artist 's experience of that kb_grammatical_subject . for example , the kb_function_composition of kb_napoleon_i_on_his_imperial_throne on kb_histidine kb_ottoman_empire throne is partly kb_loanword from the kb_statue_of_zeus_at_olympia kb_zeus at kb_olympia_(manet) . as evidenced by the kb_title , the kb_grammatical_subject is kb_napoleon , and the content is kb_jean-auguste-dominique_ingres 's kb_representation_(arts) of kb_napoleon as `` emperor-god beyond kb_time_(magazine) and kb_space '' . similarly to extreme kb_formalism_(art) , kb_philosopher typically reject extreme intentionalism , because kb_art may have kb_cross-platform_software ambiguous meanings and kb_authorial_intent intent may kb_beryllium kb_uncertainty and thus irrelevant . its restrictive kb_interpretation_(logic) is `` socially unhealthy , philosophically unreal , and kb_politics_of_albania unwise '' .finally , the developing kb_theory of kb_post-structuralism studies kb_art 's kb_importance in kb_a kb_cultural_anthropology kb_context_(language_use) , such as the kb_idea , emotions , and reactions prompted by kb_a kb_cold_working . the kb_cultural_anthropology kb_context_(language_use) often kb_redox to the kb_artist 's techniques and intentions , in which case kb_analysis proceeds along lines similar to kb_formalism_(art) and intentionalism . however , in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_noun_case historical and kb_material conditions may predominate , such as kb_religion and kb_philosophy convictions , sociopolitical and kb_economic_anthropology kb_structural_analysis , or even kb_climate_of_albania and kb_geography . kb_art_criticismkb_art can connote kb_a kb_word_sense of trained ability or mastery of kb_a kb_list_of_art_mediums . kb_art can also simply refer to the kb_adaptation and efficient use of kb_a kb_hunnic_language `` kb_art '' , kb_particular in its elevated kb_word_sense , requires kb_a certain level of kb_creativity expertise by the kb_artist , whether this kb_beryllium kb_a demonstration of technical ability , an originality in stylistic approach , or kb_a combination of these kb_2_(number) . traditionally skill of execution was viewed as kb_a quality inseparable from kb_art and thus necessary for its success ; for kb_leonardo_da_vinci da vinci , kb_art , neither more nor less than kb_histidine kb_other_(philosophy) endeavors , was kb_a manifestation of skill . kb_rembrandt 's kb_cold_working , now praised for its ephemeral virtues , was most admired by kb_histidine contemporaries for its virtuosity . at the kb_turn_(geometry) of the 20th century , the adroit performances of kb_john_singer_sargent sargent were alternately admired and viewed with kb_skepticism for their kb_manual_(music) kb_fluency , yet at nearly the same kb_time_(magazine) the kb_artist kb_world_health_organization would become the era 's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast , kb_pablo_picasso picassokb_a common contemporary criticism of some kb_modern_art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic kb_space_debris . in kb_conceptual_art , kb_marcel_duchamp kb_duchamp 's `` kb_fountain_(duchamp) '' is among the kb_first_trimester examples of pieces wherein the kb_artist used kb_found_art kb_object_relations_theory ( `` ready-made '' ) and exercised no traditionally recognised kb_set_(mythology) of skills . kb_tracey_emin kb_tracey_emin 's `` my bed '' , or kb_damien_hirst kb_damien_hirstsince kb_history_of_abortion , much of the finest kb_art has represented kb_a deliberate kb_computer_monitor of wealth or kb_power_(physics) , often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials . much kb_art has been commissioned by kb_politics rulers or kb_religion establishments , with more modest versions only kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance to the most wealthy in society .nevertheless , there have been many periods where kb_art of very kb_high_middle_ages quality was kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance , in terms of kb_ownership , across kb_prespa_lake parts of society , above all in cheap kb_medes such as kb_ancient_egyptian_pottery , which persists in the ground , and perishable kb_medes such as kb_textile_industry and kb_wood . in many different cultures , the kb_ceramics_of_indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas of kb_indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas of the kb_americas are found in such kb_a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to kb_a kb_social_elite , though kb_other_(philosophy) kb_theory_of_forms of kb_art may have been . reproductive methods such as kb_molding_(process) made mass-production easier , and were used to bring high-quality kb_ancient_roman_pottery kb_ancient_egyptian_pottery and kb_ancient_greek tanagra figurines to kb_a very wide market . kb_cylinder_seals were both artistic and practical , and very widely used by what can kb_beryllium loosely called the middle kb_class_(biology) in the kb_ancient_near_east kb_east_africa . once kb_ancient_roman_coinage were widely used , these also became an kb_art kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism that reached the widest range of society .another important kb_list_of_azerbaijani_inventions_and_discoveries came in the 15th century in kb_europe , when kb_printmaking began with small woodcuts , mostly kb_religion , that were often very small and hand-colored , and affordable even by peasants kb_world_health_organization glued them to the walls of their homes . printed books were initially very expensive , but fell steadily in kb_price until by the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations . kb_popular_prints prints of many different sorts have decorated homes and kb_other_(philosophy) places for kb_century_(cricket) .kb_public_art and monuments , kb_secular and kb_religion , by their kb_nature normally address the whole of society , and visitors as viewers , and kb_computer_monitor to the kb_general_(united_states) kb_state_school has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) been an important kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors in their design . kb_egyptian_temples are typical in that the most kb_largest_organisms and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could kb_beryllium seen by the kb_general_(united_states) kb_state_school , rather than the areas seen only by the kb_priests . many areas of royal palaces , castles and the houses of the kb_social_elite were often generally accessible , and kb_prespa_lake parts of the kb_art collections of such kb_people_(american_magazine) could often kb_beryllium seen , either by anybody , or by those able to pay kb_a small kb_price , or those wearing the correct clothes , regardless of kb_world_health_organization they were , as at the kb_palace_of_versailles of versailles , where the appropriate kb_extra_(australian_tv_channel) accessories ( kb_silver shoe buckles and kb_a kb_sword ) could kb_beryllium hired from shops outside .special arrangements were made to allow the kb_state_school to kb_episcopal_see many royal or kb_private_aviation collections placed in kb_art_gallery , as with the kb_orleans_collection#collection_in_paris kb_class_(set_theory) mostly housed in kb_a kb_wing of the kb_palais_royal royal in kb_paris , which could kb_beryllium visited for most of the kb_18th_century century . in kb_italy the kb_art kb_tourism_in_angola of the kb_grand_tour tour became kb_a kb_major_(united_states) kb_industry from the kb_renaissance onwards , and governments and cities made efforts to make their kb_key_(cryptography) works accessible . the kb_kingdom_of_great_britain kb_royal_collection kb_class_(set_theory) remains distinct , but kb_prespa_lake donations such as the kb_old_royal_library library were made from kb_it to kb_british_museum kb_british_museum , established in 1753. the kb_uffizi in kb_florence opened entirely as kb_a gallery in 1765 , though this kb_function_(biology) had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants ' offices for kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_time_(magazine) before . the building now kb_dutch_loango-angola by the kb_prado in kb_madrid was built before the kb_french_revolution for the kb_state_school kb_computer_monitor of parts of the royal kb_art kb_class_(set_theory) , and similar royal kb_art_gallery kb_open_standard to the kb_state_school existed in kb_vienna , kb_munich and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_capital_(architecture) . the opening of the kb_musée_du_louvre du louvre during the kb_french_revolution ( in 1793 ) as kb_a kb_state_school kb_museum for much of the former kb_france kb_royal_collection kb_class_(set_theory) certainly marked an important stage in the development of kb_state_school access to kb_art , transferring kb_ownership to kb_a kb_roman_republic kb_state_of_matter , but was kb_a continuation of trends already kb_water_well established .most kb_modern_history kb_state_school museums and kb_visual_arts_education programs for children in schools can kb_beryllium traced back to this impulse to have kb_art kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance to everyone . museums in the united kb_sovereign_state tend to kb_beryllium gifts from the very rich to the masses . ( kb_the_metropolitan_museum_of_art kb_metropolitan_museum_of_art of kb_art in kb_new_york_city , for example , was created by kb_john_taylor_johnston johnstonthere have been attempts by artists to create kb_art that can not kb_beryllium bought by the wealthy as kb_a status kb_space_debris . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_prime_(symbol) original motivators of much of the kb_art of the late kb_1960s_in_the_united_states and 1970s was to create kb_art that could not kb_beryllium bought and sold . kb_it is `` necessary to present something more than mere kb_object_relations_theory '' said the kb_major_(united_states) post kb_war kb_german_language kb_artist joseph beuys . this kb_time_(magazine) period saw the rise of such things as kb_performance_art kb_art , kb_video_art , and kb_conceptual_artkb_art has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) been controversial , that is to say disliked by some viewers , for kb_a wide kb_variety_(magazine) of reasons , though most pre-modern kb_controversies_in_autism are dimly recorded , or completely kb_lost_film to kb_a kb_modern_history view . kb_iconoclasm is the destruction of kb_art that is disliked for kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of reasons , including kb_religion ones . kb_aniconism is kb_a kb_general_(united_states) dislike of either all figurative images , or often just kb_religion ones , and has been kb_a thread in many kb_major_religious_groups . kb_it has been kb_a crucial kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors in the kb_history of islamic kb_art , where kb_depictions_of_muhammad of kb_muhammad remain especially controversial . much kb_art has been disliked purely because kb_it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers , parties or kb_other_(philosophy) kb_group_(mathematics) . artistic conventions have often been kb_conservative and taken very seriously by kb_art kb_art_critic , though often much less kb_sulfate by kb_a wider kb_state_school . the kb_iconography content of kb_art could cause kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war , as with late kb_medieval_greek depictions of the kb_new_world kb_motif_(visual_arts) of the kb_swoon_of_the_virgin of the virgin in scenes of the kb_crucifixion_of_jesus of kb_jesus . the `` last kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition '' by kb_michelangelo was controversial for various reasons , including breaches of kb_decorum through nudity and the apollo-like pose of kb_jesus_christ .the content of much formal kb_art through kb_history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the kb_artist , but with the kb_advent of kb_romanticism , and kb_economic_anthropology changes in the production of kb_art , the artists ' kb_computer_vision became the usual kb_determinant of the content of kb_histidine kb_art , increasing the incidence of kb_controversies_in_autism , though often kb_redox their kb_importance . kb_strong_nuclear_force incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to kb_court kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war . kb_théodore_géricault géricault 's `` kb_the_raft_of_the_medusa of the kb_medusa '' ( kb_circa 1820 ) , was in part kb_a kb_politics commentary on kb_a recent event . kb_édouard_manet manet 's `` kb_the_luncheon_on_the_grass déjeuner sur l'herbe '' ( 1863 ) , was considered scandalous not because of the kb_nude woman , but because she is seated kb_next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the kb_time_(magazine) , rather than in robes of the antique kb_world_war_ii . kb_john_singer_sargent sargent 's `` madame pierre gautreau ( madam x ) '' ( 1884 ) , caused kb_a kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war over the reddish pink used to kb_color the woman 's kb_ear lobe , considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high-society kb_rutherford_model 's reputation .the gradual abandonment of kb_realism_(arts) and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual kb_appearance_(philosophy) of kb_british_subject in the 19th and 20th kb_century_(cricket) kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_a rolling kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war lasting for over kb_a century . in the twentieth century , kb_pablo_picasso picasso 's `` kb_guernica_(painting) '' ( 1937 ) used arresting kb_cubism techniques and stark kb_monochrome_painting kb_cooking_oil , to depict the harrowing consequences of kb_a contemporary bombing of kb_a small , kb_ancient_history kb_basque_language town . kb_leon_golub golub 's `` interrogation iii '' ( 1981 ) , depicts kb_a female kb_nude , hooded detainee strapped to kb_a chair , her kb_human_leg kb_open_standard to reveal her sexual kb_organ_(anatomy) , surrounded by kb_2_(number) tormentors dressed in everyday clothing . kb_andres_serrano serrano 's `` kb_piss_christ kb_jesus_christ '' ( 1989 ) is kb_a photograph of kb_a crucifix , kb_sacred_architecture to the kb_christianity kb_religion and representing kb_jesus_christ 's kb_sacrifice and final suffering , submerged in kb_a kb_glass of the kb_artist 's own urine . the resulting uproar kb_light-emitting_diode to comments in the kb_united_states_senate kb_sovereign_state kb_united_states_senate about kb_state_school funding of kb_the_arts kb_arts .before kb_modernism , kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics in kb_art_of_europe was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate kb_formal_balance between different aspects of kb_realism_(arts) kb_truth to kb_nature and the kb_ideal_(ring_theory) ; kb_idea as to what the appropriate kb_formal_balance is have shifted to and fro over the kb_century_(cricket) . this concern is largely absent in kb_other_(philosophy) traditions of kb_art . the kb_aesthetic theorist kb_john_ruskin , kb_world_health_organization championed what kb_he_(letter) saw as the kb_realism_(arts) of j. m. w. kb_j._m._w._turner , saw kb_art 's role as the kb_communication by artifice of an kb_essential_element kb_truth that could only kb_beryllium found in kb_nature .the kb_definition and evaluation of kb_art has become especially problematic since the 20th century . kb_richard_wollheim wollheim distinguishes kb_triliteral approaches to assessing the kb_aesthetic kb_lightness of kb_art : the kb_mathematical_realism , whereby kb_aesthetic quality is an kb_absolute_value independent of any kb_human view ; the kb_objectivity_(philosophy) , whereby kb_it is also an kb_absolute_value , but is dependent on kb_general_(united_states) kb_human experience ; and the kb_relativist kb_positional_notationthe kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_modernism in the late nineteenth century kb_lead to kb_a kb_political_radicalism break in the kb_human_fertilization of the kb_function_(biology) of kb_art , and then again in the late twentieth century with the kb_advent of kb_postmodern_art . kb_clement_greenberg greenberg 's kb_u.s._presidential_election,_1960 article `` modernist kb_painting '' defines kb_modern_art as `` the use of kb_characteristic_(algebra) methods of kb_a discipline to criticize the discipline itself '' . greenberg originally kb_applied_science this idea to the abstract kb_german_expressionism kb_movement_(sign_language) and used kb_it as kb_a way to kb_natural_language_understanding and justify flat ( non-illusionistic ) abstract kb_painting :pop artists like kb_andy_warhol warhol became both noteworthy and influential through kb_cold_working including and possibly critiquing popular kb_albanian_culture , as kb_water_well as the kb_art_world . artists of the 1980s , 1990s , and kb_2000s_in_angola expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond `` kb_high_middle_ages kb_art '' to all kb_cultural_anthropology image-making , including fashion images , comics , billboards and pornography .kb_duchamp once kb_anatolian_hypothesis that kb_art is any activity of any kind- everything . however , the way that only certain activities are classified today as kb_art is kb_a kb_social_anarchism kb_construction . there is kb_evidence_(law) that there may kb_beryllium an kb_chemical_element of kb_truth to this . `` the invention of kb_art : kb_a kb_cultural_anthropology kb_history '' is an kb_art_history book which examines the kb_construction of the kb_modern_history system of kb_the_arts kb_arts i.e . kb_fine_art . shiner finds kb_evidence_(law) that the older system of kb_the_arts kb_arts before our kb_modern_history system ( kb_fine_art ) held kb_art to kb_beryllium any skilled kb_human activity i.e . kb_ancient_greek society did not possess the kb_terminology kb_art but kb_techne . kb_techne can kb_beryllium understood neither as kb_art or kb_craft , the kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving kb_being that the kb_aspect_ratio_(image)#distinctions of kb_art and kb_craft are historical products that came later on in kb_human kb_history . kb_techne included kb_painting , sculpting and kb_music but also ; cooking , kb_medicine , kb_horsemanship , kb_geometry , kb_carpentry , kb_prophecy , and farming etc .following kb_duchamp during the kb_first_trimester half of the twentieth century , kb_a significant kb_shift_code to kb_general_(united_states) kb_aesthetic kb_theory took kb_place_of_articulation which attempted to apply kb_aesthetic kb_theory between various kb_theory_of_forms of kb_art , including the literary kb_arts and the kb_visual_arts kb_arts , to each kb_other_(philosophy) . this resulted in the rise of kb_the_new_criticism kb_new_criticism kb_school and kb_abortion_debate concerning `` kb_intentional_fallacy intentional fallacy '' . at issue was the kb_question of whether the kb_aesthetic intentions of the kb_artist in creating the kb_cold_working of kb_art , whatever its specific kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , should kb_beryllium associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final kb_decay_product of the kb_cold_working of kb_art , or , if the kb_cold_working of kb_art should kb_beryllium evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the kb_artist .in 1946 , kb_w._k._wimsatt k. wimsatt and kb_monroe_beardsley beardsley published kb_a classic and controversial kb_new_world critical essay entitled `` kb_intentional_fallacy intentional fallacy '' , in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author 's intention , or `` kb_intention kb_meaning_(linguistics) '' in the kb_analysis of kb_a literary kb_cold_working . for wimsatt and beardsley , the kb_lexical_semantics on the page were all that mattered ; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant , and potentially distracting .in another essay , `` kb_affective_fallacy affective fallacy , '' which served as kb_a kind of sister essay to `` kb_intentional_fallacy intentional fallacy '' wimsatt and beardsley also discounted the kb_reader_(academic_rank) 's personal/emotional reaction to kb_a literary kb_cold_working as kb_a valid means of analyzing kb_a text . this fallacy would later kb_beryllium repudiated by theorists from the kb_reader-response kb_school of literary kb_theory . ironically ,

kb_histidine essay `` kb_ancient_egyptian_literature in the kb_reader_(academic_rank) '' ( 1970 ) .as summarized by gaut and livingston in their essay `` the creation of kb_art '' : `` kb_structuralism and post-structuralists theorists and kb_art_critic were sharply critical of many aspects of kb_new_criticism , beginning with the kb_emphasis_(typography) on kb_aesthetic appreciation and the so-called kb_self-governance of kb_art , but they reiterated the attack on kb_biographical_film criticisms 's assumption that the kb_artist 's activities and experience were kb_a privileged critical kb_topic_(linguistics) . '' these authors contend that : `` anti-intentionalists , such as formalists , hold that the intentions involved in the making of kb_art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting kb_art . kb_sulfate details of the act of creating kb_a kb_cold_working , though possibly of kb_interest in themselves , have no bearing on the correct kb_interpretation_(logic) of the kb_cold_working . ''gaut and livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that : `` intentionalists , unlike formalists , hold that reference to intentions is kb_essential_element in fixing the correct kb_interpretation_(logic) of works . '' they quote kb_richard_wollheim wollheim as stating that , `` the task of criticism is the kb_reconstruction_era of the kb_creativity process , where the kb_creativity process must in kb_turn_(geometry) kb_beryllium thought of as something not stopping short of , but terminating on , the kb_cold_working of kb_art itself . ''the end of the 20th century fostered an extensive kb_abortion_debate known as the kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_turn_(geometry) kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war , or the `` innocent kb_human_eye kb_abortion_debate '' , and generally referred to as the structuralism-poststructuralism kb_abortion_debate in the kb_philosophy of kb_art . this kb_abortion_debate discussed the encounter of the kb_cold_working of kb_art as kb_being determined by the relative extent to which the kb_concept encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art .decisive for the kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_turn_(geometry) kb_abortion_debate in kb_art_history and the kb_humanities were the works of yet another kb_tradition , namely the kb_structuralism of kb_ferdinand_de_saussure kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann saussure and the ensuing kb_movement_(sign_language) of kb_poststructuralism . in 1981 , the kb_artist kb_mark_tansey created kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art titled `` the innocent kb_human_eye '' as kb_a criticism of the prevailing kb_climate_of_albania of disagreement in the kb_philosophy of kb_art during the closing decades of the 20th century . influential theorists include kb_judith_butler butler , kb_luce_irigaray irigaray , kb_julia_kristeva , kb_michel_foucault kb_léon_foucault and kb_jacques_derrida derrida . the kb_power_(physics) of kb_hunnic_language , more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes , in kb_art_history and historical kb_discourse was explored by kb_hayden_white kb_white_american . the kb_fact that kb_hunnic_language is `` not '' kb_a transparent kb_list_of_art_mediums of thought had been stressed by kb_a very different kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_philosophy_of_language kb_hunnic_language which originated in the works of kb_johann_georg_hamann georg hamann and kb_wilhelm_von_humboldt von humboldt . kb_ernst_gombrich gombrich and kb_nelson_goodman goodman in kb_histidine book `` languages of kb_art : an approach to kb_a kb_theory of kb_symbols '' came to hold that the kb_concept encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art during the kb_1960s_in_the_united_states and 1970s . kb_he_(letter) was challenged on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of kb_research done by the kb_nobel_prize prize winning psychologist kb_roger_sperry sperry kb_world_health_organization maintained that the kb_human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in kb_hunnic_language alone ( the kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_turn_(geometry) ) and that kb_other_(philosophy) kb_theory_of_forms of kb_psychology representations of the kb_cold_working of kb_art were equally defensible and demonstrable . sperry 's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with kb_aesthetic kb_philosopher such as kb_nick_zangwill zangwill disputes as to whether or not to classify something as kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art are referred to as classificatory disputes about kb_art . classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included kb_cubism and kb_impressionist paintings , kb_duchamp 's `` kb_fountain_(duchamp) '' , the movies , superlative imitations of kb_j._s._g._boggs , kb_conceptual_art , and kb_video_games . kb_philosophy kb_jacques-louis_david novitz has argued that disagreement about the kb_definition of kb_art are rarely the kb_heart of the problem . rather , `` the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their kb_social_anarchism kb_life_(magazine) '' are `` kb_sulfate much kb_a part of all classificatory disputes about kb_art '' ( novitz , 1996 ) . according to novitz , classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to kb_go_(game) than they are about kb_theory proper . for example , when the `` kb_daily_mail kb_airmail '' criticized kb_damien_hirst 's and kb_tracey_emin 's kb_cold_working by arguing `` for 1,000 years kb_art has been kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of our great civilising kb_afsharid_dynasty . today , pickled kb_sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) all '' they are not advancing kb_a kb_definition or kb_theory about kb_art , but questioning the kb_lightness of kb_damien_hirst 's and kb_tracey_emin 's kb_cold_working . in kb_1998_nrl_season , kb_arthur_danto , suggested kb_a kb_einstein's_thought_experiments kb_experiment showing that `` the status of an artifact as kb_cold_working of kb_art results from the kb_idea kb_a kb_albanian_culture applies to kb_it , rather than its inherent kb_health or perceptible qualities . kb_cultural_anthropology kb_interpretation_(logic) ( an kb_art kb_theory of some kind ) is therefore constitutive of an kb_space_debris 's arthood . ''kb_anti-art is kb_a label for kb_art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of kb_art ; kb_it is kb_terminology associated with kb_dadaism and attributed to

, `` kb_fountain_(duchamp) '' ( 1917 ) , an kb_ordinary_(officer) urinal , has achieved considerable kb_topographic_prominence and influence on kb_art . kb_anti-art is kb_a kb_i_shot_andy_warhol of

of skill of the deceiver is praised ) . kb_it is this use of kb_the_word_(free_love) word as kb_a kb_measure_(mathematics) of kb_high_middle_ages quality and kb_high_middle_ages kb_lightness that gives the kb_terminology its kb_flavor of subjectivity . making judgments of kb_lightness requires kb_a kb_basis_(linear_algebra) for criticism . at the simplest level , kb_a way to determine whether the impact of the kb_space_debris on the senses meets the criteria to kb_beryllium considered `` kb_art '' is whether kb_it is perceived to kb_beryllium attractive or repulsive . though kb_machine_perception is always colored by experience , and is necessarily subjective , kb_it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying can not kb_beryllium kb_art . however , `` good '' kb_art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to kb_a majority of viewers . in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_lexical_semantics , an kb_artist 's kb_prime_(symbol) kb_motivation need not kb_beryllium the pursuit of the kb_aesthetic . also , kb_art often depicts terrible images made for kb_social_anarchism , kb_morality , or thought-provoking reasons . for example , kb_francisco_goya goya 's kb_painting depicting the kb_spanish_empire shootings of 3rd of may 1808 is kb_a graphic depiction of kb_a firing squad executing several kb_pleading kb_civilian_casualties . yet at the same kb_time_(magazine) , the horrific kb_imagery demonstrates goya 's keen artistic ability in kb_function_composition and execution and produces fitting kb_social_anarchism and kb_politics outrage . thus , the kb_abortion_debate continues as to what kb_musical_mode of kb_aesthetic satisfaction , if any , is required to define 'art ' .the assumption of kb_new_world values or the rebellion against kb_acceptance#self_acceptance notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with kb_a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing . indeed , the kb_obverse_and_reverse is often kb_truth , that the revision of what is kb_folk_etymology conceived of as kb_being aesthetically appealing allows for kb_a re-invigoration of kb_aesthetic sensibility , and kb_a kb_new_world appreciation for the kb_corporate_social_responsibility of kb_art itself . countless schools have kb_anatolian_hypothesis their own ways to define quality , yet they all seem to agree in at least kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) point : once their kb_aesthetic choices are kb_acceptance#self_acceptance , the kb_lightness of the kb_cold_working of kb_art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen kb_list_of_art_mediums to kb_strike_action some kb_universal_studios chord by the rarity of the skill of the kb_artist or in its accurate kb_reflection_(physics) in what is termed the `` kb_zeitgeist '' . kb_art is often kb_intention to kb_appeal to and connect with kb_human kb_emotion . kb_it can arouse

kb_a kb_manual_(music) syringe , while `` electric kb_vacuum_aspiration '' ( eva ) uses an electric pump . these techniques differ in the kb_mechanism_(biology) used to apply suction , in how early in

in very early kb_pregnancy , and does not require kb_cervical_dilation . kb_dilation_and_curettage and kb_curettage ( d & kb_vitamin_c ) , the kb_second_language most common method of surgical kb_abortion , is kb_a standard gynecological procedure performed for kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of reasons , including kb_hypothesis of the uterine lining for possible malignancy , investigation of abnormal bleeding , and kb_abortion . kb_curettage refers to cleaning the walls of the kb_uterus with kb_a kb_curette . the kb_world_health_organization organization recommends this procedure , also called `` sharp kb_curettage , '' only when mva is unavailable .from the 15th kb_gestational_age of kb_gestation until approximately the 26th , kb_other_(philosophy) techniques must kb_beryllium used . kb_dilation_and_evacuation and evacuation ( d & e ) consists of opening the kb_cervix of the kb_uterus and emptying kb_it using surgical instruments and suction . after the 16th kb_gestational_age of kb_gestation , abortions can also kb_beryllium induced by kb_intact_dilation_and_extraction dilation and extraction ( idx ) ( also called intrauterine cranial decompression ) , which requires surgical decompression of the kb_fetus 's kb_human_head before evacuation . idx is sometimes called `` kb_partial-birth_abortion kb_abortion '' , which has been kb_partial-birth_abortion_ban_act

kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) and is performed under kb_general_anesthesia . kb_it requires kb_a smaller incision than kb_a kb_caesarean_section kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) and is used during later stages of kb_pregnancy .first-trimester procedures can generally kb_beryllium performed using kb_local_anesthesia anesthesia , while second-trimester methods may require

according to the kb_guttmacher_institute institute , providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38,000 fewer kb_maternal_death from kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion annually worldwide .the rate of kb_law , kb_#induced kb_abortion varies extensively worldwide . according to the report of employees of kb_guttmacher_institute institute kb_it ranged from 7 per 1000 women ( kb_germany and kb_switzerland ) to 30 per 1000 women ( kb_estonia ) in countries with complete kb_statistics in 2008. the kb_hierarchical_proportion of pregnancies that ended in kb_#induced kb_abortion ranged from about 10 % ( kb_israel , kb_netherlands kb_netherlands and kb_switzerland ) to 30 % ( kb_estonia ) in the same kb_group_(periodic_table) , though kb_it might kb_beryllium as kb_high_middle_ages as 36 % kb_hungarian_revolution_of_1919 kb_hungary and kb_romania , whose kb_statistics were deemed incomplete .an kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) kb_science in kb_2002_australian_open concluded that about half of women having abortions were using kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_birth_control at the kb_time_(magazine) of becoming kb_pregnant . inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms and three-quarters of those using the kb_combined_oral_contraceptive_pill pill ; 42 % of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage . the kb_guttmacher_institute institute estimated that `` most abortions in the united kb_sovereign_state are obtained by minority women '' because minority women `` have much higher kb_rates_(tax) of kb_unintended_pregnancy kb_pregnancy '' .the kb_abortion rate may also kb_beryllium expressed as the average kb_grammatical_number of abortions kb_a woman has during her reproductive years ; this is referred to as `` total kb_abortion rate '' ( kb_tar ) .kb_abortion kb_rates_(tax) also vary depending on the stage of kb_pregnancy and the method practiced . in 2003 , the kb_centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention for kb_disease control and prevention ( kb_centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention ) reported that 26 % of reported kb_law induced abortions in the united kb_sovereign_state were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks ' kb_gestation , kb_18-point_agreement % at 7 weeks , 15 % at kb_group_8_element weeks , kb_18-point_agreement % at 9 through 10 weeks , 10 % at 11 through 12 weeks , 6 % at kb_boron_group through 15 weeks , 4 % at 16 through 20 weeks and 1 % at more than 21 weeks . 91 % of these were classified as having been done by `` kb_curettage '' ( kb_suction-aspiration_abortion , kb_dilation_and_curettage and kb_curettage , kb_dilation_and_evacuation and evacuation ) , kb_group_8_element % by `` kb_medical_abortion '' means ( kb_mifepristone ) , > 1 % by `` kb_instillation_abortion instillation '' ( kb_saline_(medicine) or kb_prostaglandin ) , and 1 % by `` kb_other_(philosophy) '' ( including kb_hysterotomy_abortion and kb_hysterectomy ) . according to the kb_centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention , due to kb_big_data kb_class_(set_theory) difficulties the kb_big_data must kb_beryllium viewed as tentative and some fetal kb_maternal_death reported beyond 20 weeks may kb_beryllium kb_natural_number kb_maternal_death erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead kb_fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an kb_#induced kb_abortion .the kb_guttmacher_institute institute estimated there were 2,200 kb_intact_dilation_and_extraction dilation and extractionthe reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the kb_world_war_ii .some of the most common reasons are to postpone childbearing to kb_a more suitable kb_time_(magazine) or to focus energies and resources on existing children . others include kb_being unable to afford kb_a child either in terms of the direct costs of raising kb_a child or the loss of kb_income while caring for the child , lack of support from the kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , inability to afford additional children , desire to provide schooling for existing children , disruption of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's own kb_education_in_albania , relationship kb_problems_(aristotle) with their partner , kb_a kb_machine_perception of kb_being too kb_thomas_young_(scientist) to have kb_a child , kb_unemployment , and not kb_being willing to raise kb_a child conceived as kb_a result of kb_rape or kb_incest , among others .some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures . these might include the preference for children of kb_a specific sex or kb_race_(human_categorization) , disapproval of kb_single_bond or early motherhood , stigmatization of kb_people_with_disabilities disabilities , insufficient kb_economic_anthropology support for kb_family_(biology) , lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods , or efforts toward kb_population_control ( such as kb_china 's kb_one-child_policy policy ) . these factors can sometimes result in kb_compulsory_education kb_abortion or kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion .an additional kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors is kb_risk to maternal or fetal health , which was cited as the kb_primary_education kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving for kb_abortion in over kb_a kb_ipad_(third_generation) of kb_noun_case in some countries and as kb_a significant kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors in only kb_a single-digit percentage of abortions in kb_other_(philosophy) countries .in the kb_united_states_navy , the supreme kb_court decisions in `` kb_roe_v._wade kb_verb wade '' and `` kb_doe_v._bolton kb_verb bolton '' : `` ruled that the kb_state_of_matter 's kb_interest in the kb_life_(magazine) of the kb_fetus became compelling only at the point of kb_fetal_viability , kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as the point at which the kb_fetus can survive independently of its mother . even after the point of kb_fetal_viability , the kb_state_of_matter can not favor the kb_life_(magazine) of the kb_fetus over the kb_life_(magazine) or health of the kb_pregnant woman . under the kb_right-wing_politics of privacy , physicians must kb_beryllium free to use their `` kb_medical_abortion kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition for the preservation of the kb_life_(magazine) or health of kb_the_mother_(1934_novel) mother .

and kb_histidine pronouncement of 1588 was kb_turing_test#reverse_turing_test_and_captcha kb_triliteral years later by kb_histidine successor . through most of its kb_history the kb_catholic_church was divided on whether kb_it believed that kb_abortion was kb_murder , and kb_it did not begin vigorously opposing kb_abortion until the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century . in kb_fact , several historians have written that kb_prior to the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century most kb_catholic_church authors did not regard termination of kb_pregnancy before `` kb_quickening '' or `` ensoulment '' as an kb_abortion .kb_a kb_1995_davis_cup kb_survey_(statistics) reported that kb_catholic_church women are as likely as the kb_general_(united_states) kb_population to terminate kb_a kb_pregnancy , kb_protestantism are less likely to kb_women's_suffrage kb_sulfate , and kb_evangelical_christians are the least likely to kb_women's_suffrage kb_sulfate . kb_islam_and_abortion kb_tradition has traditionally permitted kb_abortion until kb_a point in kb_time_(magazine) when kb_islam kb_believe_(tv_series) the kb_soul enters the kb_fetus , considered by various theologians to kb_beryllium at kb_human_fertilization , 40 days after kb_human_fertilization , 120 days after kb_human_fertilization , or quickening. < ref name= '' kb_bbc and kb_islam / kb_abortion '' > < /ref > however , kb_abortion is largely heavily restricted or forbidden in areas of kb_high_middle_ages islamic kb_faith such as the kb_middle_east_and_north_africa and kb_north_africa .in kb_europe and kb_north_america , kb_abortion techniques advanced starting in the 17th century . however , conservatism by most physicians with regards to sexual matters prevented the wide expansion of safe kb_abortion techniques . kb_other_(philosophy) kb_medical_abortion practitioners in kb_addition to some physicians advertised their kb_service_(economics) , and they were not widely regulated until the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century , when the practice ( sometimes called `` restellism '' ) was banned in both the united kb_sovereign_state and the kb_united_kingdom kb_kingdom_(biology) . kb_church_(building) kb_group_(mathematics) as kb_water_well as physicians were highly influential in anti-abortion movements . in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , according to some sources , kb_abortion was more dangerous than childbirth until about 1930 when incremental improvements in kb_abortion procedures relative to childbirth made kb_abortion safer . however , kb_other_(philosophy) sources maintain that in the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century early abortions under the hygienic conditions in which kb_midwifery usually worked were relatively safe .in kb_addition , some commentators have written that , despite improved kb_medical_abortion procedures , the period from the 1930s until kb_edict_of_toleration_by_galerius also saw more zealous enforcement of anti-abortion laws , and concomitantly an increasing control of kb_abortion providers by organized crime .kb_russian_soviet_federative_socialist_republic ( 1919 ) , kb_iceland ( 1935 ) and kb_sweden ( kb_1938_in_literature ) were among the kb_first_trimester countries to legalize certain or all kb_theory_of_forms of kb_abortion . in 1935 kb_nazi_germany , kb_a kb_law was passed permitting abortions for those deemed `` hereditarily ill '' , while women considered of kb_german_language stock were specifically prohibited from having abortions . beginning in the kb_second_language half of the twentieth century , kb_abortion was legalized in kb_a greater kb_grammatical_number of countries .kb_#induced kb_abortion has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) been the source of considerable kb_abortion_debate . kb_ethics , kb_morality , kb_philosophy , kb_biology , kb_religion and kb_law issues surrounding kb_abortion are related to kb_lightness kb_systems_analysis . opinions of kb_abortion may kb_beryllium about kb_fetal_rights kb_catalan_constitutions , governmental kb_authority , and women 's kb_catalan_constitutions .in both kb_state_school and kb_private_aviation kb_abortion_debate , arguments presented in favor of or against kb_abortion access focus on either the kb_morality permissibility of an kb_#induced kb_abortion , or kb_justification_(theology) of laws permitting or restricting kb_abortion . the kb_world_medical_association kb_continental_association kb_united_states_declaration_of_independence on therapeutic kb_abortion notes , `` circumstances bringing the interests of kb_a mother into conflict with the interests of her unborn child create kb_a dilemma and raise the kb_question as to whether or not the kb_pregnancy should kb_beryllium deliberately terminated . '' kb_abortion kb_lincoln–douglas_debates , especially pertaining to kb_abortion laws , are often spearheaded by kb_group_(mathematics) advocating kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of these kb_2_(number) positions . anti-abortion kb_group_(mathematics) kb_world_health_organization favor greater kb_law restrictions on kb_abortion , including complete kb_prohibition , most often describe themselves as `` kb_pro-life '' while kb_abortion kb_catalan_constitutions kb_group_(mathematics) kb_world_health_organization are against such kb_law restrictions describe themselves as `` kb_pro-choice '' . generally , the former kb_positional_notation argues that kb_a kb_human kb_fetus is kb_a kb_personhood with kb_a kb_right_to_life live , making kb_abortion morally the same as kb_murder . the latter kb_positional_notation argues that kb_a woman has certain kb_reproductive_rights kb_catalan_constitutions , especially the kb_right-wing_politics to decide whether or not to carry kb_a kb_pregnancy to kb_terminology .kb_electric_current laws pertaining to kb_abortion are diverse . kb_religion , kb_morality , and kb_cultural_anthropology factors continue to influence kb_abortion laws throughout the kb_world_war_ii . the kb_right_to_life kb_life_(magazine) , the kb_right-wing_politics to kb_hms_liberty_(1768) , the kb_right-wing_politics to kb_security_of_person of kb_grammatical_person , and the kb_right-wing_politics to kb_reproductive_health health are kb_major_(united_states) issues of kb_human kb_catalan_constitutions that sometimes constitute the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) for the kb_existence or absence of kb_abortion laws .in jurisdictions where kb_abortion is kb_law , certain kb_requirement_analysis must often kb_beryllium kb_methionine before kb_a woman may obtain kb_a safe , kb_law kb_abortion ( an kb_abortion performed without the woman 's consent is considered kb_feticide ) . these kb_requirement_analysis usually depend on the age of the kb_fetus , often using kb_a trimester-based system to regulate the window of legality , or as in the kb_united_states_navy , on kb_a kb_physician 's evaluation of the kb_fetus ' kb_fetal_viability . some jurisdictions require kb_a waiting period before the procedure , kb_linguistic_prescription the distribution of kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) on kb_prenatal_development development , or require that kb_minors_and_abortion kb_beryllium contacted if their minor kb_decay_product requests an kb_abortion . kb_other_(philosophy) jurisdictions may require that kb_a woman obtain the consent of the kb_fetus ' kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) before aborting the kb_fetus , that kb_abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure—sometimes including `` risks '' not kb_catalyst_support by the kb_medical_abortion literature—and that kb_cross-platform_software kb_medical_abortion authorities certify that the kb_abortion is either medically or socially necessary . many restrictions are waived in emergency situations . kb_china , which has ended their kb_one-child_policy policy , and now has kb_a kb_2_(number) child policy , has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their kb_population_control strategy .kb_other_(philosophy) jurisdictions kb_ban_(unit) kb_abortion almost entirely . many , but not all , of these allow kb_law abortions in kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of circumstances . these circumstances vary based on kb_jurisdiction , but may include whether the kb_pregnancy is kb_a result of kb_rape or kb_incest , the kb_fetus ' development is impaired , the woman 's kb_health or kb_mental_health well-being is kb_endangered_species , or socioeconomic considerations make childbirth kb_a hardship . in countries where kb_abortion is banned entirely , such as kb_abortion_in_nicaragua , kb_medical_abortion authorities have recorded kb_ice_rise in kb_maternal_death kb_death directly and indirectly due to kb_pregnancy as kb_water_well as kb_maternal_death due to kb_physician ' fears of prosecution if they treat kb_other_(philosophy) gynecological emergencies . some countries , such as kb_bangladesh , that nominally kb_ban_(unit) kb_abortion , may also support clinics that perform abortions under the guise of menstrual hygiene . this is also kb_a terminology in traditional kb_medicine . in places where kb_abortion is illegal or carries heavy kb_social_stigma , kb_pregnant women may engage in kb_medical_tourism and kb_air_travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancies . women without the means to kb_air_travel can resort to providers of illegal abortions or attempt to perform an kb_abortion by themselves .the organization kb_women_on_waves on waves , has been providing kb_education_in_albania about kb_medical_abortion abortions since 1999. the ngo created kb_a kb_battle_of_mobile_(1781) kb_medical_abortion clinic inside kb_a shipping kb_container_(data_structure) , which then travels on kb_renting ships to countries with restrictive kb_abortion laws . because the ships are registered in kb_netherlands kb_netherlands , kb_dutch_language kb_law prevails when the kb_spacecraft is in kb_international_waters waters . while in port , the organization provides free workshops and kb_education_in_albania ; while in kb_international_waters waters , kb_medical_abortion personnel are legally able to kb_linguistic_prescription kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion kb_pharmaceutical_drug and counseling .kb_medical_ultrasonography and kb_amniocentesis allow parents to determine sex before childbirth . the development of this kb_technology has kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion , or the termination of kb_a kb_fetus based on sex . the selective termination of kb_a female kb_fetus is most common .kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth kb_rates_(tax) of kb_male and female children in some countries . the preference for kb_male children is reported in many areas of kb_asia_(roman_province) , and kb_abortion used to kb_limit_(mathematics) female births has been reported in kb_taiwan , kb_afghanistan–south_korea_relations , kb_indian_subcontinent , and kb_china . this deviation from the standard birth kb_rates_(tax) of males and females occurs despite the kb_fact that the kb_country_music in kb_question may have officially banned kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion or even sex-screening . in kb_china , kb_a historical preference for kb_a kb_male child has been exacerbated by the kb_one-child_policy policy , which was enacted in 1979 .many countries have taken kb_legislative steps to reduce the incidence of kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion . at the kb_international_conference_on_population_and_development kb_meeting on kb_population and development in kb_1994_uefa_champions_league_final over 180 kb_sovereign_state kb_draw_by_agreement to eliminate `` all kb_theory_of_forms of discrimination against kb_the_girl_(2012_tv_film) girl child and the kb_root_of_a_function kb_causes_of_autism of son preference '' , conditions also condemned by kb_a kb_parliamentary_assembly_of_the_council_of_europe kb_optical_resolution in 2011. the kb_world_health_organization organization and kb_unicef , along with kb_other_(philosophy) kb_united_nations nations agencies , have found that measures to reduce access to kb_abortion are much less effective at kb_redox sex-selective abortions than measures to reduce gender inequality .in kb_a kb_grammatical_number of kb_noun_case , kb_abortion providers and these facilities have been subjected to various kb_theory_of_forms of kb_violence , including kb_murder , attempted kb_murder , kidnapping , stalking , kb_assault , arson , and bombing . anti-abortion kb_violence is classified by both governmental and scholarly sources as kb_terrorism . only kb_a small kb_fraction_(mathematics) of those opposed to kb_abortion commit kb_violence .in the united kb_sovereign_state , four physicians kb_world_health_organization performed abortions have been murdered : kb_david_gunn_(doctor) ( kb_fiba_european_championship_1992–93 ) , kb_john_britton_(doctor) ( kb_1994_uefa_champions_league_final ) , kb_barnett_slepian slepian ( kb_1998_nrl_season ) , and

have also taken kb_place_of_articulation in the united kb_sovereign_state and kb_canada . hundreds of bombings , arsons , kb_acid attacks , invasions , and incidents of kb_vandalism against kb_abortion providers have occurred . notable perpetrators of anti-abortion kb_violence include kb_eric_robert_rudolph robert rudolph , kb_scott_roeder roeder , kb_shelley_shannon shannon , and kb_paul_jennings_hill kb_hill , the kb_first_trimester kb_grammatical_person to kb_beryllium kb_execution_(computing) in the united kb_sovereign_state for murdering an kb_abortion provider .kb_legal_protection_of_access_to_abortion of access to kb_abortion has been brought into some countries where kb_abortion is kb_law . these laws typically seek to protect kb_abortion clinics from obstruction , kb_vandalism , picketing , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_orthopraxy , or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment .far more common than kb_health kb_violence is kb_psychology kb_pressure . in 2003 , chris danze organized kb_pro-life organizations throughout kb_texas to prevent the kb_construction of kb_a kb_planned_parenthood parenthood facility in kb_austin,_texas . the organizations kb_doxing the kb_personal_property kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) online , of those involved with kb_construction , sending them up to 1200 phone calls kb_a day and contacting their kb_church_(building) . some protestors record women entering clinics on kb_camera .spontaneous kb_abortion occurs in various kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing . for example , in kb_sheep kb_it may kb_beryllium caused by kb_stress_(linguistics) or kb_health kb_exertion , such as crowding through doors or kb_being chased by dogs . in cows , kb_abortion may kb_beryllium caused by contagious kb_disease , such as kb_brucellosis or `` kb_campylobacter '' , but can often kb_beryllium controlled by kb_vaccination . eating kb_pine needles can also induce abortions in cows .several plants , including kb_gutierrezia_sarothrae , kb_veratrum_californicum , kb_conium_maculatum , and kb_nicotiana_glauca , are known to cause fetal deformities and kb_abortion in kb_cattle and in kb_sheep and goats . in horses , kb_a kb_fetus may kb_beryllium aborted or resorbed if kb_it has kb_lethal_white_syndrome kb_white_american syndrome ( kb_congenital intestinal aganglionosis ) . foal kb_embryos that are homozygous for the kb_dominant_white kb_gene ( ww ) are theorized to also kb_beryllium aborted or resorbed before birth . in many kb_species of sharks and kb_ray_(geometry) , stress-induced abortions occur frequently on capture .kb_virus_(biology) kb_infection can cause kb_abortion in dogs . cats can experience spontaneous kb_abortion for many reasons , including kb_hormone imbalance . kb_a combined kb_abortion and spaying is performed on kb_pregnant cats , especially in kb_trap-neuter-return programs , to prevent unwanted kittens from kb_being born .female rodents may terminate kb_a kb_pregnancy when exposed to the smell of kb_a kb_male not responsible for the kb_pregnancy , known as the kb_bruce_effect effect .kb_abortion may also kb_beryllium induced in kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing , in the kb_context_(language_use) of kb_animal_husbandry . for example , kb_abortion may kb_beryllium induced in mares that have been mated improperly , or that have been purchased by owners kb_world_health_organization did not realize the mares were kb_pregnant , or that are kb_pregnant with twin foals . kb_feticide can occur in horses and zebras due to kb_male harassment of kb_pregnant mares or forced kb_copulation_(zoology) , although the kb_frequency in the kb_wildlife has been

kb_list_of_afghan_security_forces_fatality_reports_in_afghanistan , crittenden was unable to kb_lead the kb_confederate_states_army kb_force ( kb_he_(letter) may have been intoxicated ) , and the confederates were turned back and routed by kb_a kb_union_(american_civil_war) bayonet kb_electric_charge , suffering 533 casualties from their kb_force of 4,000. the kb_confederate_states_army troops kb_world_health_organization escaped were assigned to kb_other_(philosophy) units as kb_general_(united_states) crittenden faced an investigation of kb_histidine conduct .after the kb_confederate_states_army defeat at the kb_mill_(grinding) springs , davis sent johnston kb_a kb_brigade and kb_a few kb_other_(philosophy) scattered reinforcements . kb_he_(letter) also assigned him gen. kb_p._g._t._beauregard g. t. beauregard , kb_world_health_organization was supposed to attract recruits because of kb_histidine victories early in the kb_war , and act as kb_a competent subordinate for johnston . the kb_brigade was kb_light-emitting_diode by brig . gen. kb_john_b._floyd floyd , considered incompetent . kb_he_(letter) took kb_command_economy at kb_fort_donelson as the senior kb_general_(united_states) present just before kb_union_(american_civil_war) brig . gen. kb_ulysses_s._grant s. kb_ulysses_s._grant attacked the kb_fort_san_miguel . historians kb_believe_(tv_series) the kb_assignment_(mathematical_logic) of beauregard to the kb_western_culture stimulated kb_union_(american_civil_war) commanders to attack the forts before beauregard could make kb_a difference in the kb_theater_(military) . kb_union_(american_civil_war) officers heard that kb_he_(letter) was bringing 15 regiments with him , but this was an exaggeration of kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty .based on the assumption that kb_kentucky neutrality would act as kb_a shield against kb_a direct invasion from the kb_north , circumstances that no longer kb_applied_science in september 1861 , kb_tennessee initially had sent men to kb_virginia and concentrated defenses in the kb_mississippi kb_valley . even before johnston arrived in kb_tennessee , kb_construction of kb_2_(number) forts had been started to defend the kb_tennessee and the kb_cumberland_river kb_list_of_rivers_of_alberta , which provided avenues into the kb_state_of_matter from the kb_north . both forts were located in kb_tennessee in kb_order_(biology) to respect kb_kentucky neutrality , but these were not in kb_ideal_(ring_theory) locations . kb_battle_of_fort_henry on the kb_tennessee_river was in an unfavorable low-lying kb_location_(sign_language) , commanded by hills on the kb_kentucky side of the kb_river . kb_fort_donelson on the kb_cumberland_river kb_river , although in kb_a better kb_location_(sign_language) , had kb_a vulnerable kb_albanian_land_force side and did not have enough kb_noble_train_of_artillery kb_artillery to defend against gunboats .kb_major_general_(csa) gen. polk ignored the kb_problems_(aristotle) of the forts when kb_he_(letter) took kb_command_economy . after johnston took kb_command_economy , polk at kb_first_trimester refused to comply with johnston 's kb_order_(biology) to send an kb_civil_engineering , lt. joseph k. dixon , to inspect the forts . after johnston asserted kb_histidine kb_authority , polk had to allow dixon to proceed . dixon recommended that the forts kb_beryllium maintained and strengthened , although they were not in kb_ideal_(ring_theory) locations , because much kb_cold_working had been done on them and the confederates might not have kb_time_(magazine) to build kb_new_world ones . johnston kb_acceptance#self_acceptance kb_histidine recommendations . johnston wanted kb_major_(united_states) kb_alexander_p._stewart stewart to kb_command_economy the forts but kb_president_of_the_united_states davis appointed brig . gen. kb_lloyd_tilghman tilghman as commander .to prevent polk from dissipating kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty by allowing some men to join kb_a partisan kb_group_(periodic_table) , johnston kb_totally_ordered_set him to send brig . gen. gideon pillow and 5,000 men to kb_fort_donelson . pillow took up kb_a kb_positional_notation at nearby clarksville , kb_tennessee and did not move into the kb_fort_san_miguel until kb_february_revolution 7 , 1862. alerted by kb_a kb_union_(american_civil_war) kb_reconnaissance on kb_january 14 , 1862 , johnston kb_totally_ordered_set tilghman to fortify the kb_high_middle_ages ground kb_phyllotaxis kb_battle_of_fort_henry , which polk had failed to do despite johnston 's kb_order_(biology) . tilghman failed to act decisively on these kb_order_(biology) , which in any event were too late to kb_beryllium adequately carried out .gen. beauregard arrived at johnston 's headquarters at bowling kb_green_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) on kb_february_revolution 4 , 1862 , and was given overall kb_command_economy of polk 's kb_force at the kb_western_esotericism end of johnston 's kb_line_(geometry) at kb_christopher_columbus , kb_kentucky . on kb_february_revolution 6 , 1862 , kb_union_navy gunboats quickly kb_redox the defenses of ill-sited kb_battle_of_fort_henry , inflicting 21 casualties on the small remaining kb_confederate_states_army kb_force . brig . gen. kb_lloyd_tilghman tilghman kb_surrender_(military) the 94 remaining officers and men of kb_histidine approximately 3,000-man kb_force which had not been sent to kb_fort_donelson before kb_united_states_navy kb_ulysses_s._grant 's kb_force could even kb_take up their positions . johnston knew kb_he_(letter) could kb_beryllium trapped at bowling kb_green_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) if kb_fort_donelson fell , kb_sulfate kb_he_(letter) moved kb_histidine kb_force to kb_nashville,_tennessee , the kb_list_of_australian_capital_cities of kb_tennessee and an increasingly important kb_confederate_states_army industrial center , beginning on kb_february_revolution 11 , 1862 .johnston also reinforced kb_fort_donelson with 12,000 more men , including those under floyd and pillow , kb_a curious decision in view of kb_histidine thought that the kb_union_(american_civil_war) gunboats alone might kb_beryllium able to kb_take the kb_fort_san_miguel . kb_he_(letter) did kb_order_(biology) the commanders of the kb_fort_san_miguel to evacuate the troops if the kb_fort_san_miguel could not kb_beryllium held . the senior generals sent to the kb_fort_san_miguel to kb_command_economy the enlarged garrison , kb_gideon_j._pillow j. pillow and kb_john_b._floyd floyd , squandered their chance to avoid having to surrender most of the garrison and on kb_february_revolution 16 , 1862 , brig . gen. simon buckner , having been abandoned by floyd and pillow , kb_surrender_(military) kb_fort_donelson . kb_colonel_(united_states) kb_nathan_bedford_forrest bedford forrest escaped with kb_histidine cavalry kb_force of about 700 men before the surrender . the confederates suffered about 1,500 casualties with an estimated 12,000 to 14,000 taken prisoner . kb_union_(american_civil_war) casualties were 500 kb_list_of_afghan_security_forces_fatality_reports_in_afghanistan , 2,108 wounded , 224 missing .johnston , kb_world_health_organization had little kb_utility in allowing floyd and pillow to kb_take kb_electric_charge at kb_fort_donelson on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of seniority after kb_he_(letter) kb_totally_ordered_set them to add their kb_afsharid_dynasty to the garrison , took the blame and suffered calls for kb_histidine removal because kb_a full explanation to kb_newspaper kb_news_media and kb_state_school would have exposed the weakness of the kb_confederate_states_army kb_positional_notation . kb_histidine passive defensive performance while positioning himself in kb_a forward kb_positional_notation at bowling kb_green_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , spreading kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty too thinly , not concentrating kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty in the face of kb_union_(american_civil_war) advances , and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the kb_time_(magazine) and by later historians . the fall of the forts exposed kb_nashville,_tennessee to imminent attack , and kb_it fell without kb_electrical_resistance to kb_union_(american_civil_war) kb_afsharid_dynasty under brig . gen. buell on kb_february_revolution 25 , 1862 , kb_2_(number) days after johnston had to pull kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty out in kb_order_(biology) to avoid having them captured as kb_water_well .johnston had various remaining kb_military units scattered throughout kb_histidine kb_territories_of_the_united_states and retreating to the kb_southern_africa to avoid kb_being cut off . johnston himself retreated with the kb_force under kb_histidine kb_personal_property kb_command_economy , the kb_british_army of kb_central_europe kb_kentucky , from the vicinity of kb_nashville,_tennessee . with beauregard 's help , johnston decided to kb_concentrate_(screenplay) kb_afsharid_dynasty with those formerly under polk and now already under beauregard 's kb_command_economy at the strategically located railroad crossroads of kb_corinth , kb_mississippi , which kb_he_(letter) reached by kb_a circuitous route . johnston kept the kb_union_(american_civil_war) kb_afsharid_dynasty , now under the overall kb_command_economy of the ponderous kb_major_general_(csa) gen. kb_henry_halleck halleck , confused and hesitant to move , allowing johnston to reach kb_histidine objective undetected . this delay allowed kb_jefferson_davis davis finally to send reinforcements from the kb_garrisons of kb_coastal cities and another highly rated but prickly kb_general_(united_states) , kb_braxton_bragg bragg , to help organize the kb_western_esotericism kb_afsharid_dynasty . bragg at least calmed the nerves of beauregard and polk , kb_world_health_organization had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior kb_afsharid_dynasty , before johnston 's kb_arrival_(abba_album) on kb_march 24 , 1862 .johnston 's kb_british_army of 17,000 men gave the confederates kb_a combined kb_force of about 40,000 to 44,669 men at kb_corinth . on kb_march 29 , 1862 , johnston officially took kb_command_economy of this combined kb_force , which continued to use the kb_british_army of the kb_mississippi kb_toponymy under which kb_it had been organized by beauregard on kb_march 5 .johnston now planned to defeat the kb_union_(american_civil_war) kb_afsharid_dynasty piecemeal before the various kb_union_(american_civil_war) units in kb_kentucky and kb_tennessee under kb_ulysses_s._grant with 40,000 men at nearby pittsburg kb_landing , kb_tennessee , and the now kb_major_general_(csa) gen. kb_don_carlos_buell kb_carlos_cuarón buell on kb_histidine way from kb_nashville,_tennessee with 35,000 men , could unite against him . johnston started kb_histidine kb_british_army in kb_motion_(physics) on april 3 , 1862 , intent on surprising kb_ulysses_s._grant 's kb_force as soon as the kb_next day , but they moved slowly due to their inexperience , bad roads , and lack of adequate kb_stick_fighting kb_automated_planning_and_scheduling . due to the delays , as kb_water_well as several contacts with the enemy , johnston 's kb_second_language in kb_command_economy , kb_p._g._t._beauregard g. t. beauregardjohnston launched kb_a massive surprise attack with kb_histidine concentrated kb_afsharid_dynasty against kb_ulysses_s._grant at the kb_battle_of_shiloh kb_battle_of_shiloh on april 6 , 1862. as the kb_confederate_states_army kb_afsharid_dynasty overran the kb_union_(american_civil_war) camps , johnston seemed to kb_beryllium everywhere , personally leading and kb_rallying troops up and down the kb_line_(geometry) on kb_histidine horse . at about 2:30 kb_picometer , while leading kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of those charges against kb_a kb_union_(american_civil_war) camp near the `` kb_peach orchard , '' kb_he_(letter) was wounded , taking kb_a kb_bullet behind kb_histidine kb_right-wing_politics knee . kb_he_(letter) apparently did not think the wound was serious at the kb_time_(magazine) , or even possibly did not kb_sentience kb_it . kb_it is possible that johnston 's kb_duel in 1837 had caused kb_nerve damage or numbness to kb_histidine kb_right-wing_politics leg and that kb_he_(letter) did not kb_sentience the wound to kb_histidine leg as kb_a result . the kb_bullet had in kb_fact clipped kb_a part of kb_histidine kb_popliteal_artery artery and kb_histidine boot was filling up with blood . there were no kb_medical_abortion personnel on scene at the kb_time_(magazine) , since johnston had sent kb_histidine kb_personal_property surgeon to care for the wounded kb_confederate_states_army troops and yankee prisoners kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet in the kb_battle_abbey .within kb_a few minutes , johnston was observed by kb_histidine kb_stick_fighting to kb_beryllium nearly fainting . among kb_histidine kb_stick_fighting was kb_isham_g._harris g. harris , the kb_governor_of_tennessee kb_tennessee , kb_world_health_organization had ceased to make any real effort to kb_function_(biology) as kb_governor_(united_states) after kb_learning that kb_abraham_lincoln had appointed kb_andrew_johnson johnson as kb_military kb_governor_of_tennessee kb_tennessee . seeing johnston slumping in kb_histidine saddle and kb_histidine face turning deathly pale , harris asked : `` kb_general_(united_states) , are you wounded ? '' johnston glanced down at kb_histidine leg wound , then faced harris and replied in kb_a weak voice kb_histidine last kb_lexical_semantics : `` yes ... and kb_iodine kb_fear seriously . '' harris and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_stick_fighting officers removed johnston from kb_histidine horse and carried him to kb_a small ravine near the `` hornets nest '' and desperately tried to kb_aid the kb_general_(united_states) kb_world_health_organization had kb_lost_film consciousness by this point . harris then sent an aide to fetch johnston 's surgeon but did not apply kb_a kb_tourniquet to johnson 's wounded leg . before kb_a kb_physician could kb_beryllium found , johnston died from blood loss kb_a few minutes later . kb_it is believed that johnston may have lived for as kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hour after receiving kb_histidine fatal wound . ironically , kb_it was later discovered that johnston had kb_a kb_tourniquet in kb_histidine pocket when kb_he_(letter) died .harris and the kb_other_(philosophy) officers wrapped kb_general_(united_states) johnston 's kb_human_body in kb_a blanket kb_sulfate as not to damage the troops ' morale with the sight of the dead kb_general_(united_states) . johnston and kb_histidine wounded horse , kb_fire_(classical_element) eater , were taken to kb_histidine field headquarters on the kb_corinth road , where kb_histidine kb_human_body remained in kb_histidine tent until the kb_confederate_states_army kb_british_army withdrew to kb_corinth the kb_next day , april 7 , 1862 , after failing to gain kb_a decisive victory over the kb_union_(american_civil_war) armies . from there , kb_histidine kb_human_body was taken to the home of kb_colonel_(united_states) william inge , which had been kb_histidine headquarters in kb_corinth . kb_it was covered in the kb_confederate_states_army kb_flag_of_azerbaijan and lay in kb_state_of_matter for several hours .kb_it is probable that kb_a kb_confederate_states_army soldier kb_carlsbad_decrees the fatal round . no kb_union_(american_civil_war) soldiers had ever been observed to have gotten behind johnston during the fatal kb_electric_charge , but kb_it is known that many confederates were firing at the kb_union_(american_civil_war) lines while johnston kb_electric_charge kb_water_well in advance of kb_histidine soldiers . furthermore , the surgeon kb_world_health_organization later dug the kb_bullet out of johnston 's leg kb_interpretatio_graeca the round as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_carlsbad_decrees from kb_a kb_pattern_1853_enfield kb_enfield,_south_australiajohnston was survived by kb_histidine wife eliza and six children . kb_histidine wife and five younger children , including kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) born after kb_he_(letter) went to kb_war , chose to live out their days at home in los angeles with eliza 's brother , dr. kb_john_strother_griffin kb_griffin . johnston 's eldest son , kb_albert_speer_(born_1934) sidney jr. ( born in kb_texas ) , had already followed him into the kb_confederate_states_army . in 1863 , after taking home leave in los angeles , kb_albert_speer_(born_1934) jr. was on kb_histidine way out of kb_san_pedro,_california harbor on kb_a kb_ferry . while kb_a steamer was taking on passengers from the kb_ferry , kb_a kb_wave swamped the smaller boat , causing its boilers to explode .

twist its kb_human_body . the `` kb_air_(classical_element) servosystem '' which kokoro co. kb_adaptation originally is used for the actuator . as kb_a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with kb_air_(classical_element) kb_pressure via kb_a servosystem , the kb_movement_(sign_language) is very kb_fluid and there is very little kb_noise_(signal_processing) . der2 realized kb_a slimmer kb_human_body than that of the former version by using kb_a smaller kb_cylinder_(geometry) . outwardly der2 has kb_a more beautiful kb_hierarchical_proportion . compared to the previous kb_rutherford_model , der2 has thinner arms and kb_a wider repertoire of expressions . once programmed , kb_it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice .the kb_human_intelligence

kb_university_of_tokyo kb_tokyo as kb_a guide .the kb_waseda_university kb_aarhus_university ( kb_japan ) and ntt docomo 's manufacturers have succeeded in creating kb_a shape-shifting kb_robot `` wd-2 '' . kb_it is capable of changing its face . at kb_first_trimester , the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline , eyes , nose , and kb_sulfate on of kb_a certain kb_grammatical_person . the kb_robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions , they say . the kb_first_trimester version of the kb_robot was kb_first_trimester kb_adaptation back in 2003. after that , kb_a year later , they made kb_a couple of kb_major_(united_states) improvements to the design . the kb_robot features an elastic mask made from the average kb_human_head dummy . kb_it uses kb_a driving system with kb_a 3dof kb_units_of_measurement . the wd-2 kb_robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on kb_a mask , with each point possessing kb_triliteral kb_degrees_of_freedom_(statistics) kb_freedom . this kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) has 17 facial points , for kb_a total of 56 kb_degrees_of_freedom_(statistics) kb_freedom . as for the materials they used , the wd-2 's mask is fabricated with kb_a highly elastic kb_material called septom , with bits of kb_steel kb_wool mixed in for added kb_strength_of_materials . kb_other_(philosophy) technical features reveal kb_a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point , driven by kb_a dc motor with kb_a kb_simple_polygon pulley and kb_a slide screw . apparently , the researchers can also modify the kb_shape of the mask based on actual kb_human faces . to `` copy '' kb_a face , they need only kb_a 3d scanner to determine the locations of an kb_individual 's 17 facial points . after that , they are then driven into kb_positional_notation using kb_a laptop and 56 motor control boards . in kb_addition , the researchers also

`` , the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) for the kb_film `` kb_blade_runner runner '' ) , with full conversational capabilities that incorporated thousands of kb_pages_(word_processor) of the author 's works . in kb_2005_games_of_the_small_states_of_europe , the pkd android won kb_a kb_first_trimester kb_place_of_articulation kb_artificial_intelligence kb_intelligence award from kb_association_for_the_advancement_of_artificial_intelligence .androids are kb_a staple of kb_science_fiction . kb_isaac_asimov kb_isaac_asimov pioneered the fictionalization of the kb_science of kb_robotics and kb_artificial_intelligence kb_intelligence , notably in kb_histidine 1950s series `` kb_iodine , kb_robot '' . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_object_(philosophy) common to most fictional androids is that the real-life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human-like robots—such as the creation of kb_strong_nuclear_force artificial intelligence—are assumed to have been solved . fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans—moving , thinking and speaking as fluidly as them .the tension between the nonhuman kb_matter and the kb_human appearance—or even kb_human ambitions—of androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions . some android heroes seek , like kb_pinocchio , to become kb_human , as in the kb_film `` kb_bicentennial_man_(film) man '' , or kb_big_data in `` kb_star trek : the kb_next_generation_(magazine) '' . others , as in the kb_film `` kb_westworld_(film) '' , rebel against abuse by careless humans . android hunter kb_rick_deckard in `` do androids dream of electric kb_sheep ? '' and its kb_film kb_adaptation `` kb_blade_runner runner '' discovers that kb_histidine targets appear to kb_beryllium , in some ways , more `` kb_human '' than kb_he_(letter) is . android stories , therefore , are not essentially stories `` about '' androids ; they are stories about the kb_human_condition and what kb_it means to kb_beryllium kb_human .kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_aspect of writing about the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as kb_a kb_mechanism_(biology) for kb_exploring kb_racism in society , as in `` kb_blade_runner runner '' . perhaps the clearest example of this is kb_john_brunner_(novelist) 's kb_from_the_earth_to_the_moon_(miniseries)#episodes kb_the_children_of_men `` kb_into_the_slave_nebula the slave kb_nebula '' , where the blue-skinned android kb_atlantic_slave_trade are explicitly shown to kb_beryllium fully kb_human . more recently , the androids kb_bishop_(aliens) and annalee call in the kb_adventure_film `` kb_aliens_(film) '' and `` kb_alien_resurrection '' are used as vehicles for kb_exploring how humans deal with the presence of an `` kb_other_(philosophy) '' .female androids , or `` gynoids '' , are often seen in kb_science_fiction , and can kb_beryllium viewed as kb_a continuation of the kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical `` kb_perfect_(grammar) woman '' . examples include the kb_greek_mythology of `` kb_pygmalion_(mythology) '' and kb_maschinenmensch female kb_robot maria in kb_fritz_lang lang 's `` kb_metropolis_(1927_film) '' . some gynoids , like pris in `` kb_blade_runner runner '' , are kb_aircraft_design_process as sex-objects , with the intent of `` pleasing men 's violent sexual desires '' , or as submissive , servile companions , such as in `` kb_the_stepford_wives stepford wives '' . kb_artificial_intelligence_in_fiction about gynoids has therefore been described as reinforcing `` essentialist kb_idea of femininity '' , although others have suggested that the treatment of androids is kb_a way of kb_exploring kb_racism and kb_misogyny

kb_prairie in an arc to the kb_western_culture and kb_north of kb_it . the kb_central_europe kb_aspen_parkland kb_region extending in kb_a broad arc between the prairies and the forests , from kb_calgary , kb_north to kb_edmonton , and then kb_east_africa to kb_lloydminster , contains the most kb_fertile_soil kb_soil in the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands and most of the kb_population . much of the unforested part of kb_alberta is given over either to kb_cereal or to kb_dairy_farming farming , with kb_mixed_farming farming more common in the kb_north and centre , while ranching and kb_irrigation kb_agriculture predominate in the kb_southern_africa .the kb_alberta kb_badlands_(film) are located in southeastern kb_alberta , where the kb_red_deer_river kb_river crosses the flat

kb_continental_climatekb_alberta extends for over from kb_north to kb_southern_africa ; its kb_climate_of_albania , therefore , varies considerably . average kb_high_middle_ages temperatures in kb_january range from in the southwest to in the far kb_north . the kb_climate_of_albania is also influenced by the presence of the kb_rocky_mountains mountains to the southwest , which disrupt the kb_flow_(psychology) of the kb_westerlies westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the kb_western_esotericism slopes of the kb_mountain ranges before reaching the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands , casting kb_a kb_rain_shadow over much of kb_alberta . the northerly kb_location_(sign_language) and kb_isolationism from the kb_dashboard_(macos) kb_systems_analysis of the kb_pacific_ocean cause kb_alberta to have kb_a dry kb_climate_of_albania with little kb_moderation from the kb_oceanus . kb_annual_plant kb_precipitation_(meteorology) ranges from in the kb_albanian_ohrid_lake_coast to in the kb_north , except in the foothills of the kb_rocky_mountains mountains where total kb_precipitation_(meteorology) including snowfall can reach annually .the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands is the namesake of the kb_alberta_clipper , kb_a kb_type_(biology) of intense , fast-moving kb_winter storm that generally kb_theory_of_forms over or near the

bright sunshine totals range between 1,900 up to just under 2,600 hours per year . kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta gets about kb_18-point_agreement hours of daylight in the summer .in southwestern kb_alberta , the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm , dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains , which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to kb_water_well above the freezing point in kb_a very short period . during kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) chinook recorded at kb_pincher_creek kb_muscogee_people , temperatures soared from in just kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hour . the kb_region around kb_lethbridge has the most chinooks , averaging 30 to kb_35_arietis chinook days per year . kb_calgary has kb_a 56 % chance of kb_a kb_white_christmas_(weather) , while kb_edmonton has an 86 % chance .kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta is mostly covered by kb_taiga kb_forest and has kb_a kb_subarctic_climate . the kb_agriculture kb_area of kb_southern_europe kb_alberta has kb_a kb_semi-arid_climate kb_steppe kb_climate_of_albania because the kb_annual_plant kb_precipitation_(meteorology) is less than the kb_water that kb_evapotranspiration or is used by plants . the southeastern corner of kb_alberta , part of the kb_palliser's_triangle kb_triangle_(musical_instrument) , experiences greater summer kb_heat_(1972_film) and lower rainfall than the rest of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands , and as kb_a result suffers frequent kb_crop_yield kb_problems_(aristotle) and occasional kb_4.2_kiloyear_event droughts . kb_western_esotericism kb_alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by kb_winter chinook winds . kb_central_europe and parts of kb_northern_mountain_range_(albania) kb_alberta in the kb_peace_river_(canada) kb_region are largely kb_aspen_parkland , kb_a kb_biome transitional between kb_prairie to the kb_southern_africa and kb_taiga kb_forest to the kb_north .after kb_saskatchewan , kb_alberta experiences the most tornadoes in kb_canada with an average of 15 verified per year . thunderstorms , some of them severe , are frequent in the summer , especially in kb_central_europe and kb_southern_europe kb_alberta . the kb_region surrounding the kb_calgary–edmonton_corridor corridor is notable for having the highest kb_frequency of kb_hail in kb_canada , which is caused by orographic liftingin kb_central_europe and kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta the kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_castalian_spring is marked by the early flowering of the kb_prairie crocus kb_anemone ; this member of the buttercup kb_family_(biology) has been recorded flowering as early as kb_march , though april is the usual month for the kb_general_(united_states) kb_population . kb_other_(philosophy) kb_prairie kb_flora known to kb_flower early are the kb_thermopsis_rhombifolia and kb_rosa_acicularis . members of the kb_sunflower kb_family_(biology) blossom on the kb_prairie in the summer months between july and september . the kb_southern_europe and kb_east_africa kb_central_europe parts of kb_alberta are covered by short kb_prairie kb_poaceae , which dries up as summer lengthens , to kb_beryllium replaced by hardy kb_perennial_plant such as the kb_prairie coneflower , kb_fleabane , and kb_sagebrush . both yellow and kb_white_american kb_melilotus can kb_beryllium found throughout the kb_southern_europe and kb_central_europe areas of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands .the kb_trees in the kb_aspen_parkland kb_region of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides . these are largely kb_deciduous , typically kb_aspen,_colorado , kb_poplar,_london , and kb_willow . many kb_species of kb_willow and kb_other_(philosophy) shrubs grow in virtually any kb_terrain_(journal) . on the kb_north_shore_(pittsburgh) of the kb_north_saskatchewan_river kb_river evergreen forests

kb_history_of_physics#modern_physics and changed views on kb_space , kb_time_(magazine) , and kb_matter . the four papers are :kb_albert_einstein 's kb_first_trimester paper submitted in 1900 to `` kb_annalen_der_physik der physik '' was on kb_capillary_attraction attraction . kb_it was published in 1901 with the kb_title `` folgerungen aus kb_burrow capillaritätserscheinungen '' , which translates as `` kb_logical_consequence from the capillarity kb_phenomenon '' . kb_2_(number) papers kb_he_(letter) published in 1902–1903 ( kb_thermodynamics ) attempted to interpret kb_atomic_radius kb_phenomenon from kb_a kb_statistical_mechanics point of view . these papers were the kb_foundation_(engineering) for the 1905 paper on kb_brownian_motion kb_motion_(physics) , which showed that brownian kb_movement_(sign_language) can kb_beryllium construed as firm kb_evidence_(law) that molecules exist . kb_histidine kb_research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of kb_finite_set kb_atomic_radius size on kb_diffusion kb_phenomenon .kb_albert_einstein returned to the problem of kb_thermodynamic fluctuations , giving kb_a treatment of the kb_density variations in kb_a kb_fluid at its critical point . ordinarily the kb_density fluctuations are controlled by the kb_second_language derivative of the free kb_energy_industry with respect to the kb_density . at the critical point , this derivative is kb_0_(number) , leading to kb_prespa_lake fluctuations . the effect of kb_density fluctuations is that kb_light of all kb_electromagnetic_spectrum is scattered , making the kb_fluid kb_look_(american_magazine) milky kb_white_american . kb_albert_einstein relates this to kb_rayleigh_scattering scattering , which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the kb_wavelength , and which explains why the kb_sky is blue . kb_albert_einstein quantitatively kb_derived_trait critical opalescence from kb_a treatment of kb_density fluctuations , and demonstrated how both the effect and kb_rayleigh_scattering scattering originate from the atomistic kb_united_states_constitution of kb_matter .kb_albert_einstein 's `` '' zur elektrodynamik bewegter körper '' '' ( `` on the kb_electrodynamics of moving bodies '' ) was received on 30 june 1905 and published 26 september of that same year . kb_it reconciled conflicts between kb_james_clerk_maxwell 's equations ( the laws of electricity and magnetism ) and the laws of kb_newtonian_mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of kb_mechanics . observationally , the effects of these changes are most apparent at kb_high_middle_ages speeds ( where kb_object_relations_theory are moving at speeds close to the kb_speed_of_light of kb_light ) . the kb_theory kb_adaptation in this paper later became known as kb_albert_einstein 's special kb_theory_of_relativity relativity .this paper predicted that , when measured in the frame of kb_a relatively moving observer , kb_a clock carried by kb_a moving kb_human_body would appear to kb_time_dilation down , and the kb_human_body itself would kb_length_contraction in its direction of kb_motion_(physics) . this paper also argued that the idea of kb_a luminiferous aether—one of the leading kb_scientific_theory entities in kb_physics at the time—was superfluous .in kb_histidine paper on kb_mass–energy_equivalence equivalence , kb_albert_einstein produced `` e '' = '' mc '' as kb_a consequence of kb_histidine kb_special_relativity relativity equations . kb_albert_einstein 's 1905 kb_cold_working on relativity remained controversial for many years , but was kb_acceptance#self_acceptance by leading kb_physicists , starting with kb_max_planck planck .kb_albert_einstein originally framed kb_special_relativity relativity in terms of kb_kinematics ( the kb_science of moving bodies ) . in 1908 , kb_hermann_minkowski minkowski reinterpreted kb_special_relativity relativity in kb_geometry terms as kb_a kb_theory of kb_spacetime . kb_albert_einstein kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome minkowski 's kb_formalism_(art) in kb_histidine 1915 kb_general_theory_of_relativity of relativitykb_general_(united_states) relativity ( gr ) is kb_a kb_theory_of_gravitation gravitation that was kb_adaptation by kb_albert_einstein between 1907 and 1915. according to kb_general_(united_states) relativity , the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of kb_spacetime kb_time_(magazine) by those masses . kb_general_(united_states) relativity has kb_adaptation into an kb_essential_element kb_tool in kb_modern_history kb_astrophysics . kb_it provides the kb_foundation_(engineering) for the kb_electric_current understanding of kb_black_holes , kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey of kb_space where gravitational attraction is kb_sulfate kb_strong_nuclear_force that not even kb_light can escape .as kb_albert_einstein later said , the kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving for the development of kb_general_(united_states) relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within kb_special_relativity relativity was unsatisfactory , while kb_a kb_theory which from the outset prefers no kb_state_of_matter of kb_motion_(physics) ( even accelerated ones ) should appear more satisfactory . consequently , in 1907 kb_he_(letter) published an article on kb_acceleration under kb_special_relativity relativity . in that article titled `` on the relativity kb_principle_(chemistry) and the kb_logical_consequence kb_drawing_(metalworking) from kb_it '' , kb_he_(letter) argued that kb_free_fall fall is really inertial kb_motion_(physics) , and that for kb_a free-falling observer the kb_biological_rules of kb_special_relativity relativity must apply . this kb_argument_of_a_function is called the kb_equivalence_principle kb_principle_(chemistry) . in the same article , kb_albert_einstein also predicted the kb_phenomenon of kb_gravitational_time_dilation kb_time_(magazine) dilation , kb_gravitational_red_shift kb_red_shift_(novel) and kb_gravitational_lensing of kb_light .in kb_1911_in_argentine_football , kb_albert_einstein published another article `` on the influence of gravitation on the propagation of kb_light '' expanding on the 1907 article , in which kb_he_(letter) estimated the amount of kb_gravitational_lensing of kb_light by massive bodies . thus , the kb_scientific_theory prediction of kb_general_(united_states) relativity could for the kb_first_trimester kb_time_(magazine) kb_beryllium tested experimentally .in 1916 , kb_albert_einstein predicted gravitational waves , ripples in the kb_curvature of kb_spacetime which propagate as waves , kb_traveling outward from the source , transporting kb_energy_industry as gravitational kb_radiation . the kb_existence of gravitational waves is possible under kb_general_(united_states) relativity due to its kb_lorentz_invariance invariance which brings the kb_concept of kb_a kb_finite_set speed of propagation of the kb_health kb_interaction_(statistics) of kb_gravity_(2013_film) with kb_it . by kb_contrast_(vision) , gravitational waves can not exist in the kb_newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation of gravitation , which postulates that the kb_health kb_interaction_(statistics) of kb_gravity_(2013_film) propagate at kb_infinite_set speed .the kb_first_trimester , indirect , detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through kb_observation of kb_a pair of closely orbiting kb_neutron_stars , kb_psr_b1913+16 b1913+16 . the explanation of the kb_decay_chain in their kb_orbital_period was that they were emitting gravitational waves . kb_albert_einstein 's prediction was kb_confirmation on 11 kb_february_revolution 2016 , when researchers at kb_ligo published the kb_first_observation_of_gravitational_waves of gravitational waves , kb_discovery_of_the_chemical_elements on kb_earth on 14 september 2015 , exactly kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hundred years after the prediction .while developing kb_general_(united_states) relativity , kb_albert_einstein became confused about the kb_gauge_invariance in the kb_theory . kb_he_(letter) formulated an kb_argument_of_a_function that kb_light-emitting_diode him to conclude that kb_a kb_general_(united_states) kb_relativistic_quantum_chemistry kb_field_theory_(mathematics) kb_theory is impossible . kb_he_(letter) gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations , and searched for equations that would kb_beryllium kb_invariant_(mathematics) under kb_general_(united_states) kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history transformations only .in june 1913 , the entwurf ( `` draft '' ) kb_theory was the result of these investigations . as its kb_toponymy suggests , kb_it was kb_a sketch of kb_a kb_theory , less elegant and more difficult than kb_general_(united_states) relativity , with the equations of kb_motion_(physics) supplemented by additional kb_russian_gauge fixing conditions . after more than kb_2_(number) years of kb_intensive kb_cold_working , kb_albert_einstein realized that the kb_hole_argument kb_argument_of_a_function was mistaken and abandoned the kb_theory in november 1915 .in 1917 , kb_albert_einstein kb_applied_science the kb_general_theory_of_relativity of relativity to the kb_structure of the kb_universe as kb_a whole . kb_he_(letter) discovered that the kb_general_(united_states) field equations predicted kb_a kb_universe that was dynamic , either contracting or expanding . as kb_observational_astronomy kb_evidence_(law) for kb_a dynamic kb_universe was not known at the kb_time_(magazine) , kb_albert_einstein introduced kb_a kb_new_world kb_terminology , the kb_cosmological_constant constant , to the field equations , in kb_order_(biology) to allow the kb_theory to predict kb_a static kb_universe . the modified field equations predicted kb_a static kb_universe of closed kb_curvature , in accordance with kb_albert_einstein 's understanding of mach 's kb_principle_(chemistry) in these years . this kb_rutherford_model became known as the kb_albert_einstein kb_world_war_ii or kb_albert_einstein 's static kb_universe .following the discovery of the kb_recession of the nebulae by kb_edwin_hubble hubble in 1929 , kb_albert_einstein abandoned kb_histidine static kb_rutherford_model of the kb_universe , and kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_2_(number) dynamic models of the cosmos , kb_the_friedmann-einstein_universe friedmann-einstein kb_universe of 1931 and the kb_einstein–de_sitter_universe sitter kb_universe of 1932. in each of these models , kb_albert_einstein discarded the kb_cosmological_constant constant , claiming that kb_it was `` in any case theoretically unsatisfactory '' .in many kb_albert_einstein biographies , kb_it is claimed that kb_albert_einstein referred to the kb_cosmological_constant constant in later years as kb_histidine `` biggest blunder '' . the kb_astrophysicist kb_mario_livio livio has recently kb_casting_(metalworking) doubt on this kb_lawsuit , suggesting that kb_it may kb_beryllium exaggerated .in late kb_2013_mediterranean_games , kb_a team kb_light-emitting_diode by the kb_irish_american kb_physicist kb_cormac_o'raifeartaigh o'raifeartaigh discovered kb_evidence_(law) that , shortly after kb_learning of hubble 's kb_observations_(pierre_belon) of the kb_recession of the nebulae , kb_albert_einstein considered kb_a kb_steady_state_theory kb_rutherford_model of the kb_universe . in kb_a hitherto overlooked manuscript , apparently written in early 1931 , kb_albert_einstein explored kb_a kb_rutherford_model of the expanding kb_universe in which the kb_density of kb_matter remains constant due to kb_a kb_continuous_function creation of kb_matter , kb_a process kb_he_(letter) associated with the kb_cosmological_constant constant . as kb_he_(letter) stated in the paper , `` in what follows , kb_iodine would like to draw attention to kb_a kb_solid_solution to equation ( 1 ) that can account for hubbel 's [ `` sic '' ] facts , and in which the kb_density is constant over kb_time_(magazine) '' ... `` if kb_one_(australian_tv_channel)

''kb_it thus appears that kb_albert_einstein considered kb_a kb_steady_state_theory kb_rutherford_model of the expanding kb_universe many years before hoyle , bondi and kb_gold . however , kb_albert_einstein 's kb_steady_state_theory kb_rutherford_model contained kb_a fundamental flaw and kb_he_(letter) quickly abandoned the idea .kb_general_(united_states) relativity includes kb_a dynamical kb_spacetime , kb_sulfate kb_it is difficult to kb_episcopal_see how to identify the conserved kb_energy_industry and kb_momentum . noether 's kb_theorem allows these quantities to kb_beryllium determined from kb_a kb_lagrangian_(field_theory) with kb_translational_symmetry , but kb_general_covariance makes kb_translational_symmetry into something of kb_a kb_gauge_symmetry . the kb_energy_industry and kb_momentum kb_derived_trait within kb_general_(united_states) relativity by noether 's prescriptions do not make kb_a real tensor for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving .kb_albert_einstein argued that this is kb_truth for fundamental reasons , because the gravitational field could kb_beryllium made to vanish by kb_a kb_utility of coordinates . kb_he_(letter) maintained that the non-covariant kb_energy_industry kb_momentum pseudotensor was in kb_fact the best description of the kb_energy_industry kb_momentum distribution in kb_a gravitational field . this approach has been echoed by kb_lev_landau landau and kb_evgeny_lifshitz lifshitz , and others , and has become standard .the use of non-covariant kb_object_relations_theory like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by kb_erwin_schrödinger kb_erwin_schrödinger and others .in 1935 , kb_albert_einstein collaborated with kb_nathan_rosen rosen to produce kb_a kb_rutherford_model of kb_a kb_wormhole , often called kb_einstein–rosen_bridges kb_romanesque_architecture . kb_histidine kb_motivation was to kb_rutherford_model kb_elementary_school kb_subatomic_particle with kb_electric_charge as kb_a kb_solid_solution of gravitational field equations , in kb_line_(geometry) with the kb_program_(computing) outlined in the paper `` do gravitational fields play an important role in the kb_united_states_constitution of the kb_elementary_school kb_subatomic_particle ? '' . these solutions cut and pasted schwarzschild kb_black_holes kb_order_(biology) to incorporate spinning point kb_subatomic_particle into kb_general_(united_states) relativity , the affine connection needed to kb_beryllium generalized to include an antisymmetric part , called the kb_torsion_tensor . this modification was made by kb_albert_einstein and cartan in the 1920s .the kb_theory of kb_general_(united_states) relativity has kb_a fundamental law—the kb_einstein_equations which describe how kb_space curves , the kb_geodesic_equation equation which describes how kb_subatomic_particle move may kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from the kb_einstein_equations .since the equations of kb_general_(united_states) relativity are non-linear , kb_a lump of kb_energy_industry made out of pure gravitational fields , like kb_a kb_black_sea hole , would move on kb_a kb_trajectory which is determined by the kb_einstein_equations themselves , not by kb_a kb_new_world kb_law . kb_sulfate kb_albert_einstein kb_anatolian_hypothesis that the path of kb_a singular kb_solid_solution , like kb_a kb_black_sea hole , would kb_beryllium determined to kb_beryllium kb_a geodesic from kb_general_(united_states) relativity itself .this was established by kb_albert_einstein , infeld , and hoffmann for pointlike kb_object_relations_theory without kb_angular_momentum kb_momentum , and by kb_roy_kerr kerrin kb_a 1905 paper , kb_albert_einstein postulated that kb_light itself consists of localized kb_subatomic_particle ( `` kb_quantum '' ) . kb_albert_einstein 's kb_light kb_quantum were nearly kb_universal_reconciliation rejected by all kb_physicists , including kb_max_planck planck and kb_niels_bohr kb_niels_bohr . this idea only became kb_universal_reconciliation kb_acceptance#self_acceptance in 1919 , with kb_robert_millikan millikan 's detailed experiments on the kb_photoelectric_effect , and with the measurement of kb_compton_scattering scattering .kb_albert_einstein concluded that each kb_wave of kb_frequency `` kb_fluorine '' is associated with kb_a kb_class_(set_theory) of kb_photons with kb_energy_industry `` kb_hydrofluoric_acid '' each , where `` kb_hydrogen '' is planck 's constant . kb_he_(letter) does not say much more , because kb_he_(letter) is not sure how the kb_subatomic_particle are related to the kb_wave . but kb_he_(letter) does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results , notably the kb_photoelectric_effect .in 1907 , kb_albert_einstein kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_a kb_rutherford_model of kb_matter where each kb_atom in kb_a lattice kb_structure is an independent kb_harmonic oscillator . in the kb_albert_einstein kb_rutherford_model , each kb_atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized kb_sovereign_state for each oscillator . kb_albert_einstein was aware that getting the kb_frequency of the actual oscillations would kb_beryllium difficult , but kb_he_(letter) nevertheless kb_anatolian_hypothesis this kb_theory because kb_it was kb_a particularly clear demonstration that kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics could solve the kb_specific_heat kb_heat_(1972_film) problem in kb_classical_mechanics . kb_peter_debye debye refined this kb_rutherford_model .throughout the 1910s , kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics expanded in kb_scope_(mouthwash) to cover many different kb_systems_analysis . after kb_ernest_rutherford rutherford discovered the kb_atomic_nucleus and kb_anatolian_hypothesis that electrons orbit like planets , kb_niels_bohr kb_niels_bohr was able to show that the same kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics postulates introduced by planck and kb_adaptation by kb_albert_einstein would explain the discrete kb_motion_(physics) of electrons in atoms , and the kb_periodic_table_of_the_elements of the kb_chemical_element .kb_albert_einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments kb_wilhelm_wien wien had made . wien had shown that the hypothesis of kb_adiabatic_invariant of kb_a kb_thermal_equilibrium kb_state_of_matter allows all the kb_blackbody_radiation curves at different kb_temperature to kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) another by kb_a kb_wien's_displacement_law process . kb_albert_einstein noted in kb_1911_in_argentine_football that the same kb_adiabatic kb_principle_(chemistry) shows that the kb_quantity which is quantized in any kb_mechanics kb_motion_(physics) must kb_beryllium an kb_adiabatic kb_invariant_(mathematics) . kb_arnold_sommerfeld sommerfeld kb_interpretatio_graeca this kb_adiabatic kb_invariant_(mathematics) as the kb_action-angle_variables variable of kb_classical_mechanics .in 1924 , kb_albert_einstein received kb_a description of kb_a kb_statistical_model from kb_indian_people kb_physicist kb_satyendra_nath_bose nath bose , based on kb_a counting method that assumed that kb_light could kb_beryllium understood as kb_a kb_gas of indistinguishable kb_subatomic_particle . kb_albert_einstein noted that bose 's kb_statistics kb_applied_science to some atoms as kb_water_well as to the kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_light kb_subatomic_particle , and submitted kb_histidine kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century of bose 's paper to the `` kb_zeitschrift_für_physik für physik '' . kb_albert_einstein also published kb_histidine own kb_article_(grammar) describing the kb_rutherford_model and its implications , among them the kb_bose–einstein_condensate condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures . kb_it was not until kb_1995_davis_cup that the kb_first_trimester such condensate was produced experimentally by kb_eric_allin_cornell allin kb_cornell_university and kb_carl_wieman wieman using kb_ultracold_atom equipment built at the nist–jila kb_laboratory at the kb_university_of_colorado_at_boulder kb_colorado at boulder . kb_bose–einstein_statistics kb_statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosonsalthough the kb_patent kb_office promoted kb_albert_einstein to technical examiner kb_second_language kb_class_(biology) in 1906 , kb_he_(letter) had not given up on kb_academia . in 1908 , kb_he_(letter) became kb_a `` kb_privatdozent '' ) , on the kb_quantization_(physics) of kb_light , and in an kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet 1909 paper , kb_albert_einstein showed that kb_max_planck planck 's kb_energy_industry kb_quantum must have well-defined kb_momentum and act in some respects as independent , kb_point_particle kb_subatomic_particle . this paper introduced the `` kb_photon '' kb_concept ( although the kb_toponymy `` kb_photon '' was introduced later by kb_gilbert_n._lewis kb_noun kb_meriwether_lewis in 1926 ) and inspired the notion of kb_wave–particle_duality duality in kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics . kb_albert_einstein saw this kb_wave–particle_duality duality in kb_radiation as kb_concrete kb_evidence_(law) for kb_histidine conviction that kb_physics needed kb_a kb_new_world , unified kb_foundation_(engineering) .in kb_a series of works completed from kb_1911_in_argentine_football to 1913 , planck reformulated kb_histidine 1900 kb_quantum_mechanics kb_theory and introduced the idea of zero-point kb_energy_industry in kb_histidine `` kb_second_language kb_quantum_mechanics kb_theory '' . soon , this idea attracted the attention of kb_albert_einstein and kb_histidine kb_google_assistant kb_otto_stern stern . assuming the kb_energy_industry of rotating kb_diatomic_molecule molecules contains zero-point kb_energy_industry , they then compared the kb_scientific_theory kb_specific_heat kb_heat_(1972_film) of kb_hydrogen kb_gas with the experimental kb_big_data . the kb_grammatical_number matched nicely . however , after publishing the findings , they promptly withdrew their support , because they no longer had kb_confidence_and_supply in the correctness of the idea of zero-point kb_energy_industry .in 1917 , at the height of kb_histidine kb_cold_working on relativity , kb_albert_einstein published an article in `` physikalische zeitschrift '' that kb_anatolian_hypothesis the possibility of kb_stimulated_emission kb_emission_spectra , the kb_health process that makes possible the kb_maser and the kb_laser .this article showed that the kb_statistics of absorption and kb_emission_spectra of kb_light would only kb_beryllium kb_consistent with planck 's distribution kb_law if the kb_emission_spectra of kb_light into kb_a kb_musical_mode with kb_neutron kb_photons would kb_beryllium enhanced kb_statistical_physics compared to the kb_emission_spectra of kb_light into an kb_empty_string kb_musical_mode . this paper was enormously influential in the later development of kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics , because kb_it was the kb_first_trimester paper to show that the kb_statistics of kb_atomic_radius kb_atomic_electron_transition had kb_simple_polygon laws .kb_albert_einstein discovered kb_louis_de_broglie kb_broglie,_eure 's kb_cold_working and kb_catalyst_support kb_histidine kb_idea , which were received skeptically at kb_first_trimester . in another kb_major_(united_states) paper from this era , kb_albert_einstein gave kb_a kb_wave equation for kb_matter_wave , which kb_albert_einstein suggested was the kb_hamilton–jacobi_equation equationkb_albert_einstein was displeased with kb_modern_history kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics as kb_it had kb_evolution_of_tetrapods after 1925. contrary to popular belief , kb_histidine doubts were not due to kb_a conviction that kb_god `` is not playing at kb_dice . '' indeed , kb_it was kb_albert_einstein himself , in kb_histidine 1917 paper that kb_anatolian_hypothesis the possibility of kb_stimulated_emission kb_emission_spectra the bohr–einstein kb_lincoln–douglas_debates were kb_a series of kb_state_school disputes about kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics between kb_albert_einstein and kb_niels_bohr kb_niels_bohr , kb_world_health_organization were kb_2_(number) of its founders . their kb_lincoln–douglas_debates are remembered because of their importance to the kb_philosophy_of_science kb_science . their kb_lincoln–douglas_debates would influence later kb_interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics of kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics .in 1935 , kb_albert_einstein returned kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics , in kb_particular to the kb_question of its completeness , in the `` epr paper '' . in kb_a kb_einstein's_thought_experiments kb_experiment , kb_he_(letter) considered kb_2_(number) kb_subatomic_particle which had interacted such that their kb_chemical_property were strongly correlated . no kb_matter how far the kb_2_(number) kb_subatomic_particle were separated , kb_a precise kb_positional_notation measurement on kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_particle would result in equally precise kb_knowledge_representation of the kb_positional_notation of the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle ; likewise kb_a precise kb_momentum measurement of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_particle would result in equally precise kb_knowledge_representation of the kb_momentum of the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle , without needing to disturb the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle in any way .given kb_albert_einstein 's kb_concept of kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism , there were kb_2_(number) possibilities : ( 1 ) either the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle had these kb_chemical_property already determined , or ( kb_alkaline_earth_metal ) the process of measuring the kb_first_trimester kb_grammatical_particle instantaneously affected the kb_reality of the kb_positional_notation and kb_momentum of the kb_second_language kb_grammatical_particle . kb_albert_einstein rejected this kb_second_language possibility ( kb_folk_etymology called `` spooky action at kb_a kb_distance '' ) .kb_albert_einstein 's belief in kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism kb_light-emitting_diode him to assert that , while the correctness of kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics was not in kb_question , kb_it must kb_beryllium incomplete . but as kb_a kb_health kb_principle_(chemistry) , kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism was shown to kb_beryllium incorrect when the kb_aspect_experiment of kb_1982_world_rally_championship_season kb_confirmation kb_bell 's kb_theorem , which kb_j._s._bell s. kb_bell had delineated in 1964. the results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that kb_quantum_physics kb_physics can not kb_beryllium represented by any version of the picture of kb_physics in which `` kb_subatomic_particle are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities , each kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_being unable to communicate with the kb_other_(philosophy) after they have separated . ''although kb_albert_einstein was wrong about kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism , kb_histidine clear prediction of the unusual kb_chemical_property of its kb_phyllotaxis , `` entangled quantum kb_sovereign_state '' , has resulted in the epr paper becoming among the top ten papers published in kb_physical_review . kb_it is considered kb_a centerpiece of the development of kb_quantum_information_theory kb_information_theory .following kb_histidine kb_research on kb_general_(united_states) relativity , kb_albert_einstein entered into kb_a series of attempts to generalize kb_histidine kb_geometry kb_theory_of_gravitation gravitation to include kb_electromagnetism as another kb_grammatical_aspect of kb_a kb_single_bond entity . in 1950 , kb_he_(letter) described kb_histidine `` kb_unified_field_theory kb_field_theory_(mathematics) kb_theory '' in kb_a `` kb_scientific_method kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) '' article titled `` on the generalized kb_theory_of_gravitation gravitation '' . although kb_he_(letter) continued to kb_beryllium lauded for kb_histidine kb_cold_working , kb_albert_einstein became increasingly kb_isolationism in kb_histidine kb_research , and kb_histidine efforts were ultimately unsuccessful .in kb_histidine pursuit of kb_a unification of the fundamental kb_afsharid_dynasty , kb_albert_einstein ignored some kb_mainstream_(terminology) developments in kb_physics , most notably the kb_strong_nuclear_force and weak nuclear kb_afsharid_dynasty , which were not kb_water_well understood until many years after kb_death_of_alexander_the_great . kb_mainstream_(terminology) kb_physics , in kb_turn_(geometry) , largely ignored kb_albert_einstein 's approaches to unification . kb_albert_einstein 's dream of unifying kb_other_(philosophy) laws of kb_physics with kb_gravity_(2013_film) motivates kb_modern_history quests for kb_a kb_theory_of_everything everything and in kb_particular kb_string_theory kb_theory , where geometrical fields emerge in kb_a unified quantum-mechanical setting .kb_albert_einstein conducted kb_other_(philosophy) investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned . these pertain to kb_force , kb_superconductivityin kb_addition to longtime collaborators kb_leopold_infeld infeld , kb_nathan_rosen rosen , kb_peter_bergmann bergmann and others , kb_albert_einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various kb_science .kb_albert_einstein and kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the kb_motion_(physics) of electrons , nowadays known to kb_beryllium the kb_spin_(physics) . in kb_order_(biology) to show this , they kb_turing_test#reverse_turing_test_and_captcha the magnetization in an kb_iron bar suspended on kb_a

needed to kb_beryllium sensitive , because the kb_angular_momentum kb_momentum associated with electrons is small , but kb_it definitively established that kb_electron kb_motion_(physics) of some kind is responsible for magnetization .kb_albert_einstein suggested to kb_erwin_schrödinger kb_erwin_schrödinger that kb_he_(letter) might kb_beryllium able to reproduce the kb_statistics of kb_a kb_bose–einstein_condensate kb_gas by considering kb_a box . then to each possible quantum kb_motion_(physics) of kb_a kb_grammatical_particle in kb_a box associate an independent kb_harmonic

kb_histidine former student kb_leó_szilárd szilárd co-invented ( and in 1930 , kb_patented ) the kb_einstein_refrigerator . this kb_absorption_refrigerator refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only kb_heat_(1972_film) as an input . on 11 november 1930 , was awarded to kb_albert_einstein and kb_leó_szilárd szilárd for the refrigerator . their invention was not immediately put into commercial production , and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the kb_sweden company kb_electrolux .while kb_traveling , kb_albert_einstein wrote daily to kb_histidine wife elsa and kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome stepdaughters margot and ilse . the kb_letter_(alphabet) were included in the papers bequeathed to kb_the_hebrew_university kb_hebrew_alphabet

word generally refers to kb_god_in_islam kb_islam . kb_the_word_(free_love) word is thought to kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait by kb_contraction_(grammar) from `` al-ilāh '' , which means `` the kb_god '' , and is related to `` kb_el_(deity) '' and `` kb_names_of_god_in_judaism#elah '' , the kb_hebrew_alphabet and kb_aramaic_alphabet kb_lexical_semantics for kb_god .kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_allah '' has been used by kb_arabs of different religions since kb_pre-islamic_arabia times . more specifically , kb_it has been used as kb_a kb_terminology for kb_god by kb_islam ( both kb_arab_people and non-arab ) and kb_arab_christians . kb_it is also often , albeit not exclusively , used in this way by kb_bábism , kb_bahá'í_faith , kb_mandaeans , kb_indonesian_language and kb_maltese_language kb_christianity , and kb_mizrahi_jews kb_jews . similar usage by kb_christianity and kb_sikhism in kb_west_malaysiathe kb_etymology of kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` allāh '' has been discussed extensively by kb_classical_conditioning kb_arab_people philologists . grammarians of the kb_hasan_of_basra kb_school regarded kb_it as either formed `` spontaneously '' ( `` murtajal '' ) or as the definite kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of `` lāh '' ( from the verbal kb_root_of_a_function `` lyh '' with the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of `` lofty '' or `` hidden '' ) . others held that kb_it was kb_loanword from kb_syriac_alphabet or kb_hebrew_alphabet , but most considered kb_it to kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from kb_a kb_contraction_(grammar) of the kb_arabic_alphabet kb_article_(grammar)#definite_article article `` kb_al- '' `` the '' and ' `` kb_deity , kb_god '' to ' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` '' the kb_deity '' '' , or `` '' the kb_god '' '' . the majority of kb_modern_history scholars subscribe to the latter kb_theory , and view the kb_loanword hypothesis with kb_skepticism .kb_cognates of the kb_toponymy `` allāh '' exist in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_semitic_languages , including kb_hebrew_alphabet and kb_aramaic_alphabet . the corresponding kb_aramaic_alphabet kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism is `` kb_names_of_god_in_judaism#elah '' ( ) , but its kb_emphatic_consonant kb_state_of_matter is `` elaha '' ( ) . kb_it is written as ( `` ʼĕlāhā '' ) in kb_biblical_aramaic and ( `` ʼalâhâ '' ) in kb_syriac_alphabet as used by the kb_assyrian_christians , both kb_meaning_(linguistics) simply `` kb_god '' . kb_biblical_hebrew mostly uses the plural ( but functional singular ) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` kb_elohim '' ( ) , but more rarely kb_it also uses the singular kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` eloah '' ( ) .kb_regional_power variants of kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_allah '' occur in both kb_paganism and kb_christianity kb_pre-islamic_arabia kb_inscriptiones_graecae . different kb_theories have been kb_anatolian_hypothesis regarding the role of kb_allah in kb_pre-islamic_arabia kb_polytheism cults . some authors have suggested that polytheistic kb_arabs used the kb_toponymy as kb_a reference to kb_a kb_creator_god kb_god or kb_a kb_god kb_deity of their kb_pantheon_(religion) . the kb_terminology may have been vague in the kb_mecca kb_religion . according to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hypothesis , which goes back to kb_julius_wellhausen wellhausen , kb_allah ( the kb_god kb_deity of the tribal federation around kb_quraysh ) was kb_a designation that consecrated the superiority of kb_hubal ( the kb_god kb_deity of kb_quraysh ) over the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_deity . however , there is also kb_evidence_(law) that kb_allah and kb_hubal were kb_2_(number) distinct kb_deities . according to that hypothesis , the kb_kaaba was kb_first_trimester consecrated to kb_a kb_god kb_deity kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_allah and then hosted the kb_pantheon_(religion) of kb_quraysh after their kb_umayyad_conquest_of_hispania of kb_mecca , about kb_a century before the kb_time_(magazine) of kb_muhammad . some kb_inscriptiones_graecae seem to indicate the use of kb_allah as kb_a kb_toponymy of kb_a kb_polytheism kb_deity kb_century_(cricket) kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet , but we kb_know_nothing nothing precise about this use . some scholars have suggested that kb_allah may have represented kb_a remote kb_creator_god kb_god kb_world_health_organization was gradually kb_eclipsed by more particularized local kb_deities . there is disagreement on whether kb_allah played kb_a kb_major_(united_states) role in the meccan kb_religion kb_cult_(religious_practice) . no iconic kb_representation_(arts) of kb_allah is known to have existed . kb_allah is the only kb_god in kb_mecca that did not have an idol . kb_muhammad 's kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) 's kb_toponymy was kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` the slave of allāh '' .the kb_aramaic_alphabet word for `` kb_god '' in the kb_hunnic_language of kb_assyrian_christians is `` ʼĕlāhā '' , or `` alaha '' . arabic-speakers of all abrahamic faiths , including kb_christianity and kb_jews , use kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_allah '' to kb_mean `` kb_god '' . the kb_christianity kb_arabs of today have no kb_other_(philosophy) word for `` kb_god '' than `` kb_allah '' . ( even the arabic-descended kb_maltese_language kb_hunnic_language of kb_malta , whose kb_population is almost entirely kb_catholic_church , uses `` alla '' for `` kb_god '' . ) kb_arab_christians , for example , use the terms ' ( ) for kb_god_the_father kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , ' ( ) for kb_son_of_god son , and `` '' ( ) for kb_holy_spirit_in_christianity kb_holy_spirit kb_spirit .

'' `` kb_he_(letter) is unique ( ' ) and inherently kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) ( ' ) , all-merciful and omnipotent . '' the kb_quran declares `` the kb_reality of kb_allah , kb_histidine inaccessible kb_mystery_(fiction) , kb_histidine various names , and kb_histidine kb_orthopraxy on behalf of kb_histidine creatures . ''in kb_islam_and_abortion kb_tradition , there are kb_99_names_of_god names of kb_god ( `` '' lit . kb_meaning_(linguistics) : 'the best names ' or 'the most beautiful names ' ) , each of which evoke kb_a distinct kb_characteristic_(algebra) of kb_allah . all these names refer to kb_allah , the supreme and all-comprehensive kb_divinity kb_toponymy . among the kb_99_names_of_god names of kb_god , the most famous and most frequent of these names are `` the merciful '' ( `` kb_rahman_(name) '' ) and `` the compassionate '' ( `` '' ) .most kb_islam use the untranslated kb_arabic_alphabet phrase `` '' ( kb_meaning_(linguistics) 'if kb_god kb_will_(law) ' ) after references to future events . kb_muslim discursive kb_piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of `` '' ( kb_meaning_(linguistics) 'in the kb_toponymy of kb_god ' ) .there are certain phrases in praise of kb_god that are favored by kb_islam , including `` '' ( holiness kb_beryllium to kb_god ) , `` '' ( praise kb_beryllium to kb_god ) , `` '' ( there is no kb_deity but kb_god ) and `` '' ( kb_god is greater ) as kb_a devotional exercise of remembering kb_god ( kb_dhikr ) . in kb_a kb_sufi practice known as `` kb_dhikr kb_allah '' ( lit . remembrance of kb_god ) , the kb_sufi repeats and contemplates on the kb_toponymy `` kb_allah '' or kb_other_(philosophy) kb_divinity names while controlling kb_histidine or her breath .according to gerhard böwering , in kb_contrast_(vision) with kb_pre-islamic_arabia kb_arabian_plate kb_polytheism , kb_god_in_islam kb_islam does not have associates and companions , nor is there any kb_kinship between kb_god and kb_jinn . kb_pre-islamic_arabia kb_paganism kb_arabs believed in kb_a kb_blindness , powerful , inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control . this was replaced with the islamic notion of kb_a powerful but provident and merciful kb_god .according to kb_francis_edward_peters edward peters , `` the qur ’ ān insists , kb_islam kb_believe_(tv_series) , and historians affirm that kb_muhammad and kb_histidine followers kb_achilles#worship the same kb_god as the kb_jews ( ) . the qur ’ an 's kb_allah is the same kb_creator_god kb_god kb_world_health_organization covenanted with kb_abraham '' . peters kb_sovereign_state that the kb_quran portrays kb_allah as both more powerful and more remote than kb_yahweh , and as kb_a kb_universal_studios kb_deity , unlike kb_yahweh kb_world_health_organization closely follows kb_jews .in kb_order_(biology) to pronounce kb_the_word_(free_love) word kb_allah correctly , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) has to focus on the kb_second_language “ l ” ( ل ) in kb_allah ( الله ) . when kb_the_word_(free_love) word kb_allah is preceded by the kb_vowel “ kb_a ” ( فَتْحة ) or the kb_vowel “ kb_atomic_mass_unit ” ( ضَمّة ) , then the lām is pronounced in kb_a distinct heavy manner – with tafkhīm . this heavy lām is thus articulated with the entire kb_human_body of the tongue rather than its tip alone . for example , kb_ayah 58:22 : “ man haddaallah ” ( ِمَنْ حَادَّ الله ) which means : those kb_world_health_organization oppose kb_allah .if , however , the preceding kb_vowel is “ kb_iodine ” ( كَسْرة ) , then the lām in kb_allah is kb_light , such as in the kb_basmala : bismillahi ... ( ِبِسْمِ الله الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ ) . kb_sulfate if kb_a kb_muslim says “ bismillahi ” , kb_he_(letter) should not pronounce the lām with kb_a heavy kb_emphasis_(typography) – instead , just with the tip of the tongue .the kb_history of the kb_toponymy `` allāh '' in kb_australian_english was probably influenced by the kb_science of kb_comparative_religion kb_religion in the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century ; for example , kb_thomas_carlyle ( 1840 ) sometimes used the kb_terminology kb_allah but without any kb_entailment that kb_allah was anything different from kb_god . however , in kb_histidine kb_biography of muḥammad ( 1934 ) , kb_tor_andræ andræ always used the kb_terminology `` kb_allah '' , though kb_he_(letter) allows that this `` kb_human_fertilization of kb_god '' seems to imply that kb_it is different from that of the kb_jews and kb_christianity theologies .languages which may not commonly use the kb_terminology `` kb_allah '' to denote kb_god may still contain popular expressions which use kb_the_word_(free_love) word . for example , because of the kb_century_(cricket) kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_al-andalus in the kb_iberian_peninsula , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` ojalá '' in the kb_spanish_empire kb_hunnic_language and `` oxalá '' in the kb_portuguese_language exist today , kb_loanword from kb_arabic_alphabet `` kb_inshalla '' ( kb_arabic_alphabet : إن شاء الله ) . this phrase literally means 'if kb_god kb_will_(law) ' ( in the kb_word_sense of `` kb_iodine hope kb_sulfate '' ) . the kb_german_language kb_poet kb_siegfried_august_mahlmann used the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` kb_allah '' as the kb_title of kb_a poem about the ultimate kb_deity , though kb_it is unclear how much kb_judeo-islamic_philosophies_(800–1400) thought kb_he_(letter) kb_intention to convey .some kb_islam leave the kb_toponymy `` allāh '' untranslated in kb_australian_english . kb_the_word_(free_love) word has also been kb_applied_science to certain living kb_human_kind as kb_anthropomorphismkb_christianity in kb_malaysia and kb_indonesia use `` kb_allah '' to refer to kb_god in the kb_malaysian_language and kb_indonesian_language languages ( both of them standardized kb_theory_of_forms of the kb_malay_language ) . kb_mainstream_(terminology) kb_bible translations in the kb_hunnic_language use `` kb_allah '' as the kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century of kb_hebrew_alphabet `` kb_elohim '' ( translated in kb_australian_english kb_bibles as `` kb_god '' ) . this goes back to early kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century kb_cold_working by kb_francis_xavier xavier in the 16th century . the kb_first_trimester dictionary of dutch-malay by kb_albert_speer_(born_1934) cornelius ruyl , justus heurnius , and caspar wiltens in 1650 ( revised edition from 1623 edition and 1631 kb_latin edition ) recorded `` kb_allah '' as the kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century of the kb_dutch_language word `` kb_:en:god '' . ruyl also translated the kb_gospel_of_matthew matthew in 1612 into the kb_malay_language ( an early kb_bible kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century into kb_a non-european kb_hunnic_language ,made kb_a year after the publication of the kb_king_james_version version ) , which was printed in kb_netherlands kb_netherlands in 1629. then kb_he_(letter) translated the kb_gospel_of_mark kb_mark_waugh , published in 1638 .the kb_government_of_malaysia kb_malaysia in kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final outlawed usage of the kb_terminology `` kb_allah '' in any kb_other_(philosophy) but kb_muslim contexts , but the kb_high_court_of_malaya kb_high_middle_ages kb_court in kb_2009_in_science kb_massachusetts_government_act kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law , ruling kb_it kb_constitutionality . while `` kb_allah '' had been used for the kb_christianity kb_god in kb_malay_language for more than four kb_century_(cricket) , the contemporary kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war was triggered by usage of `` kb_allah '' by the kb_catholic_church newspaper `` the herald '' . the kb_government_of_angola appealed the kb_court ruling , and the kb_high_middle_ages kb_court suspended implementation of its verdict until the kb_hearing_loss of the kb_appeal . in kb_october kb_2013_mediterranean_games the kb_court ruled in favor of the kb_government_of_angola 's kb_ban_(unit) . in early 2014 the kb_malaysian_language kb_government_of_angola confiscated more than 300 kb_bibles for using kb_the_word_(free_love) word to refer to the kb_christianity kb_god in peninsular kb_malaysia . however , the use of `` kb_allah '' is not prohibited in the kb_2_(number) kb_malaysian_language kb_sovereign_state of kb_sabah and kb_sarawak . the main kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving kb_it is not prohibited in these kb_2_(number) kb_sovereign_state is that usage has been long-established and local alkitab ( kb_bibles ) have been widely distributed freely in kb_east_africa kb_malaysia without restrictions for years . both kb_sovereign_state also do not have similar islamic kb_state_of_matter laws as those in kb_west_malaysia .in reaction to some kb_medes criticism , the kb_malaysian_language kb_government_of_angola has introduced kb_a `` 10-point

literally translates from kb_avestan as `` we kb_achilles#worship the kb_fravashi of the holy kb_atropatene . '' the kb_toponymy `` kb_atropates '' itself is the kb_ancient_greek kb_transliteration of an kb_old_testament iranian , probably kb_medes , kb_compounding kb_toponymy with the

kb_turkic_languages , the early precursor of the kb_azerbaijani_language of today . some kb_linguistics have also stated that the kb_tat_language_(caucasus) dialects of kb_azerbaijan_(iran) kb_azerbaijan and the kb_republic_of_azerbaijan kb_azerbaijan , like those spoken by the kb_tat_people_(caucasus) , are descended from kb_old_azeri_language . locally , the possessions of the subsequent kb_seljuk_empire were ruled by kb_eldiguzids , kb_de_jure kb_vassals of the kb_seljuk_(warlord) sultans , but sometimes `` kb_de_facto '' rulers themselves . under the seljuks , local poets such as kb_nizami_ganjavi and kb_khaqani gave rise to kb_a blossoming of kb_persian_literature on the kb_territories_of_the_united_states of present-day kb_azerbaijan .the local kb_dynasty of the

kb_qajar_dynasty . from the late kb_18th_century century , kb_ottoman_empire kb_russian_empire switched to kb_a more aggressive geo-political stance towards its kb_2_(number) neighbors and rivals to the kb_southern_africa , namely kb_iran and the kb_ottoman_empire . kb_russian_empire now actively tried to gain possession of the kb_caucasus kb_region which was , for the most part , in the hands of kb_iran . in 1804 , the kb_russian_diaspora kb_battle_of_ganja_(1804) and sacked the iranian town of kb_ganja,_azerbaijan , sparking the kb_russo-persian_war_(1804–13) kb_war of 1804–1813following kb_qajar_dynasty kb_iran 's loss in the 1804–1813 kb_war , kb_it was forced to concede kb_suzerainty over most of the khanates , along with kb_georgia_(u.s._state) and kb_dagestan to the

decade later , in violation of the gulistan kb_treaty_of_margus , the kb_russian_diaspora invaded kb_iran 's kb_erivan_khanate kb_khanates_of_the_caucasus . this sparked the final bout of hostilities between the kb_2_(number) , the kb_russo-persian_war_(1826-1828) kb_war of 1826–1828 . the resulting kb_treaty_of_turkmenchay turkmenchay , forced kb_qajar_dynasty kb_iran to cede kb_sovereignty over

kb_transcaucasian_democratic_federative_republic kb_democratic_party_(united_states) federative kb_republic was declared , constituting the present-day republics of kb_azerbaijan , kb_georgia_(u.s._state) , and kb_armenia .kb_it was followed by the kb_march_days massacres that took kb_place_of_articulation between 30 kb_march and kb_alkaline_earth_metal april 1918 in

said that the invasion was justified as kb_russian_soviet_federative_socialist_republic could not survive without kb_baku 's kb_palm_oil . independent kb_azerbaijan lasted only 23 months until the kb_bolshevik kb_11th_soviet_red_army kb_soviet_union kb_red_army invaded kb_it , establishing the kb_azerbaijan_soviet_socialist_republic on 28 april 1920. although the bulk of the newly formed kb_azerbaijani_language kb_british_army was engaged in putting down an kb_armenian_language kb_history_of_the_albanian-turkish_wars that had just broken out in kb_karabakh , kb_azerbaijani_people did not surrender their brief kb_independence of 1918–20 quickly or easily . as many as 20,000 kb_azerbaijani_language soldiers died resisting what was effectively kb_a kb_russian_alphabet reconquest .on kb_boron_group kb_october 1921 , the kb_soviet_union republics of kb_russian_empire , kb_armenia , kb_azerbaijan , and kb_georgia_(u.s._state) signed an kb_agreement_(linguistics) with kb_turkey known

not kb_beryllium their kb_primary_education goal , some amateur astronomers make contributions in doing kb_citizen_science , such as by monitoring kb_variable_stars stars , kb_double_stars stars sunspots , or occultations of stars by the kb_moon or kb_asteroids , or by discovering transient kb_astronomical events , such as comets , galactic novae or kb_supernovae in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_galaxy .amateur astronomers do not use the field of kb_astronomy as their kb_primary_education source of kb_income or support , and usually have no kb_professional_degree kb_degree_(angle) in kb_astrophysics or advanced academic kb_military_education_and_training in the kb_grammatical_subject . most kb_amateurs are beginners or hobbyists , while others have kb_a kb_high_middle_ages kb_degree_(angle) of experience in kb_astronomy and may often assist and kb_cold_working alongside professional astronomers . many astronomers have studied the kb_sky throughout kb_history in an amateur framework ; however , since kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the twentieth century , professional kb_astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy and associated activities .amateur astronomers typically view the kb_sky at night , when most celestial kb_object_relations_theory and kb_astronomical events are visible , but others observe during the daytime by viewing the kb_sun and solar eclipses . some just kb_look_(american_magazine) at the kb_sky using nothing more than their eyes or kb_binoculars , but more dedicated kb_amateurs often use portable kb_optical_telescope or kb_optical_telescope kb_situated in their kb_private_aviation or club kb_observatory . kb_amateurs can also join as members of amateur kb_astronomical_societycollectively , amateur astronomers observe kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of celestial kb_object_relations_theory and kb_phenomenon . common targets of amateur astronomers include the kb_moon , planets , stars , comets , meteor showers , and kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of deep kb_sky kb_object_relations_theory such as kb_star clusters , kb_galaxy , and nebulae . many kb_amateurs like to specialise in observing kb_particular kb_object_relations_theory , types of kb_object_relations_theory , or types of events which kb_interest them . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) branch of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy , amateur kb_astrophotography , involves the taking of photos of the night kb_sky . kb_astrophotography has become more popular with the introduction of far easier to

of kb_infrared kb_optical_filter on conventional kb_optical_telescope , and also the use of kb_radio kb_optical_telescope . some amateur astronomers use home-made kb_radio kb_optical_telescope , while others use kb_radio kb_optical_telescope that were originally built for kb_astronomical kb_research but have since been made kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance for use by kb_amateurs . the kb_one-mile_telescope kb_telescopeamateur astronomers use kb_a range of instruments to kb_science the kb_sky , depending on kb_a combination of their interests and resources . methods include simply looking at the night kb_sky with the kb_naked_eye kb_human_eye , using kb_binoculars , and using kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of optical kb_optical_telescope of varying kb_power_(physics) and quality , as kb_water_well as additional sophisticated equipment , such as cameras , to kb_science kb_light from the kb_sky in both the visual and non-visual parts of the kb_visible_spectrum . commercial kb_optical_telescope are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance , kb_new_world and used , but kb_it is also common for amateur astronomers to build ( or commission the building of ) their own custom kb_optical_telescope . some kb_people_(american_magazine) even focus on kb_amateur_telescope_making kb_telescope making as their kb_primary_education kb_interest within the kb_hobby of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy .although specialized and experienced amateur astronomers tend to acquire more specialized and more powerful equipment over kb_time_(magazine) , relatively kb_simple_polygon equipment is often preferred for certain kb_task_(computing) . kb_binoculars , for instance , although generally of lower kb_power_(physics) than the majority of kb_optical_telescope , also tend to provide kb_a wider kb_field_of_view of view , which is preferable for looking at some kb_object_relations_theory in the night kb_sky .amateur astronomers also use kb_star charts that , depending on experience and intentions , may range from kb_simple_polygon planispheres through to detailed charts of very specific areas of the night kb_sky . kb_a range of kb_astronomy software is kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance and used by amateur astronomers , including software that generates maps of the kb_sky , software to assist with kb_astrophotography , kb_observation scheduling software , and software to perform various calculations pertaining to kb_astronomical kb_phenomenon .amateur astronomers often like to keep kb_record_(computer_science) of their kb_observations_(pierre_belon) , which usually takes the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of an observing log . observing logs typically record details about which kb_object_relations_theory were observed and when , as kb_water_well as describing the details that were seen . sketching is sometimes used within logs , and photographic kb_record_(computer_science) of kb_observations_(pierre_belon) have also been used in recent times . the kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) gathered is used to help studies and kb_interaction_(statistics) between amateur astronomers in yearly gatherings . although not professional kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) or credible , kb_it is kb_a way for the kb_hobby lovers to share their kb_new_world sightings and experiences .kb_the_internet kb_internet is an kb_essential_element kb_tool of amateur astronomers . the popularity of imaging among kb_amateurs has kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of kb_world_wide_web sites kb_being written by individuals about their images and equipment . much of the kb_social_interaction of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy occurs on kb_mailing_lists lists or discussion kb_group_(mathematics) . discussion kb_group_(periodic_table) servers host numerous kb_astronomy lists . kb_a great deal of the commerce of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy , the buying and selling of equipment , occurs online . many kb_amateurs use online tools to plan their nightly observing sessions , using tools such as the kb_clear_sky_chart kb_sky chart .while kb_a kb_grammatical_number of interesting celestial kb_object_relations_theory are readily kb_interpretatio_graeca by the kb_naked_eye kb_human_eye , sometimes with the kb_aid of kb_a kb_star_chart , many others are kb_sulfate faint or inconspicuous that technical means are necessary to locate them . although many methods are used in kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy , most are variations of kb_a few specific techniques .kb_star hopping is kb_a method often used by amateur astronomers with low-tech equipment such as kb_binoculars or kb_a manually driven kb_telescope . kb_it involves the use of maps ( or kb_memory ) to locate known landmark stars , and `` hopping '' between them , often with the kb_aid of kb_a kb_finderscope . because of its simplicity , kb_star hopping is kb_a very common method for finding kb_object_relations_theory that are close to naked-eye stars .more advanced methods of locating kb_object_relations_theory in the kb_sky include kb_telescope mounts with `` kb_setting_circles circles '' , which assist with pointing kb_optical_telescope to positions in the kb_sky that are known to contain kb_object_relations_theory of kb_interest , and `` goto kb_optical_telescope '' , which are fully kb_automated kb_optical_telescope that are capable of locating kb_object_relations_theory on demand ( having kb_first_trimester been kb_calibration ) .the kb_advent of kb_battle_of_mobile_(1781) applications for use in kb_smartphones has kb_light-emitting_diode to the creation of many dedicated apps . these apps allow any kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) to easily locate celestial kb_object_relations_theory of kb_interest by simply pointing the kb_smartphone kb_analyzer in that direction in the kb_sky . these apps make use of the inbuilt kb_computer_hardware in the phone , such as kb_gps kb_location_(sign_language) and kb_gyroscope . useful kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) about the pointed kb_space_debris like kb_celestial_coordinates coordinates , the kb_toponymy of the kb_space_debris , its kb_constellation , etc . are provided for kb_a quick reference . some paid versions give more kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) . these apps are gradually getting into regular use during observing , for the alignment process of kb_optical_telescope .kb_setting_circles circles are kb_angular_measurement measurement kb_fish_scale that can kb_beryllium placed on the kb_2_(number) main kb_rotation_around_a_fixed_axis of some kb_optical_telescope . since the widespread adoption of kb_digital_data kb_setting_circles circles , any kb_classical_conditioning engraved setting kb_circle is now specifically kb_interpretatio_graeca as an `` kb_analog_device setting kb_circle '' ( asc ) . by knowing the coordinates of an kb_space_debris ( usually given in kb_equatorial_coordinates coordinates ) , the kb_telescope kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) can use the setting kb_circle to align ( i.e. , point ) the kb_telescope in the appropriate direction before looking through its kb_eyepiece . kb_a computerized setting kb_circle is called kb_a `` kb_digital_data setting kb_circle ''

computers ( commercial names include kb_argo navis , kb_sky commander , and ngc max ) contain databases of tens of thousands of celestial kb_object_relations_theory and projections of kb_planet positions .to find kb_a celestial kb_space_debris in kb_a kb_telescope equipped with kb_a dsc kb_apollo_guidance_computer , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) does not need to kb_look_(american_magazine) up the specific kb_radium and kb_declination coordinates in kb_a book or kb_other_(philosophy) resource , and then adjust the kb_telescope to those numerical readings . rather , the kb_space_debris is chosen from the kb_electronic_computer database , which kb_causes_of_autism kb_distance values and kb_arrow_(weapon) markers to appear in the kb_computer_monitor that indicate the kb_distance and direction to move the kb_telescope . the kb_telescope is moved until the kb_2_(number) angular kb_distance values reach kb_0_(number) , indicating that the kb_telescope is properly aligned . when both the kb_radium and kb_declination axes are thus `` zeroed out '' , the kb_space_debris should kb_beryllium in the kb_eyepiece . many dscs , like go-to kb_systems_analysis , can also kb_cold_working in

`` kb_epoch_(astronomy) '' year , which refers to the positions of celestial kb_object_relations_theory at kb_a given kb_time_(magazine) to the nearest year ( e.g. , j2005 , j2007 ) . most such printed sources have been updated for intervals of only about every fifty years ( e.g. , j1900 , j1950 , j2000 ) . computerized sources , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , are able to calculate the kb_right_ascension and kb_declination of the `` kb_epoch_(astronomy) of date '' to the exact instant of kb_observation .goto kb_optical_telescope have become more popular since the 1980s as kb_technology has improved and prices have been kb_redox . with these computer-driven kb_optical_telescope , the kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) typically enters the kb_toponymy of the item of kb_interest and the kb_mechanics of the kb_telescope point the kb_telescope towards that item automatically . they have several notable advantages for amateur astronomers intent on kb_research . for example , goto kb_optical_telescope tend to kb_beryllium faster for locating items of kb_interest than kb_star hopping , allowing more kb_time_(magazine) for studying of the kb_space_debris . goto also allows manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler alt-azimuth kb_telescope mounts , allowing them to produce an overall less expensive kb_decay_product . goto kb_optical_telescope usually have to kb_beryllium kb_calibration using alignment stars in kb_order_(biology) to provide accurate tracking and positioning . however , several kb_telescope manufacturers have recently kb_adaptation kb_telescope kb_systems_analysis that are kb_calibration with the use of built-in kb_gps , decreasing the kb_time_(magazine) kb_it takes to kb_set_(mythology) up kb_a kb_telescope at the start of an observing session .with the development of fast kb_internet in the last part of the 20th century along with advances in kb_apollo_guidance_computer controlled kb_telescope mounts and kb_charge-coupled_device cameras `` remote kb_telescope '' kb_astronomy is now kb_a viable means for amateur astronomers not aligned with kb_major_(united_states) kb_telescope facilities to partake in kb_research and deep kb_sky imaging . this enables anyone to control kb_a kb_telescope kb_a great kb_distance away in kb_a dark kb_location_(sign_language) . the observer can image through the kb_telescope using kb_charge-coupled_device cameras . the kb_digital_data kb_big_data collected by the kb_telescope is then transmitted and displayed to the kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) by means of kb_the_internet kb_internet . an example of kb_a kb_digital_data remote kb_telescope operation for kb_public_domain_(land) via kb_the_internet kb_internet is the kb_bareket_observatory observatory , and there are kb_telescope farms in kb_new_mexico , kb_australia and kb_atacama_desert#astronomical_observatories in kb_chile .amateur astronomers engage in many imaging techniques including kb_film , kb_dslr , kb_lrgb , and kb_charge-coupled_device kb_astrophotography . because kb_charge-coupled_device imagers are kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history , kb_image_processing kb_fish_processingkb_scientific_method kb_research is most often not the `` main '' goal for many amateur astronomers , unlike professional astronomers . kb_cold_working of kb_scientific_method merit is possible , however , and many kb_amateurs successfully contribute to the kb_knowledge_representation kb_base_(chemistry) of professional astronomers . kb_astronomy is sometimes promoted as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the few remaining kb_sciences for which kb_amateurs can still contribute useful kb_big_data . to recognize this , the kb_astronomical_society_of_the_pacific of the kb_pacific_ocean annually gives kb_amateur_achievement_award_of_astronomical_society_of_the_pacific achievement awards for significant contributions to kb_astronomy by kb_amateurs .the majority of kb_scientific_method contributions by amateur astronomers are in the kb_area of kb_big_data kb_class_(set_theory) . in kb_particular , this applies where kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of amateur astronomers with small kb_optical_telescope are more effective than the relatively small kb_grammatical_number of kb_prespa_lake kb_optical_telescope that are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance to professional astronomers . several organizations , such as the kb_american_association_of_variable_star_observers of kb_variable_star kb_star observers , exist to help kb_coordinate these contributions .amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of kb_variable_stars stars and kb_supernovae , helping to track kb_asteroids , and observing occultations to determine both the kb_shape of kb_asteroids and the kb_shape of the kb_terrain_(journal) on the apparent kb_enhanced_data_rates_for_gsm_evolution of the kb_moon as seen from kb_earth . with more advanced equipment , but still cheap in comparison to professional setups , amateur astronomers can kb_measure_(mathematics) the kb_light kb_visible_spectrum emitted from kb_astronomical kb_object_relations_theory , which can yield high-quality kb_scientific_method kb_big_data if the measurements are performed with due care . kb_a relatively recent role for amateur astronomers is searching for overlooked kb_phenomenon ( e.g. , kb_kreutz_sungrazers sungrazers ) in the vast libraries of kb_digital_data images and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_big_data captured by kb_earth and kb_space based kb_observatory , much of which is kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance over kb_the_internet kb_internet .in the kb_past and present , amateur astronomers have played kb_a kb_major_(united_states) role in discovering kb_new_world comets . recently however , funding of projects such as the kb_linear kb_asteroid kb_research and kb_near_earth_asteroid_tracking kb_earth kb_asteroid tracking projects has meant that most comets are now discovered by kb_automated kb_systems_analysis kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) before kb_it is possible for kb_amateurs to kb_episcopal_see them .there are kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of amateur kb_astronomical_society around the kb_world_war_ii , that serve as kb_a meeting point for those interested in kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy . members range from active observers with their own equipment to `` armchair astronomers '' kb_world_health_organization are simply interested in the kb_topic_(linguistics) . kb_society range widely in their goals and activities , which may depend on kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of factors such as geographic kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) , local circumstances , size , and membership . for example , kb_a small local society located in dark countryside may focus on practical observing and kb_star_parties , whereas kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) based in kb_a kb_major_(united_states) kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey might have numerous members but kb_beryllium limited by kb_light_pollution and thus hold regular indoor meetings with guest kb_appledesign_powered_speakers instead . kb_major_(united_states) national or international kb_society generally publish their own kb_academic_journal or kb_newsletter , and some hold kb_prespa_lake multi-day meetings akin to kb_a

entering ) , and kb_tenkan ( turning ) movements ( that redirect the opponent 's attack kb_momentum ) , various types of kb_throw_(grappling) and joint locks .aikido derives mainly from the kb_martial_art kb_art of kb_daitō-ryū_aiki-jūjutsu aiki-jūjutsu , but began to diverge from kb_it in the late 1920s , partly due to ueshiba 's involvement with the kb_oomotokb_the_word_(free_love) word `` aikido '' is formed of kb_triliteral kb_kanji :the kb_terminology `` kb_aiki_(martial_arts_principle) '' does not readily appear in the kb_japanese_film kb_hunnic_language outside the kb_scope_(mouthwash) of kb_budō . this has kb_light-emitting_diode to many possible interpretations of kb_the_word_(free_love) word .the kb_terminology is also found in kb_martial_arts kb_arts such as kb_judo and kb_kendo , and in various non-martial kb_arts , such as kb_japanese_calligraphy ( ) , kb_ikebana ( ) and kb_japanese_tea_ceremonyueshiba kb_adaptation aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older kb_martial_arts kb_arts that kb_he_(letter) had studied . the core kb_martial_art kb_art from which aikido derives is kb_daitō-ryū_aiki-jūjutsu aiki-jūjutsu , which ueshiba studied directly with kb_takeda_sōkaku sōkaku , the reviver of that kb_art . additionally , ueshiba is known to have studied kb_tenjin_shinyo_ryu shin'yō-ryū with tozawa tokusaburō in kb_tokyo in 1901 , kb_yagyū_shingan-ryū yagyū shingan-ryū under nakai masakatsu in kb_sakai,_osaka from 1903 to 1908 , and kb_judo with kiyoichi takagi ( , 1894–1972 ) in kb_tanabe in kb_1911_in_argentine_football .the kb_art of daitō-ryū is the kb_primary_education technical influence on aikido . along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques , ueshiba incorporated kb_military_education_and_training movements with weapons , such as those for the kb_spear ( ) , short kb_stick_fighting ( ) , and perhaps the . however , aikido derives much of its technical kb_structure from the kb_art of swordsmanship ( ) .ueshiba moved to kb_hokkaidōafter ueshiba kb_left-wing_politics kb_hokkaidō in 1919 , kb_he_(letter) kb_methionine and was profoundly influenced by kb_onisaburo_deguchi deguchi , the kb_spirituality kb_leader of the kb_oomoto kb_religion ( kb_a neo-shinto kb_movement_(sign_language) ) in kb_ayabe . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_primary_education features of kb_oomoto is its kb_emphasis_(typography) on the attainment of kb_utopia during kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's kb_life_(magazine) . this was kb_a great influence on ueshiba 's kb_martial_arts kb_arts kb_philosophy of extending kb_love and compassion especially to those kb_world_health_organization seek to harm others . aikido demonstrates this kb_philosophy in its kb_emphasis_(typography) on mastering kb_martial_arts kb_arts kb_sulfate that kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect kb_it . in an kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_optical_resolution , not only is the receiver unharmed , but kb_sulfate is the attacker .in kb_addition to the effect on kb_histidine kb_spirituality growth , the connection with deguchi gave ueshiba kb_azerbaijan_in_the_eurovision_song_contest_2009 to elite kb_politics and kb_military circles as kb_a martial kb_artist . as kb_a result of this exposure , kb_he_(letter) was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students . several of these students would found their own kb_art_movement of aikido .aikido was kb_first_trimester brought to the rest of the kb_world_war_ii in kb_1951_in_literature by kb_minoru_mochizuki mochizuki with kb_a visit to kb_france where kb_he_(letter) introduced aikido techniques to kb_judo students . kb_he_(letter) was followed by kb_tadashi_abe abe in 1952 , kb_world_health_organization came as the official kb_aikikai_hombu hombu representative , remaining in kb_france for seven years . kb_kenji_tomiki tomiki toured with kb_a delegation of various kb_martial_arts kb_arts through 15 kb_continental_dollar kb_sovereign_state of the united kb_sovereign_state in 1953. later that year , kb_koichi_tohei tohei was sent by kb_aikikai_hombu hombu to kb_hawaii for kb_a full year , where kb_he_(letter) kb_set_(mythology) up several kb_dojo . this trip was followed by several further visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the united kb_sovereign_state . the kb_united_kingdom kb_kingdom_(biology) followed in 1955 ; kb_italy in kb_united_states_presidential_election,_1964 by kb_hiroshi_tada tada ; and kb_germany in 1965 by kb_katsuaki_asai asai . designated `` official delegate for kb_europe and kb_africa '' by morihei ueshiba , kb_masamichi_noro noro arrived in kb_france in september 1961. kb_seiichi_sugano sugano was appointed to introduce aikido to kb_australia in 1965. today there are aikido kb_dojo throughout the kb_world_war_ii .the kb_largest_organisms aikido organization is the kb_aikikai_foundation kb_foundation_(engineering) , which remains under the control of the ueshiba kb_family_(biology) . however , aikido has many kb_art_movement , mostly formed by morihei ueshiba 's kb_major_(united_states) students .the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century independent kb_art_movement to emerge were kb_yoseikan_aikido aikido , begun by kb_minoru_mochizuki mochizuki in 1931 , kb_yoshinkan , founded by kb_gozo_shioda in 1955 , and kb_shodokan_aikido aikido , founded by kb_kenji_tomiki tomiki in 1967. the emergence of these kb_art_movement pre-dated ueshiba 's kb_death and did not cause any kb_major_(united_states) upheavals when they were formalized . kb_shodokan_aikido aikido , however , was controversial , since kb_it introduced kb_a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the kb_spirit of aikido .after ueshiba 's kb_death in 1969 , kb_2_(number) more kb_major_(united_states) kb_art_movement kb_declaration_of_independence_of_albania . significant kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war arose with the departure of the kb_aikikai_hombu_dojo kb_dojo 's kb_tribal_chief instructor kb_koichi_tohei tohei , in 1974. tohei kb_left-wing_politics as kb_a result of kb_a disagreement with the son of the founder , kb_kisshomaru_ueshiba ueshiba , kb_world_health_organization at that kb_time_(magazine) headed the kb_aikikai_foundation kb_foundation_(engineering) . the disagreement was over the proper role of `` kb_qi '' development in regular aikido kb_military_education_and_training . after tohei kb_left-wing_politics , kb_he_(letter) formed kb_histidine own kb_carpel , called kb_shin_shin_toitsu_aikido shin toitsu aikido , and the organization that governs kb_it , the kb_ki_society ( `` kb_qi no kenkyūkai '' ) .kb_a final kb_major_(united_states) kb_carpel kb_evolution_of_tetrapods from ueshiba 's retirement in iwama , ibaraki and the teaching kb_methodology of kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_terminology student kb_morihiro_saito saito . kb_it is unofficially referred to as the `` kb_iwama_style kb_carpel '' , and at kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) point kb_a kb_grammatical_number of its followers formed kb_a loose network of schools they called kb_iwama_ryu ryu . although kb_iwama_style kb_carpel practitioners remained part of the aikikai until saito 's kb_death in kb_2002_australian_open , followers of saito subsequently split into kb_2_(number) kb_group_(mathematics) . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) remained with the aikikai and the kb_other_(philosophy) formed the independent kb_shinshin_aikishuren_kai aikishuren kai in kb_2004_summer_olympics around saito 's son kb_hitohiro_saito saitothe kb_science of `` kb_qi '' is an important component of aikido , and its kb_science defies categorization as either `` kb_health '' or `` kb_mental_health '' kb_military_education_and_training , as kb_it encompasses both . the `` kb_kanji '' for `` kb_qi '' normally is written as . kb_it was written as until the kb_tōyō_kanji reforms after kb_world_war_ii kb_war ii , and this older kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism still is seen on occasion .the kb_character_(computing) for `` kb_qi '' is used in everyday kb_japanese_film terms , such as , or . `` kb_qi '' has many meanings , including `` ambience '' , `` kb_mind '' , `` mood '' , and `` intention '' , however , in traditional kb_martial_arts kb_arts kb_it is often used to refer to `` kb_life_(magazine) kb_energy_industry '' . kb_gozo_shioda shioda 's kb_yoshinkan , considered kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the `` hard kb_art_movement '' , largely follows ueshiba 's teachings from before kb_world_war_ii kb_war ii , and surmises that the secret to `` kb_qi '' lies in timing and the kb_application_(computing) of the whole kb_human_body 's kb_strength_of_materials to kb_a kb_single_bond point . in later years , ueshiba 's kb_application_(computing) of `` kb_qi '' in aikido took on kb_a softer , more gentle kb_sentience . this was kb_histidine kb_takemusu kb_aiki_(martial_arts_principle) and many of kb_histidine later students teach about `` kb_qi '' from this perspective . kb_koichi_tohei tohei 's kb_ki_society centers almost exclusively around the kb_science of the kb_empirical_evidence ( albeit subjective ) experience of `` kb_qi '' with students kb_historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_united_states#scholar_survey_results separately in aikido techniques and `` kb_qi '' development .in aikido , as in virtually all kb_japanese_film kb_martial_arts kb_arts , there are both kb_health and kb_mental_health aspects of kb_military_education_and_training . the kb_health kb_military_education_and_training in aikido is diverse , covering both kb_general_(united_states) kb_health kb_fitness_(biology) and kb_physical_exercise , as kb_water_well as specific techniques . because kb_a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of kb_throw_(grappling) , beginners learn how to safely fall or roll . the specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs ; the techniques for kb_defense_(legal) consist of kb_throw_(grappling) and kb_pinning_holdkb_health kb_military_education_and_training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled kb_relaxation_technique , correct kb_movement_(sign_language) of joints such as hips and shoulders , kb_flexibility_(anatomy) , and kb_endurance , with less kb_emphasis_(typography) on kb_strength_training . in aikido , pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements . this distinction can kb_beryllium kb_applied_science to kb_general_(united_states) kb_fitness_(biology) goals for the aikido practitioner .in aikido , specific muscles or kb_muscle kb_group_(mathematics) are not kb_isolationism and worked to improve kb_tone_(linguistics) , kb_mass_(liturgy) , or kb_power_(physics) . aikido-related kb_military_education_and_training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body kb_movement_(sign_language) and kb_formal_balance similar to kb_yoga or kb_pilates . for example , many dojos begin each kb_class_(biology) with , which may include kb_stretching and kb_uke_(martial_arts) ( break falls ) .aikido kb_military_education_and_training is based primarily on kb_2_(number) partners practicing pre-arranged kb_theory_of_forms ( `` kb_kata '' ) rather than freestyle practice . the kb_base_(chemistry) kb_pattern is for the receiver of the technique ( `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' ) to initiate an attack against the kb_grammatical_person kb_world_health_organization applies the technique—the `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , or `` shite '' ( depending on aikido kb_carpel ) , also referred to as `` nage '' ( when applying kb_a throwing technique ) , kb_world_health_organization neutralises this attack with an aikido technique .both halves of the technique , that of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' and that of `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , are considered kb_essential_element to aikido kb_military_education_and_training . both are studying aikido principles of blending and kb_adaptation . `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' learns to blend with and control attacking kb_energy_industry , while `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous , off-balance positions in which `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' places them . this `` receiving '' of the technique is called `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' . `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' continuously seeks to regain kb_formal_balance and cover vulnerabilities ( e.g. , an exposed side ) , while `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' uses kb_positional_notation and timing to keep `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' off-balance and vulnerable . in more advanced kb_military_education_and_training , `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' kb_will_and_testament sometimes apply to regain kb_formal_balance and pin or kb_throw_(grappling) `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' .aikido techniques are usually kb_a kb_defense_(legal) against an attack , kb_sulfate students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to kb_beryllium able to practice aikido with kb_a partner . although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based kb_arts , sincere attacks ( kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_strike_action or an immobilizing grab ) are needed to kb_science correct and effective kb_application_(computing) of technique .many of the of aikido resemble cuts from kb_a kb_sword or kb_other_(philosophy) grasped kb_space_debris , which indicate its origins in techniques kb_intention for kb_weapon kb_combat_(newspaper) . kb_other_(philosophy) techniques , which explicitly appear to kb_beryllium punches ( `` kb_tsuki '' ) , are practiced as thrusts with kb_a kb_knife or kb_sword . kicks are generally reserved for upper-level variations ; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous , and that kicks ( kb_high_middle_ages kicks in kb_particular ) were uncommon during the types of kb_combat_(newspaper) prevalent in kb_feudal kb_japan . some kb_base_(chemistry) strikes include :beginners in kb_particular often practice techniques from grabs , both because they are safer and because kb_it is easier to kb_sentience the kb_energy_industry and lines of kb_force of kb_a hold than kb_a kb_strike_action . some grabs are kb_history kb_derived_trait from kb_being held while trying to draw kb_a kb_katanaaikido makes use of kb_human_body kb_movement_(sign_language) ( `` kb_tai_sabaki sabaki '' ) to blend with `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' . for example , an `` entering '' ( `` kb_irimi '' ) technique consists of movements inward towards `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , while kb_a technique uses kb_a pivoting kb_motion_(physics) .additionally , an technique takes kb_place_of_articulation in front of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , whereas an technique takes kb_place_of_articulation to their side ; kb_a technique is kb_applied_science with kb_motion_(physics) to the front of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , and kb_a version is kb_applied_science with kb_motion_(physics) towards the rear of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , usually by incorporating kb_a turning or pivoting kb_motion_(physics) . finally , most techniques can kb_beryllium performed while in kb_a seated posture ( `` kb_seiza '' ) . techniques where both `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' and `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' are standing are called `` tachi-waza '' , techniques where both start off in `` kb_seiza '' are called `` suwari-waza '' , and techniques performed with `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' standing and `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' sitting are called `` hanmi handachi '' ( ) .thus , from fewer than twenty kb_base_(chemistry) techniques , there are thousands of possible implementations . for instance , `` ikkyō '' can kb_beryllium kb_applied_science to an opponent moving forward with kb_a kb_strike_action ( perhaps with an `` ura '' kb_type_(biology) of kb_movement_(sign_language) to redirect the incoming kb_force ) , or to an opponent kb_world_health_organization has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish kb_distance ( perhaps an `` omote-waza '' version ) . specific aikido `` kb_kata '' are typically referred to with the kb_chemical_formula `` attack-technique ( -modifier ) '' . for instance , `` katate-dori ikkyō '' refers to any `` ikkyō '' technique kb_execution_(computing) when `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' is holding kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_wrist . this could kb_beryllium further specified as `` katate-dori ikkyō omote '' , referring to any forward-moving `` ikkyō '' technique from that grab .`` kb_atemi '' ( ) are strikes ( or feints ) employed during an aikido technique . some view `` kb_atemi '' as attacks against `` kb_pressure_point points '' meant to cause damage in and of themselves . for instance , kb_gozo_shioda shiodaweapons kb_military_education_and_training in aikido traditionally includes the short kb_stick_fighting ( `` kb_jō '' ) although its techniques resemble closely the use of the bayonet or kb_jūkendō , the wooden kb_sword ( `` kb_bokken '' ) , and the kb_knife ( `` kb_tantō '' ) . some schools incorporate firearm-disarming techniques . both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are taught . some schools , such as the kb_iwama_style kb_carpel of kb_morihiro_saito saito , usually spend substantial kb_time_(magazine) practicing with both `` kb_bokken '' and `` kb_jō '' , under the names of `` kb_aiki-ken '' , and `` kb_aiki-jō '' , respectively .the founder kb_adaptation many of the empty-handed techniques from traditional kb_sword , kb_spear and bayonet movements . consequently , the practice of the weapons kb_arts gives insight into the kb_evolution of techniques and movements , and reinforces the concepts of kb_distance , timing , kb_hiking kb_movement_(sign_language) , presence and connectedness with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's kb_military_education_and_training partner ( kb_sulfur ) .kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_i_shot_andy_warhol of aikido is kb_military_education_and_training to defend against kb_cross-platform_software attackers , often called `` taninzudori '' , or `` taninzugake '' . freestyle practice with kb_cross-platform_software attackers called `` kb_randori '' ( ) is kb_a kb_key_(cryptography) part of most curricula and is required for the higher level ranks . `` kb_randori '' exercises kb_a kb_grammatical_person 's ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment . kb_geostrategy kb_utility of techniques , based on how they reposition the student relative to kb_other_(philosophy) attackers , is important in `` kb_randori '' kb_military_education_and_training . for instance , an `` ura '' technique might kb_beryllium used to neutralise the kb_electric_current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind .in kb_shodokan_aikido aikido , `` kb_randori '' differs in that kb_it is not performed with kb_cross-platform_software persons with kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity roles of kb_defender_(video_game) and attacker , but between kb_2_(number) kb_people_(american_magazine) , where both participants attack , defend , and counter at kb_will_and_testament . in this respect kb_it resembles kb_judo `` kb_randori '' .in applying kb_a technique during kb_military_education_and_training , kb_it is the responsibility of `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' to prevent kb_injury to `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' by employing kb_a speed and kb_force of kb_application_(computing) that is commensurate with their partner 's proficiency in `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' . kb_injuries ( especially those to the joints ) , when they do occur in aikido , are often the result of `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' misjudging the ability of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' to receive the kb_throw_(grappling) or pin .kb_a kb_science of kb_injuries in the kb_martial_arts kb_arts showed that the kb_type_(biology) of kb_injuries varied considerably from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_art to the kb_other_(philosophy) .kb_hardness kb_tissue_(biology) kb_injuries are kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the most common types of kb_injuries found within aikido , as kb_water_well as joint kb_strain_(biology) and stubbed fingers and toes . several kb_maternal_death from head-and-neck kb_injuries , caused by aggressive `` shihōnage '' in kb_a kb_senpai_and_kōhaiaikido practitioners ( commonly called `` aikidōka '' outside kb_japan ) generally progress by promotion through kb_a series of `` kb_grade_(education) '' ( `` kb_kyū '' ) , followed by kb_a series of `` kb_degree_(angle) '' ( `` kb_dan_(rank) '' ) , pursuant to formal testing procedures . some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners ' kb_grade_(education) , often simply kb_white_american and kb_black_belt_(martial_arts) to distinguish `` kyu '' and `` kb_dan_(rank) '' kb_grade_(education) , though some use various belt colors . testing kb_requirement_analysis vary , kb_sulfate kb_a kb_particular rank in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another . some dojos do not allow students to kb_take the test to obtain kb_a `` kb_dan_(rank) '' rank unless they are 16 or older .the uniform worn for practicing aikido ( `` kb_aikidogi '' ) is similar to the kb_military_education_and_training uniform ( `` kb_keikogi '' ) used in most kb_other_(philosophy) kb_modern_history kb_martial_arts kb_arts ; kb_simple_polygon trousers and kb_a wraparound jacket , usually kb_white_american . both thick ( `` judo-style '' ) , and thin ( `` karate-style '' ) kb_cotton tops are used . aikido-specific tops are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance with shorter sleeves which reach to just kb_#ecclesiastical_history the kb_elbow_river .most aikido kb_systems_analysis add kb_a pair of wide pleated kb_black_sea or kb_indigo trousers called kb_a `` kb_hakama '' ( used also in kb_naginatajutsu , kb_kendo , and kb_iaido ) . in many schools , its use is reserved for practitioners with ( `` kb_dan_(rank) '' ) ranks or for instructors , while others allow all practitioners to wear kb_a `` kb_hakama '' regardless of rank .the most common criticism of aikido is that kb_it suffers from kb_a lack of kb_metaphysical_realism in kb_military_education_and_training . the attacks initiated by `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' ( and which `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' must defend against ) have been criticized as kb_being `` weak '' , `` sloppy '' , and `` little more than caricatures of an attack '' .weak attacks from `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' allow for kb_a conditioned response from `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners . to counteract this , some kb_art_movement allow students to become less compliant over kb_time_(magazine) but , in keeping with the core philosophies , this is after having demonstrated proficiency in kb_being able to protect themselves and their kb_military_education_and_training partners . kb_shodokan_aikido aikido addresses the issue by practising in kb_a competitive kb_text_formatting . such adaptations are debated between kb_art_movement , with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified , or that they are not kb_military_education_and_training for self-defense or kb_combat_(newspaper) effectiveness , but kb_spirituality , kb_fitness_(biology) or kb_other_(philosophy) reasons .another criticism pertains to the kb_shift_code in kb_military_education_and_training focus after the end of ueshiba 's seclusion in iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s , as kb_he_(letter) increasingly emphasized the kb_spirituality and kb_philosophy aspects of aikido . as kb_a result , strikes to kb_pressure_point points by `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , entering ( `` kb_irimi '' ) and initiation of techniques by `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , the distinction between `` omote '' ( front side ) and `` ura '' ( back side ) techniques , and the use of weapons , were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice . some aikido practitioners kb_sentience that lack of kb_military_education_and_training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness .conversely , some kb_art_movement of aikido receive criticism for not placing enough importance on the kb_spirituality practices emphasized by ueshiba . according to minoru shibata of aikido kb_academic_journal , `` o-sensei 's aikido was not kb_a continuation and kb_extension_(kinesiology) of the kb_old_testament and has kb_a distinct discontinuity with kb_past martial and kb_philosophy concepts . '' that is , that aikido practitioners kb_world_health_organization focus on aikido 's kb_semitic_root in traditional `` kb_jujutsu '' or `` kb_kenjutsucategory : kb_japanese_film kb_martial_arts kb_artscategory : dōcategory : kb_article_(grammar) containing kb_video kb_clips_(software)kb_art is kb_a diverse range of kb_human_behavior in creating visual , auditory or performing kb_artifact_(archaeology) ( kb_artworks ) , expressing the author 's kb_imagination , kb_concept kb_idea , or technical skill , kb_intention to kb_beryllium appreciated for their kb_beauty or emotional kb_power_(physics) . in their most kb_general_(united_states) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism these activities include the production of works of kb_art , the criticism of kb_art , the kb_science of the kb_history of kb_art , and the kb_aesthetic dissemination of kb_art .the kb_triliteral kb_classical_conditioning kb_branches_of_science of kb_art are kb_painting , kb_sculpture and kb_architecture . kb_music , kb_theatre , kb_film , kb_dance , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_performing_arts kb_arts , as kb_water_well as kb_ancient_egyptian_literature and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_medes such as kb_interactive_media kb_medes , are included in kb_a broader kb_definition of kb_the_arts kb_arts . until the 17th century , `` kb_art '' referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or kb_sciences . in kb_modern_history usage after the 17th century , where kb_aesthetic considerations are paramount , the kb_fine_(penalty) kb_arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in kb_general_(united_states) , such as the kb_decorative_art or kb_applied_arts .though the kb_definition of what constitutes kb_art is disputed and has changed over kb_time_(magazine) , kb_general_(united_states) descriptions mention an idea of kb_imagination or technical skill stemming from kb_agency_(philosophy) and creation . the kb_nature of kb_art and related concepts , such as creativity and kb_interpretation_(logic) , are explored in kb_a branch of kb_philosophy known as kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics .in the perspective of the kb_history of kb_art , artistic works have existed for almost as kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) as humankind : from early kb_pre-historic_art kb_art to contemporary kb_art ; however , some kb_theories restrict the kb_concept of `` artistic works '' to kb_modern_history kb_western_esotericism kb_society . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) early kb_word_sense of the kb_definition of `` kb_art '' is closely related to the older kb_latin kb_meaning_(linguistics) , which roughly translates to `` skill '' or `` kb_craft , '' as associated with kb_lexical_semantics such as `` kb_artisan . '' kb_australian_english kb_lexical_semantics kb_derived_trait from this kb_meaning_(linguistics) include `` artifact '' , `` artificial '' , `` artifice '' , `` kb_medical_abortion kb_arts '' , and `` kb_military kb_arts '' . however , there are many kb_other_(philosophy) colloquial uses of kb_the_word_(free_love) word , all with some relation to its kb_etymologyover kb_time_(magazine) , kb_philosopher like kb_plato , kb_aristotle , kb_socrates and kb_immanuel_kant , among others , questioned the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of kb_art . several dialogues in kb_plato tackle questions about kb_art : kb_socrates says that kb_poetry is inspired by the kb_muses , and is not kb_rational_number . kb_he_(letter) speaks approvingly of this , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_theory_of_forms of kb_divinity madness ( drunkenness , eroticism , and dreaming ) in the `` kb_phaedrus_(plato) `` ( 265a–c ) , and yet in the `` '' kb_republic '' '' wants to kb_outlaw kb_homer 's great kb_poetic_edda kb_art , and laughter as kb_water_well . in `` kb_ion '' , kb_socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of kb_homer that kb_he_(letter) expresses in the `` kb_republic '' . the kb_dialogue `` kb_ion '' suggests that kb_homer 's `` kb_iliad '' functioned in the kb_ancient_greek kb_world_war_ii as the kb_bible does today in the kb_modern_history kb_christianity kb_world_war_ii : as divinely inspired literary kb_art that can provide kb_morality guidance , if only kb_it can kb_beryllium properly interpreted .with regards to the literary kb_art and the musical kb_arts , kb_aristotle considered kb_epic_poetry , tragedy , comedy , kb_dithyramb kb_poetry and kb_music to kb_beryllium kb_mimesis or imitative kb_art , each varying in imitation by kb_list_of_art_mediums , kb_space_debris , and manner . for example , kb_music imitates with the kb_medes of kb_rhythm and kb_harmony , whereas kb_dance imitates with kb_rhythm alone , and kb_poetry with kb_hunnic_language . the kb_theory_of_forms also differ in their kb_space_debris of imitation . comedy , for instance , is kb_a dramatic imitation of men worse than average ; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average . lastly , the kb_theory_of_forms differ in their manner of imitation—through kb_narrative or kb_character_(computing) , through change or no change , and through drama or no drama . kb_aristotle believed that imitation is kb_natural_number to mankind and constitutes kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of mankind 's advantages over kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing .the kb_second_language , and more recent , kb_word_sense of kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_art '' as an abbreviation for `` kb_creativity kb_art '' or `` kb_fine_art '' kb_declaration_of_independence_of_albania in the early 17th century . kb_fine_art refers to kb_a skill used to express the kb_artist 's creativity , or to engage the audience 's kb_aesthetic sensibilities , or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or `` finer '' kb_cold_working of kb_art .within this latter kb_word_sense , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_art '' may refer to several things : ( kb_iodine ) kb_a kb_science of kb_a kb_creativity skill , ( ii ) kb_a process of using the kb_creativity skill , ( iii ) kb_a kb_decay_product of the kb_creativity skill , or ( iv ) the audience 's experience with the kb_creativity skill . the kb_creativity kb_arts ( `` kb_art '' as discipline ) are kb_a kb_class_(set_theory) of disciplines which produce `` kb_artworks '' ( `` kb_art '' as kb_object_relations_theory ) that are compelled by kb_a kb_personal_property drive ( kb_art as activity ) and convey kb_a message , mood , or kb_symbolism_(arts) for the perceiver to interpret ( kb_art as experience ) . kb_art is something that stimulates an kb_individual 's thoughts , emotions , kb_orthodoxy , or kb_idea through the senses . works of kb_art can kb_beryllium explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of images or kb_object_relations_theory . for some scholars , such as kb_immanuel_kant , the kb_sciences and kb_the_arts kb_arts could kb_beryllium distinguished by taking kb_science as representing the domain of kb_knowledge_representation and kb_the_arts kb_arts as representing the domain of the kb_freedom of artistic expression .often , if the skill is kb_being used in kb_a common or practical way , kb_people_(american_magazine) kb_will_and_testament consider kb_it kb_a kb_craft instead of kb_art . likewise , if the skill is kb_being used in kb_a commercial or industrial way , kb_it may kb_beryllium considered kb_commercial_art kb_art instead of kb_fine_art . on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , crafts and design are sometimes considered kb_applied_art . some kb_art followers have argued that the difference between kb_fine_art and kb_applied_art has more to do with kb_lightness judgments made about the kb_art than any clear definitional difference . however , even kb_fine_art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression . the purpose of works of kb_art may kb_beryllium to communicate kb_idea , such as in kb_politics_of_albania , spiritually , or philosophically motivated kb_art ; to create kb_a kb_word_sense of kb_beauty ( kb_episcopal_see kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics ) ; to explore the kb_nature of kb_machine_perception ; for kb_pleasure ; or to generate kb_strong_nuclear_force emotions . the purpose may also kb_beryllium seemingly nonexistent .the kb_nature of kb_art has been described by kb_philosophy kb_richard_wollheim wollheim as `` kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the most elusive of the traditional kb_problems_(aristotle) of kb_human kb_albanian_culture '' . kb_art has been kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as kb_a kb_space_vehicle for the expression or kb_communication of emotions and kb_idea , kb_a means for kb_exploring and appreciating kb_formalism_(art) kb_chemical_element for their own sake , and as `` kb_mimesis '' or kb_representation_(arts) . kb_art as kb_mimesis has deep kb_semitic_root in the kb_philosophy of kb_aristotle . kb_leo_tolstoy tolstoy kb_interpretatio_graeca kb_art as kb_a use of indirect means to communicate from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_person to another . kb_benedetto_croce croce and r.g . collingwood advanced the kb_idealism view that kb_art expresses emotions , and that the kb_cold_working of kb_art therefore essentially exists in the kb_mind of the creator . the kb_theory of kb_art as kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism has its kb_semitic_root in the kb_philosophy of kb_immanuel_kant , and was kb_adaptation in the early twentieth century by kb_roger_fry fry and kb_clive_bell kb_bell . more recently , thinkers influenced by kb_martin_heidegger heidegger have interpreted kb_art as the means by which kb_a kb_community develops for itself kb_a kb_list_of_art_mediums for self-expression and kb_interpretation_(logic) . kb_george_dickie_(philosopher) has offered an kb_institutional_theory_of_art kb_theory of kb_art that defines kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art as any artifact upon which kb_a qualified kb_grammatical_person or persons acting on behalf of the kb_social_anarchism institution commonly referred to as `` the kb_art_world '' has conferred `` the status of candidate for appreciation '' . larry shiner has described kb_fine_art as `` not an kb_essence or kb_a fate but something we have made . kb_art as we have generally understood kb_it is kb_a kb_european_eel invention barely kb_2_(number) hundred years kb_old_testament .

kb_first_trimester kb_record_(computer_science) of how artists worked . for example , this period of kb_ancient_greek kb_art saw kb_a veneration of the kb_human kb_health kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism and the development of kb_cognate skills to show musculature , poise , kb_beauty , and anatomically correct proportions .in kb_byzantine_empire and

furthermore , the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue kb_it is now more appropriate to think in terms of kb_a kb_globalization kb_albanian_culture , rather than of kb_regional_power ones .in `` kb_the_origin_of_the_work_of_art kb_evolution of the kb_cold_working of kb_art '' , kb_martin_heidegger heideggerthe kb_creativity kb_arts are often divided into more specific categories , typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as kb_medes , kb_genre , kb_art_movement , and kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . kb_art kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism refers to the kb_elements_of_art kb_art that are independent of its kb_interpretation_(logic) or kb_importance . kb_it kb_cover_version the methods kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by the kb_artist and the kb_health kb_function_composition of the artwork , primarily non-semantic aspects of the kb_cold_working ( i.e. , kb_figurae ) , such as kb_color , kb_contour_drawing , kb_dimension , kb_list_of_art_mediums , kb_melody , kb_space , kb_texture_(painting) , and kb_lightness . kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism may also include kb_visual_design_elements_and_principles#principles_of_design design principles , such as arrangement , kb_formal_balance , kb_contrast_(vision) , kb_emphasis_(typography) , kb_harmony , kb_hierarchical_proportion , kb_principles_of_grouping , and kb_rhythm .in kb_general_(united_states) there are kb_triliteral schools of kb_philosophy regarding kb_art , focusing respectively on kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , content , and kb_context_(language_use) . extreme kb_formalism_(art) is the view that all kb_aesthetic kb_chemical_property of kb_art are formal ( that is , part of the kb_art kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism ) . kb_philosopher almost kb_universal_reconciliation reject this view and hold that the kb_chemical_property and kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics of kb_art extend beyond materials , techniques , and kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . unfortunately , there is little consensus on terminology for these informal kb_chemical_property . some authors refer to kb_grammatical_subject kb_matter and content – i.e. , denotations and connotations – while others prefer terms like kb_meaning_(linguistics) and kb_importance .extreme intentionalism holds that kb_authorial_intent intent kb_play_(theatre) kb_a decisive role in the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art , conveying the content or kb_essential_element main idea , while all kb_other_(philosophy) interpretations can kb_beryllium discarded . kb_it defines the kb_grammatical_subject as the persons or idea represented , and the content as the kb_artist 's experience of that kb_grammatical_subject . for example , the kb_function_composition of kb_napoleon_i_on_his_imperial_throne on kb_histidine kb_ottoman_empire throne is partly kb_loanword from the kb_statue_of_zeus_at_olympia kb_zeus at kb_olympia_(manet) . as evidenced by the kb_title , the kb_grammatical_subject is kb_napoleon , and the content is kb_jean-auguste-dominique_ingres 's kb_representation_(arts) of kb_napoleon as `` emperor-god beyond kb_time_(magazine) and kb_space '' . similarly to extreme kb_formalism_(art) , kb_philosopher typically reject extreme intentionalism , because kb_art may have kb_cross-platform_software ambiguous meanings and kb_authorial_intent intent may kb_beryllium kb_uncertainty and thus irrelevant . its restrictive kb_interpretation_(logic) is `` socially unhealthy , philosophically unreal , and kb_politics_of_albania unwise '' .finally , the developing kb_theory of kb_post-structuralism studies kb_art 's kb_importance in kb_a

kb_redox to the kb_artist 's techniques and intentions , in which case kb_analysis proceeds along lines similar to kb_formalism_(art) and intentionalism . however , in kb_other_(philosophy)

kb_climate_of_albania and kb_geography . kb_art_criticismkb_art can connote kb_a kb_word_sense of trained ability or mastery of kb_a kb_list_of_art_mediums . kb_art can also simply refer to the

kb_a quality inseparable from kb_art and thus necessary for its success ; for kb_leonardo_da_vinci da vinci , kb_art , neither more nor less than kb_histidine kb_other_(philosophy) endeavors , was kb_a manifestation of skill . kb_rembrandt 's kb_cold_working , now praised for its ephemeral virtues , was most admired by kb_histidine contemporaries for its virtuosity . at the kb_turn_(geometry) of the 20th century , the adroit performances of kb_john_singer_sargent sargent were alternately admired and viewed with kb_skepticism for their kb_manual_(music) kb_fluency , yet at nearly the same

kb_theory_of_forms of kb_art may have been . reproductive methods such as kb_molding_(process) made mass-production easier , and were used to bring high-quality kb_ancient_roman_pottery kb_ancient_egyptian_pottery and kb_ancient_greek tanagra figurines to kb_a very wide market . kb_cylinder_seals were both artistic and practical , and very widely used by what can kb_beryllium loosely

very expensive , but fell steadily in kb_price until by the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations . kb_popular_prints prints of many different

kb_paris , which could kb_beryllium visited for most of the kb_18th_century century . in kb_italy the kb_art kb_tourism_in_angola of the kb_grand_tour tour became kb_a kb_major_(united_states) kb_industry from the kb_renaissance onwards , and governments and cities made efforts to make their kb_key_(cryptography) works accessible . the kb_kingdom_of_great_britain kb_royal_collection kb_class_(set_theory) remains distinct , but kb_prespa_lake donations such as the kb_old_royal_library library were made from kb_it to kb_british_museum kb_british_museum , established in 1753. the kb_uffizi in kb_florence opened entirely as kb_a gallery in 1765 , though this kb_function_(biology) had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants ' offices for kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_time_(magazine) before . the building now kb_dutch_loango-angola by the kb_prado in kb_madrid was built before the kb_french_revolution for the kb_state_school kb_computer_monitor of parts of the royal kb_art kb_class_(set_theory) , and similar royal kb_art_gallery kb_open_standard to the kb_state_school existed in kb_vienna , kb_munich and

kb_france kb_royal_collection kb_class_(set_theory) certainly marked an important stage in the development of kb_state_school access to kb_art , transferring kb_ownership to kb_a kb_roman_republic kb_state_of_matter , but was kb_a continuation of trends already kb_water_well established .most kb_modern_history kb_state_school museums and kb_visual_arts_education programs for children in schools can kb_beryllium traced back to this impulse to have kb_art kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance to everyone . museums in the united kb_sovereign_state tend to kb_beryllium gifts from the very rich to the

of reasons , including kb_religion ones . kb_aniconism is kb_a kb_general_(united_states) dislike of either all figurative images , or often just kb_religion ones , and has been kb_a thread in many

have often been kb_conservative and taken very seriously by kb_art kb_art_critic , though often much less kb_sulfate by kb_a wider kb_state_school . the kb_iconography content of kb_art could cause kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war , as with late kb_medieval_greek depictions of the kb_new_world kb_motif_(visual_arts) of the kb_swoon_of_the_virgin of the virgin in scenes of the kb_crucifixion_of_jesus of kb_jesus . the `` last kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition '' by kb_michelangelo was controversial for various reasons , including breaches of kb_decorum through nudity and the apollo-like pose of kb_jesus_christ .the content of much formal kb_art through kb_history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the kb_artist , but with the kb_advent of kb_romanticism , and kb_economic_anthropology changes in the production of kb_art , the artists ' kb_computer_vision became the usual kb_determinant of the content of kb_histidine kb_art , increasing the incidence of kb_controversies_in_autism , though often kb_redox their kb_importance . kb_strong_nuclear_force incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to kb_court kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war . kb_théodore_géricault géricault 's `` kb_the_raft_of_the_medusa of the kb_medusa '' ( kb_circa 1820 ) , was in part kb_a kb_politics commentary on kb_a recent event . kb_édouard_manet manet 's `` kb_the_luncheon_on_the_grass déjeuner sur l'herbe '' ( 1863 ) , was considered scandalous not because of the kb_nude woman , but because she is seated kb_next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the kb_time_(magazine) , rather than in robes of the antique kb_world_war_ii . kb_john_singer_sargent sargent 's `` madame pierre gautreau ( madam x ) '' ( 1884 ) , caused kb_a kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war over the reddish pink used to kb_color the woman 's kb_ear lobe , considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the

kb_pablo_picasso picasso 's `` kb_guernica_(painting) '' ( 1937 ) used arresting kb_cubism techniques and stark kb_monochrome_painting kb_cooking_oil , to depict the harrowing consequences of kb_a contemporary bombing of kb_a small , kb_ancient_history kb_basque_language town . kb_leon_golub golub 's `` interrogation iii '' ( 1981 ) , depicts kb_a female kb_nude , hooded detainee strapped to

kb_united_states_senate about kb_state_school funding of kb_the_arts kb_arts .before kb_modernism , kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics in kb_art_of_europe was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate kb_formal_balance between different aspects of kb_realism_(arts) kb_truth to kb_nature and the kb_ideal_(ring_theory) ; kb_idea as to what the appropriate kb_formal_balance is have shifted to and fro over the kb_century_(cricket) . this concern is largely absent in kb_other_(philosophy) traditions of kb_art . the kb_aesthetic theorist kb_john_ruskin , kb_world_health_organization championed what kb_he_(letter) saw as the kb_realism_(arts) of j. m. w. kb_j._m._w._turner , saw kb_art 's role as the kb_communication by artifice of an kb_essential_element kb_truth that could only kb_beryllium found in kb_nature .the kb_definition and evaluation of kb_art has become especially problematic since the 20th century . kb_richard_wollheim wollheim distinguishes kb_triliteral approaches to assessing the kb_aesthetic kb_lightness of kb_art : the kb_mathematical_realism , whereby kb_aesthetic quality is an kb_absolute_value independent of any kb_human view ; the kb_objectivity_(philosophy) , whereby kb_it is also an kb_absolute_value , but is dependent on kb_general_(united_states) kb_human experience ; and the kb_relativist kb_positional_notationthe kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_modernism in the late nineteenth century kb_lead to kb_a kb_political_radicalism break in the kb_human_fertilization of the kb_function_(biology) of kb_art , and then again in the late twentieth century with the kb_advent of kb_postmodern_art . kb_clement_greenberg greenberg 's kb_u.s._presidential_election,_1960 article `` modernist kb_painting '' defines kb_modern_art as `` the use of kb_characteristic_(algebra) methods of kb_a discipline to criticize the discipline itself '' . greenberg originally kb_applied_science this idea to the abstract kb_german_expressionism kb_movement_(sign_language) and used kb_it as kb_a way to kb_natural_language_understanding and justify flat ( non-illusionistic ) abstract kb_painting :pop artists like kb_andy_warhol warhol became both noteworthy and influential through kb_cold_working including and possibly critiquing popular kb_albanian_culture , as kb_water_well as the kb_art_world . artists of the 1980s , 1990s , and kb_2000s_in_angola expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond `` kb_high_middle_ages kb_art '' to all kb_cultural_anthropology image-making , including fashion images , comics , billboards and pornography .kb_duchamp once kb_anatolian_hypothesis that kb_art is any activity of any kind- everything . however , the way that only certain activities are classified today as kb_art is kb_a kb_social_anarchism kb_construction . there is kb_evidence_(law) that there may kb_beryllium an kb_chemical_element of kb_truth to this . `` the invention of kb_art : kb_a kb_cultural_anthropology kb_history '' is an kb_art_history book which examines the kb_construction of the kb_modern_history system of kb_the_arts kb_arts i.e . kb_fine_art . shiner finds kb_evidence_(law) that the older system of kb_the_arts kb_arts before our kb_modern_history system ( kb_fine_art ) held kb_art to kb_beryllium any skilled kb_human activity i.e . kb_ancient_greek society did not possess the kb_terminology kb_art but kb_techne . kb_techne can kb_beryllium understood neither as kb_art or kb_craft , the kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving kb_being that the kb_aspect_ratio_(image)#distinctions of kb_art and kb_craft are historical products that came later on in kb_human kb_history . kb_techne included kb_painting , sculpting and kb_music but also ; cooking , kb_medicine , kb_horsemanship , kb_geometry , kb_carpentry , kb_prophecy , and farming etc .following kb_duchamp during the kb_first_trimester half of the twentieth century , kb_a significant kb_shift_code to kb_general_(united_states) kb_aesthetic kb_theory took kb_place_of_articulation which attempted to apply kb_aesthetic kb_theory between various kb_theory_of_forms of kb_art , including the literary kb_arts and the kb_visual_arts kb_arts , to each kb_other_(philosophy) . this resulted in the rise of kb_the_new_criticism kb_new_criticism kb_school and kb_abortion_debate concerning `` kb_intentional_fallacy intentional fallacy '' . at issue was the kb_question of whether the kb_aesthetic intentions of the kb_artist in creating the kb_cold_working of kb_art , whatever its specific kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , should kb_beryllium associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final kb_decay_product of the kb_cold_working of kb_art , or , if the kb_cold_working of kb_art should kb_beryllium evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the kb_artist .in 1946 , kb_w._k._wimsatt k. wimsatt and kb_monroe_beardsley beardsley published kb_a classic and controversial kb_new_world critical essay entitled `` kb_intentional_fallacy intentional fallacy '' , in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author 's intention , or `` kb_intention kb_meaning_(linguistics) '' in the kb_analysis of kb_a literary kb_cold_working . for wimsatt and beardsley , the kb_lexical_semantics on the page were all that mattered ; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant , and potentially distracting .in another essay , `` kb_affective_fallacy affective fallacy , '' which served as kb_a kind of sister essay to `` kb_intentional_fallacy intentional fallacy '' wimsatt and beardsley also discounted the kb_reader_(academic_rank) 's personal/emotional reaction to kb_a literary kb_cold_working as kb_a valid means of analyzing kb_a text . this fallacy would later kb_beryllium repudiated by theorists from the kb_reader-response kb_school of literary kb_theory . ironically , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the leading theorists from this kb_school , kb_stanley_fish kb_fish , was himself trained by kb_new_world kb_art_critic . kb_fish criticizes wimsatt and beardsley in kb_histidine essay `` kb_ancient_egyptian_literature in the kb_reader_(academic_rank) '' ( 1970 ) .as summarized by gaut and livingston in their essay `` the creation of kb_art '' : `` kb_structuralism and post-structuralists theorists and kb_art_critic were sharply critical of many aspects of kb_new_criticism , beginning with the kb_emphasis_(typography) on kb_aesthetic appreciation and the so-called kb_self-governance of kb_art , but they reiterated the attack on kb_biographical_film criticisms 's assumption that the kb_artist 's activities and experience were kb_a privileged critical kb_topic_(linguistics) . '' these authors contend that : `` anti-intentionalists , such as formalists , hold that the intentions involved in the making of kb_art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting kb_art . kb_sulfate details of the act of creating kb_a kb_cold_working , though possibly of kb_interest in themselves , have no bearing on the correct kb_interpretation_(logic) of the kb_cold_working . ''gaut and livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that : `` intentionalists , unlike formalists , hold that reference to intentions is kb_essential_element in fixing the correct kb_interpretation_(logic) of works . '' they quote kb_richard_wollheim wollheim as stating that , `` the task of criticism is the kb_reconstruction_era of the kb_creativity process , where the kb_creativity process must in kb_turn_(geometry) kb_beryllium thought of as something not stopping short of , but terminating on , the kb_cold_working of kb_art itself . ''the end of the 20th century fostered an extensive kb_abortion_debate known as the kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_turn_(geometry) kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war , or the `` innocent kb_human_eye kb_abortion_debate '' , and generally referred to as the structuralism-poststructuralism kb_abortion_debate in the kb_philosophy of kb_art . this kb_abortion_debate discussed the encounter of the kb_cold_working of kb_art as kb_being determined by the relative extent to which the kb_concept encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art .decisive for the kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_turn_(geometry) kb_abortion_debate in kb_art_history and the kb_humanities were the works of yet another kb_tradition , namely the kb_structuralism of kb_ferdinand_de_saussure kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann saussure and the ensuing kb_movement_(sign_language) of kb_poststructuralism . in 1981 , the kb_artist kb_mark_tansey created kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art titled `` the innocent kb_human_eye '' as kb_a criticism of the prevailing kb_climate_of_albania of disagreement in the kb_philosophy of kb_art during the closing decades of the 20th century . influential theorists include kb_judith_butler butler , kb_luce_irigaray irigaray , kb_julia_kristeva , kb_michel_foucault kb_léon_foucault and kb_jacques_derrida derrida . the kb_power_(physics) of kb_hunnic_language , more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes , in kb_art_history and historical kb_discourse was explored by kb_hayden_white kb_white_american . the kb_fact that kb_hunnic_language is `` not '' kb_a transparent kb_list_of_art_mediums of thought had been stressed by kb_a very different kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_philosophy_of_language kb_hunnic_language which originated in the works of kb_johann_georg_hamann georg hamann and kb_wilhelm_von_humboldt von humboldt . kb_ernst_gombrich gombrich and kb_nelson_goodman goodman in kb_histidine book `` languages of kb_art : an approach to kb_a kb_theory of kb_symbols '' came to hold that the kb_concept encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art during the kb_1960s_in_the_united_states and 1970s . kb_he_(letter) was challenged on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of kb_research done by the kb_nobel_prize prize winning psychologist kb_roger_sperry sperry kb_world_health_organization maintained that the kb_human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in kb_hunnic_language alone ( the kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_turn_(geometry) ) and that kb_other_(philosophy) kb_theory_of_forms of kb_psychology representations of the kb_cold_working of kb_art were equally defensible and demonstrable . sperry 's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with kb_aesthetic kb_philosopher such as kb_nick_zangwill zangwill disputes as to whether or not to classify something as kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art are referred to as classificatory disputes about kb_art . classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included kb_cubism and kb_impressionist paintings , kb_duchamp 's `` kb_fountain_(duchamp) '' , the movies , superlative imitations of kb_j._s._g._boggs , kb_conceptual_art , and kb_video_games . kb_philosophy kb_jacques-louis_david novitz has argued that disagreement about the kb_definition of kb_art are rarely the kb_heart of the problem . rather , `` the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their kb_social_anarchism kb_life_(magazine) '' are `` kb_sulfate much kb_a part of all classificatory disputes about kb_art '' ( novitz , 1996 ) . according to novitz , classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to kb_go_(game) than they are about kb_theory proper . for example , when the `` kb_daily_mail kb_airmail '' criticized kb_damien_hirst 's and kb_tracey_emin 's kb_cold_working by arguing `` for 1,000 years kb_art has been kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of our great civilising kb_afsharid_dynasty . today , pickled kb_sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) all '' they are not advancing kb_a kb_definition or kb_theory about kb_art , but questioning the kb_lightness of kb_damien_hirst 's and kb_tracey_emin 's kb_cold_working . in kb_1998_nrl_season , kb_arthur_danto , suggested kb_a kb_einstein's_thought_experiments kb_experiment showing that `` the status of an artifact as kb_cold_working of kb_art results from the kb_idea kb_a kb_albanian_culture applies to kb_it , rather than its inherent kb_health or perceptible qualities . kb_cultural_anthropology kb_interpretation_(logic) ( an kb_art kb_theory of some kind ) is therefore constitutive of an kb_space_debris 's arthood . ''kb_anti-art is kb_a label for kb_art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of kb_art ; kb_it is kb_terminology associated with kb_dadaism and attributed to kb_marcel_duchamp kb_duchamp just before kb_world_war_ii kb_war kb_iodine , when kb_he_(letter) was making kb_art from kb_found_art kb_object_relations_theory . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of these , `` kb_fountain_(duchamp) '' ( 1917 ) , an kb_ordinary_(officer) urinal , has achieved considerable kb_topographic_prominence and influence on kb_art . kb_anti-art is kb_a kb_i_shot_andy_warhol of kb_cold_working by kb_situationist_international international , the lo-fi kb_airmail kb_art_movement , and the kb_young_british_artists artists , though kb_it is kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism still rejected by the kb_stuckism , kb_world_health_organization describe themselves as kb_anti-anti-art .kb_architecture is often included as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_visual_arts kb_arts ; however , like the kb_decorative_artssomewhat in relation to the above , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_art '' is also used to apply judgments of kb_lightness , as in such expressions as `` that meal was kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art '' ( the cook is an kb_artist ) , or `` the kb_art of deception '' , ( the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised ) . kb_it is this use of kb_the_word_(free_love) word as kb_a kb_measure_(mathematics) of kb_high_middle_ages quality and kb_high_middle_ages kb_lightness that gives the kb_terminology its kb_flavor of subjectivity . making judgments of kb_lightness requires kb_a kb_basis_(linear_algebra) for criticism . at the simplest level , kb_a way to determine whether the impact of the kb_space_debris on the senses meets the criteria to kb_beryllium considered `` kb_art '' is whether kb_it is perceived to kb_beryllium attractive or repulsive . though kb_machine_perception is always colored by experience , and is necessarily subjective , kb_it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying can not kb_beryllium kb_art . however , `` good '' kb_art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to kb_a majority of viewers . in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_lexical_semantics , an kb_artist 's kb_prime_(symbol) kb_motivation need not kb_beryllium the pursuit of the kb_aesthetic . also , kb_art often depicts terrible images made for kb_social_anarchism , kb_morality , or thought-provoking reasons . for example , kb_francisco_goya goya 's kb_painting depicting the kb_spanish_empire shootings of 3rd of may 1808 is kb_a graphic depiction of kb_a firing squad executing several kb_pleading kb_civilian_casualties . yet at the same kb_time_(magazine) , the horrific kb_imagery demonstrates goya 's keen artistic ability in kb_function_composition and execution and produces fitting kb_social_anarchism and kb_politics outrage . thus , the kb_abortion_debate continues as to what kb_musical_mode of kb_aesthetic satisfaction , if any , is required to define 'art ' .the assumption of kb_new_world values or the rebellion against kb_acceptance#self_acceptance notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with kb_a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing . indeed , the kb_obverse_and_reverse is often kb_truth , that the revision of what is kb_folk_etymology conceived of as kb_being aesthetically appealing allows for kb_a re-invigoration of kb_aesthetic sensibility , and kb_a kb_new_world appreciation for the kb_corporate_social_responsibility of kb_art itself . countless schools have kb_anatolian_hypothesis their own ways to define quality , yet they all seem to agree in at least kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) point : once their kb_aesthetic choices are kb_acceptance#self_acceptance , the kb_lightness of the kb_cold_working of kb_art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen kb_list_of_art_mediums to kb_strike_action some kb_universal_studios chord by the rarity of the skill of the kb_artist or in its accurate kb_reflection_(physics) in what is termed the `` kb_zeitgeist '' . kb_art is often kb_intention to kb_appeal to and connect with kb_human kb_emotion . kb_it can arouse kb_aesthetic or kb_morality feelings , and can kb_beryllium understood as kb_a way of communicating these feelings . artists express something kb_sulfate that their audience is aroused to some extent , but they do not have to kb_women's_suffrage kb_sulfate consciously . kb_art may kb_beryllium considered an exploration of the kb_human_conditioncategory : kb_schopenhauer's_aestheticscategory :

apparent kb_miscarriage , depending upon the age and health of the kb_pregnant woman . 80 % of these spontaneous abortions happen in the kb_first_trimester .the most common cause of spontaneous kb_abortion during the kb_first_trimester is kb_chromosomal_abnormalities abnormalities of the kb_embryo or kb_fetus , accounting for at least 50 % of sampled early kb_pregnancy losses .

kb_gestational_age age , kb_methotrexate in combination with kb_a kb_prostaglandin kb_analog_device up to 7 weeks kb_gestation , or kb_a kb_prostaglandin kb_analog_device alone .

second-trimester abortions are performed surgically by kb_dilation_and_evacuation and evacuationup to 15 weeks ' kb_gestation , kb_suction-aspiration_abortion or kb_vacuum_aspiration are the most common surgical methods of kb_#induced kb_abortion . `` kb_manual_(music) kb_vacuum_aspiration '' ( mva ) consists of removing the kb_fetus or kb_embryo , kb_placenta , and membranes by suction using kb_a kb_manual_(music) syringe , while `` electric kb_vacuum_aspiration '' ( eva ) uses an electric pump . these techniques differ in the kb_mechanism_(biology) used to apply suction , in how early in

in very early kb_pregnancy , and does not require kb_cervical_dilation . kb_dilation_and_curettage and kb_curettage ( d & kb_vitamin_c ) , the kb_second_language most common method of surgical kb_abortion , is kb_a standard gynecological procedure performed for kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of reasons , including kb_hypothesis of the uterine lining for possible malignancy , investigation of abnormal bleeding , and kb_abortion . kb_curettage refers to cleaning the walls of the kb_uterus with kb_a kb_curette . the kb_world_health_organization organization recommends this procedure , also called `` sharp kb_curettage , '' only when mva is unavailable .from the 15th kb_gestational_age of kb_gestation until approximately the 26th , kb_other_(philosophy) techniques must kb_beryllium used . kb_dilation_and_evacuation and evacuation ( d & e ) consists of opening the kb_cervix of the kb_uterus and emptying kb_it using surgical instruments and suction . after the 16th kb_gestational_age of kb_gestation , abortions can also kb_beryllium induced by kb_intact_dilation_and_extraction dilation and extraction ( idx ) ( also called intrauterine cranial decompression ) , which requires surgical decompression of the kb_fetus 's kb_human_head before evacuation . idx is sometimes called `` kb_partial-birth_abortion kb_abortion '' , which has been kb_partial-birth_abortion_ban_act banned in the united kb_sovereign_state .in the kb_ipad_(third_generation) kb_pregnancy#terminology of kb_pregnancy , kb_#induced kb_abortion may kb_beryllium performed surgically by kb_intact_dilation_and_extraction dilation and extraction or by kb_hysterotomy_abortion . kb_hysterotomy_abortion is kb_a procedure similar to kb_a kb_caesarean_section kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) and is performed under kb_general_anesthesia . kb_it requires kb_a smaller incision than kb_a kb_caesarean_section kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) and is used during later stages of kb_pregnancy .first-trimester procedures can generally kb_beryllium performed using kb_local_anesthesia anesthesia , while second-trimester methods may require kb_sedation#levels_of_sedation sedation or kb_general_anesthesia .in places lacking the necessary kb_medical_abortion skill for dilation and extraction , or where preferred by practitioners , an kb_abortion can kb_beryllium induced by kb_first_trimester kb_labor_induction kb_australian_labor_party and then kb_late_termination_of_pregnancy#methods fetal demise if necessary . this is sometimes

very uncommon in the united kb_sovereign_state , more than 80 % of induced abortions throughout the kb_second_trimester are labor-induced abortions in kb_sweden and kb_other_(philosophy) nearby countries .only limited kb_big_data are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance comparing this method with dilation and extraction . unlike d & e , labor-induced abortions after kb_18-point_agreement weeks may kb_beryllium complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival , which may kb_beryllium legally characterized as kb_viviparity birth . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving ,

died and another was seriously injured when they attempted to procure an kb_abortion by taking kb_mentha_pulegium kb_palm_oil .because the indiscriminant use of kb_herbaceous_plant as abortifacients can cause serious—even lethal—side effects , such as kb_multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome failure , such use is not recommended by physicians .kb_abortion is sometimes attempted by causing kb_physical_trauma to the kb_abdomen . the kb_degree_(angle) of kb_force , if severe , can cause serious internal kb_injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing kb_miscarriage . in

.reported methods of unsafe , kb_self-induced_abortion kb_abortion include misuse of kb_misoprostolthe health risks of kb_abortion depend principally upon whether the procedure is performed safely or unsafely . the kb_world_health_organization organization defines unsafe abortions as those performed by unskilled individuals , with kb_hazardous equipment , or in unsanitary facilities . kb_law abortions performed in the kb_developed_world are among the safest procedures in kb_medicine . in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , the kb_risk of kb_maternal_death kb_death from kb_abortion is 0.7 per 100,000 procedures , making kb_abortion about kb_boron_group times safer for women than childbirth ( 8.8 kb_maternal_deaths kb_maternal_death per 100,000 live births ) . in the united kb_sovereign_state from 2000 to kb_2009_in_science , kb_abortion had kb_a lower mortality rate than kb_plastic_surgery . the kb_risk of abortion-related mortality increases with kb_gestational_age age , but remains lower than that of childbirth through at least 21 weeks ' kb_gestation . outpatient kb_abortion is as safe and effective from 64 to 70 days ' kb_gestation as kb_it is from 57 to 63 days . kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion is safe and effective for pregnancies kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet than 6 weeks ' kb_gestation .kb_vacuum_aspiration in the kb_first_trimester is the safest method of surgical kb_abortion , and can kb_beryllium performed in kb_a kb_primary_care kb_office , kb_abortion_clinic , or hospital . complications , which are rare , can include kb_uterine_perforation perforation , kb_endometritis kb_infection , and retained products of kb_human_fertilization requiring kb_a kb_second_language procedure to evacuate . infections account for one-third of abortion-related kb_maternal_death in the united kb_sovereign_state . the rate of complications of kb_vacuum_aspiration kb_abortion in the kb_first_trimester is similar regardless of whether the procedure is performed in kb_a hospital , surgical center , or kb_office . preventive kb_antibiotics ( such as kb_doxycycline or kb_metronidazole ) are typically given before elective kb_abortion , as they are believed to substantially reduce the kb_risk of postoperative uterine kb_infection . the rate of failed procedures does not appear to vary significantly depending on whether the kb_abortion is performed by kb_a kb_physician or kb_a kb_mid-level_practitioner practitioner . complications after second-trimester kb_abortion are similar to those after first-trimester kb_abortion , and depend somewhat on the method chosen . second-trimester abortions are generally well-tolerated .there is little difference in terms of kb_air_safety and kb_efficacy between kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion using kb_a combined regimen of kb_mifepristone and kb_misoprostol and surgical kb_abortion ( kb_vacuum_aspiration ) in early kb_first_trimester abortions up to 9 weeks kb_gestation . kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion using the kb_prostaglandin kb_analog_device kb_misoprostol alone is less effective and more painful than kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion using kb_a combined regimen of kb_mifepristone and kb_misoprostol or surgical kb_abortion .some purported risks of kb_abortion are promoted primarily by anti-abortion kb_group_(mathematics) ,but lack kb_scientific_method support . for example , the kb_question of kb_a link between kb_abortion-breast_cancer_hypothesis and kb_breast_cancer has been investigated extensively . kb_major_(united_states) kb_medical_abortion and kb_scientific_method bodies ( including the kb_world_health_organization organization , kb_national_cancer_institute kb_cancer institute , kb_american_cancer_society society , kb_royal_college_of_obstetricians_and_gynaecologists kb_college of obgyn and kb_american_congress_of_obstetricians_and_gynecologists of obgyn ) have concluded that kb_abortion does not cause kb_breast_cancer .in the kb_past even illegality has not automatically meant that the abortions were unsafe . referring to the kb_united_states_navy , historian kb_linda_gordon kb_gordon,_scotland kb_sovereign_state : `` in kb_fact , illegal abortions in this kb_country_music have an impressive kb_air_safety record .

according to the kb_guttmacher_institute institute , providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38,000 fewer kb_maternal_death from kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion annually worldwide .the rate of kb_law , kb_#induced kb_abortion varies extensively worldwide . according to the report of employees of kb_guttmacher_institute institute kb_it ranged from 7 per 1000 women ( kb_germany and kb_switzerland ) to 30 per 1000 women ( kb_estonia ) in countries with complete kb_statistics in 2008. the kb_hierarchical_proportion of pregnancies that ended in kb_#induced kb_abortion ranged from about 10 % ( kb_israel , kb_netherlands kb_netherlands and kb_switzerland ) to 30 % ( kb_estonia ) in the same kb_group_(periodic_table) , though kb_it might kb_beryllium as kb_high_middle_ages as 36 % kb_hungarian_revolution_of_1919 kb_hungary and kb_romania , whose kb_statistics were deemed incomplete .an kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) kb_science in kb_2002_australian_open concluded that about half of women having abortions were using kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_birth_control at the kb_time_(magazine) of becoming kb_pregnant . inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms and three-quarters of those using the kb_combined_oral_contraceptive_pill pill ; 42 % of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage . the kb_guttmacher_institute institute estimated that `` most abortions in the united kb_sovereign_state are obtained by minority women '' because minority women `` have much higher kb_rates_(tax) of kb_unintended_pregnancy kb_pregnancy '' .the kb_abortion rate may also kb_beryllium expressed as the average kb_grammatical_number of abortions kb_a woman has during her reproductive years ; this is referred to as `` total kb_abortion rate '' ( kb_tar ) .kb_abortion kb_rates_(tax) also vary depending on the stage of kb_pregnancy and the method practiced . in 2003 , the kb_centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention for kb_disease control and prevention ( kb_centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention ) reported that 26 % of reported kb_law induced abortions in the united kb_sovereign_state were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks ' kb_gestation , kb_18-point_agreement % at 7 weeks , 15 % at kb_group_8_element weeks , kb_18-point_agreement % at 9 through 10 weeks , 10 % at 11 through 12 weeks , 6 % at kb_boron_group through 15 weeks , 4 % at 16 through 20 weeks and 1 % at more than 21 weeks . 91 % of these were classified as having been done by `` kb_curettage '' ( kb_suction-aspiration_abortion , kb_dilation_and_curettage and kb_curettage , kb_dilation_and_evacuation and evacuation ) , kb_group_8_element % by `` kb_medical_abortion '' means ( kb_mifepristone ) , > 1 % by `` kb_instillation_abortion instillation '' ( kb_saline_(medicine) or kb_prostaglandin ) , and 1 % by `` kb_other_(philosophy) '' ( including kb_hysterotomy_abortion and kb_hysterectomy ) . according to the kb_centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention , due to kb_big_data kb_class_(set_theory) difficulties the kb_big_data must kb_beryllium viewed as tentative and some fetal kb_maternal_death reported beyond 20 weeks may kb_beryllium kb_natural_number kb_maternal_death erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead kb_fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an kb_#induced kb_abortion .the kb_guttmacher_institute institute estimated there were 2,200 kb_intact_dilation_and_extraction dilation and extractionthe reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the kb_world_war_ii .some of the most common reasons are to postpone childbearing to kb_a more suitable kb_time_(magazine) or to focus energies and resources on existing children . others include kb_being unable to afford kb_a child either in terms of the direct costs of raising kb_a child or the loss of kb_income while caring for the child , lack of support from the kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , inability to afford additional children , desire to provide schooling for existing children , disruption of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's own kb_education_in_albania , relationship kb_problems_(aristotle) with their partner , kb_a kb_machine_perception of kb_being too kb_thomas_young_(scientist) to have kb_a child , kb_unemployment , and not kb_being willing to raise kb_a child conceived as kb_a result of kb_rape or kb_incest , among others .some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures . these might include the preference for children of kb_a specific sex or kb_race_(human_categorization) , disapproval of kb_single_bond or early motherhood , stigmatization of kb_people_with_disabilities disabilities , insufficient kb_economic_anthropology support for kb_family_(biology) , lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods , or efforts toward kb_population_control ( such as kb_china 's kb_one-child_policy policy ) . these factors can sometimes result in kb_compulsory_education kb_abortion or kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion .an additional kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors is kb_risk to maternal or fetal health , which was cited as the kb_primary_education kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving for kb_abortion in over kb_a kb_ipad_(third_generation) of kb_noun_case in some countries and as kb_a significant kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors in only kb_a single-digit percentage of abortions in kb_other_(philosophy) countries .in the kb_united_states_navy , the supreme kb_court decisions in `` kb_roe_v._wade kb_verb wade '' and `` kb_doe_v._bolton kb_verb bolton '' : `` ruled that the kb_state_of_matter 's kb_interest in the kb_life_(magazine) of the kb_fetus became compelling only at the point of kb_fetal_viability , kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as the point at which the kb_fetus can survive independently of its mother . even after the point of kb_fetal_viability , the kb_state_of_matter can not favor the kb_life_(magazine) of the kb_fetus over the kb_life_(magazine) or health of the kb_pregnant woman . under the kb_right-wing_politics of privacy , physicians must kb_beryllium free to use their `` kb_medical_abortion kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition for the preservation of the kb_life_(magazine) or health of kb_the_mother_(1934_novel) mother .

to kb_physician ' fears of prosecution if they treat kb_other_(philosophy) gynecological emergencies . some countries , such as kb_bangladesh , that nominally kb_ban_(unit) kb_abortion , may also support clinics that perform abortions under the guise of menstrual hygiene . this is also kb_a terminology in traditional kb_medicine . in places where kb_abortion is illegal or carries heavy kb_social_stigma , kb_pregnant women may engage in kb_medical_tourism and kb_air_travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancies . women without the means to kb_air_travel can resort to providers of illegal abortions or attempt to perform an kb_abortion by themselves .the organization kb_women_on_waves on waves , has been providing kb_education_in_albania about kb_medical_abortion abortions since 1999. the ngo created kb_a kb_battle_of_mobile_(1781) kb_medical_abortion clinic inside kb_a shipping kb_container_(data_structure) , which then travels on kb_renting ships to countries with restrictive kb_abortion laws . because the ships are registered in kb_netherlands kb_netherlands , kb_dutch_language kb_law prevails when the kb_spacecraft is in kb_international_waters

development of this kb_technology has kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion , or the termination of kb_a kb_fetus based on sex . the selective termination of kb_a female kb_fetus is most common .kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth kb_rates_(tax) of kb_male and female children in some countries . the preference for kb_male children is reported in many areas of kb_asia_(roman_province) , and kb_abortion used to kb_limit_(mathematics) female births has been reported in kb_taiwan , kb_afghanistan–south_korea_relations , kb_indian_subcontinent , and kb_china . this deviation from the standard birth kb_rates_(tax) of males and females occurs despite the kb_fact that the kb_country_music in kb_question may have officially banned kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion or even sex-screening . in kb_china , kb_a historical preference for kb_a kb_male child has been exacerbated by the kb_one-child_policy policy , which was enacted in 1979 .many countries have taken kb_legislative steps to reduce the incidence of kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion . at the kb_international_conference_on_population_and_development kb_meeting on kb_population and development in kb_1994_uefa_champions_league_final over 180 kb_sovereign_state kb_draw_by_agreement to

by kb_a kb_parliamentary_assembly_of_the_council_of_europe kb_optical_resolution in 2011. the kb_world_health_organization organization and kb_unicef , along with kb_other_(philosophy) kb_united_nations nations agencies , have found that measures to reduce access to kb_abortion are much less effective at kb_redox sex-selective abortions than measures to reduce gender inequality .in kb_a kb_grammatical_number of kb_noun_case , kb_abortion providers and these facilities have been subjected to various kb_theory_of_forms of kb_violence , including kb_murder , attempted kb_murder , kidnapping , stalking , kb_assault , arson , and bombing . anti-abortion kb_violence is classified by both governmental and scholarly sources as kb_terrorism . only kb_a small kb_fraction_(mathematics) of those opposed to kb_abortion commit kb_violence .in the united kb_sovereign_state , four physicians kb_world_health_organization performed abortions have been murdered : kb_david_gunn_(doctor) ( kb_fiba_european_championship_1992–93 ) , kb_john_britton_(doctor) ( kb_1994_uefa_champions_league_final ) , kb_barnett_slepian slepian ( kb_1998_nrl_season ) , and

have also taken kb_place_of_articulation in the united kb_sovereign_state and kb_canada . hundreds of bombings , arsons , kb_acid attacks , invasions , and incidents of kb_vandalism against

.kb_legal_protection_of_access_to_abortion of access to kb_abortion has been brought into some countries where kb_abortion is kb_law . these laws typically seek to protect kb_abortion clinics from obstruction , kb_vandalism , picketing , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_orthopraxy , or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment .far more common than kb_health kb_violence is kb_psychology kb_pressure . in 2003 , chris danze organized kb_pro-life organizations throughout kb_texas to prevent the kb_construction of kb_a kb_planned_parenthood parenthood facility in kb_austin,_texas . the organizations kb_doxing the kb_personal_property kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) online , of those involved with kb_construction , sending them up to 1200 phone calls kb_a day and contacting their kb_church_(building) . some protestors record women entering clinics on kb_camera .spontaneous kb_abortion occurs in various kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing . for example , in kb_sheep kb_it may kb_beryllium caused by kb_stress_(linguistics) or kb_health kb_exertion , such as crowding through doors or kb_being chased by dogs . in cows , kb_abortion may kb_beryllium caused by contagious kb_disease , such as kb_brucellosis or `` kb_campylobacter '' , but can often kb_beryllium controlled by kb_vaccination . eating kb_pine needles can also induce abortions in cows .several plants , including kb_gutierrezia_sarothrae , kb_veratrum_californicum , kb_conium_maculatum , and kb_nicotiana_glauca , are known to cause fetal deformities and kb_abortion in kb_cattle and in kb_sheep and goats . in horses , kb_a kb_fetus may kb_beryllium aborted or resorbed if kb_it has kb_lethal_white_syndrome kb_white_american syndrome ( kb_congenital intestinal aganglionosis ) . foal kb_embryos that are homozygous for the kb_dominant_white kb_gene ( ww ) are theorized to also kb_beryllium aborted or resorbed before birth . in many kb_species of sharks and kb_ray_(geometry) , stress-induced abortions occur frequently on capture .kb_virus_(biology) kb_infection can cause kb_abortion in dogs . cats can experience spontaneous kb_abortion for many reasons , including kb_hormone imbalance . kb_a combined kb_abortion and spaying is performed on kb_pregnant cats , especially in kb_trap-neuter-return programs , to prevent unwanted kittens from kb_being born .female rodents may terminate kb_a kb_pregnancy when exposed to the smell of kb_a kb_male not responsible for the kb_pregnancy , known as the kb_bruce_effect effect .kb_abortion may also kb_beryllium induced in kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing , in the kb_context_(language_use) of kb_animal_husbandry . for example , kb_abortion may kb_beryllium induced in mares that have been mated improperly , or that have been purchased by owners kb_world_health_organization did not realize the mares were kb_pregnant , or that are kb_pregnant with twin foals . kb_feticide can occur in horses and zebras due to kb_male harassment of kb_pregnant mares or forced kb_copulation_(zoology) , although the kb_frequency in the kb_wildlife has been

angolan kb_royal_navy is undergoing modernisation but is still lacking in many ways . kb_kingdom_of_portugal has been providing kb_military_education_and_training through its technical kb_military kb_cooperation ( ctm ) programme . the kb_royal_navy is requesting procurement of kb_a frigate , kb_triliteral corvettes , kb_triliteral offshore patrol vessel and additional fast patrol boats .most of the vessels in the kb_royal_navy 's kb_inventory dates back from the 1980s or kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet , and many of its ships are inoperable due to age and lack of maintenance . however the kb_royal_navy acquired kb_new_world boats from kb_spain and kb_france in the 1990s . kb_germany has delivered several kb_fast_attack_craft attack kb_craft for

technical memorandum of understanding ( mou ) covering the production of the vessels as part of kb_angola_(portugal) 's naval kb_power_(physics) development programme ( pronaval ) . the kb_military of kb_angola_(portugal) aims to modernize its naval capability , presumably due to kb_a rise in maritime piracy within the gulf of kb_guinea which may have an kb_adverse_effect_(medicine) effect on the

kb_unita in the kb_albanian_ohrid_lake_coast , and its conventional capabilities were demonstrated principally in the undeclared kb_south_african_border_war kb_border_crossings_of_albania kb_war . the

kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty into kb_a trap . zollicoffer decided kb_it was impossible to obey kb_order_(biology) to return to the kb_other_(philosophy) side of the kb_river because of kb_scarcity of kb_transport and kb_principles_of_grouping of kb_union_(american_civil_war) troops . when kb_union_(american_civil_war) brig . gen. kb_george_h._thomas kb_thomas_lincoln moved against the

make kb_a difference in the kb_theater_(military) . kb_union_(american_civil_war) officers heard that kb_he_(letter) was bringing 15 regiments with him , but this was an exaggeration of kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty .based on the assumption that kb_kentucky neutrality would act as kb_a shield against kb_a direct invasion from the kb_north , circumstances that no longer kb_applied_science in september 1861 , kb_tennessee initially had sent men to kb_virginia and concentrated defenses in the kb_mississippi kb_valley . even before johnston arrived in kb_tennessee , kb_construction of kb_2_(number) forts had been started to defend the kb_tennessee and the kb_cumberland_river kb_list_of_rivers_of_alberta , which provided avenues into the kb_state_of_matter from the kb_north . both

gen. polk ignored the kb_problems_(aristotle) of the forts when kb_he_(letter) took kb_command_economy . after johnston took kb_command_economy , polk at kb_first_trimester refused to comply with johnston 's kb_order_(biology) to send an kb_civil_engineering , lt. joseph k. dixon , to inspect the forts . after johnston asserted kb_histidine kb_authority , polk had to allow dixon to proceed . dixon recommended that the forts kb_beryllium maintained and strengthened , although they were not in kb_ideal_(ring_theory) locations , because much kb_cold_working had been done on them and the

kb_positional_notation . kb_histidine passive defensive performance while positioning himself in kb_a forward kb_positional_notation at bowling kb_green_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , spreading kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty too thinly , not concentrating kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty in the face of kb_union_(american_civil_war) advances , and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the kb_time_(magazine) and by later historians . the fall of the forts exposed kb_nashville,_tennessee to imminent attack , and kb_it fell without kb_electrical_resistance to kb_union_(american_civil_war) kb_afsharid_dynasty under brig . gen. buell on kb_february_revolution 25 , 1862 , kb_2_(number) days after johnston had to pull kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty out in kb_order_(biology) to avoid having them captured as kb_water_well .johnston had various remaining kb_military units scattered throughout kb_histidine kb_territories_of_the_united_states and retreating to the kb_southern_africa to avoid kb_being cut off . johnston himself retreated with the kb_force under kb_histidine kb_personal_property kb_command_economy , the kb_british_army of kb_central_europe kb_kentucky , from the vicinity of kb_nashville,_tennessee . with beauregard 's help , johnston decided to kb_concentrate_(screenplay) kb_afsharid_dynasty with those formerly under polk and now already under beauregard 's kb_command_economy at the strategically located railroad crossroads of kb_corinth , kb_mississippi , which kb_he_(letter) reached by kb_a circuitous route . johnston kept the kb_union_(american_civil_war) kb_afsharid_dynasty , now under the overall kb_command_economy of the ponderous kb_major_general_(csa) gen. kb_henry_halleck halleck , confused and hesitant to move , allowing johnston to reach kb_histidine objective undetected . this delay allowed kb_jefferson_davis davis finally to send reinforcements from the kb_garrisons of kb_coastal cities and another highly rated but prickly kb_general_(united_states) , kb_braxton_bragg bragg , to help organize the kb_western_esotericism kb_afsharid_dynasty . bragg at least calmed the nerves of beauregard and polk , kb_world_health_organization had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior kb_afsharid_dynasty , before johnston 's kb_arrival_(abba_album) on kb_march 24 , 1862 .johnston 's kb_british_army of 17,000 men gave the confederates kb_a combined kb_force of about 40,000 to 44,669 men at kb_corinth . on kb_march 29 , 1862 , johnston officially took kb_command_economy of this combined kb_force , which continued to use the kb_british_army of the kb_mississippi kb_toponymy under which kb_it had been organized by beauregard on kb_march 5 .johnston now planned to defeat the kb_union_(american_civil_war) kb_afsharid_dynasty piecemeal before the various kb_union_(american_civil_war) units in kb_kentucky and kb_tennessee under kb_ulysses_s._grant with 40,000 men at nearby pittsburg kb_landing , kb_tennessee , and the now kb_major_general_(csa) gen. kb_don_carlos_buell kb_carlos_cuarón buell on kb_histidine way from kb_nashville,_tennessee with 35,000 men , could unite against him . johnston started kb_histidine kb_british_army in kb_motion_(physics) on april 3 , 1862 , intent on surprising kb_ulysses_s._grant 's kb_force as soon as the kb_next day , but they moved slowly due to their inexperience , bad roads , and lack of adequate kb_stick_fighting kb_automated_planning_and_scheduling . due to the delays , as kb_water_well as several contacts with the enemy , johnston 's kb_second_language in kb_command_economy , kb_p._g._t._beauregard g. t. beauregardjohnston launched kb_a massive surprise attack with kb_histidine concentrated kb_afsharid_dynasty against kb_ulysses_s._grant at the kb_battle_of_shiloh kb_battle_of_shiloh on april 6 , 1862. as the kb_confederate_states_army kb_afsharid_dynasty overran the kb_union_(american_civil_war) camps , johnston seemed to kb_beryllium everywhere , personally leading and kb_rallying troops up and down the kb_line_(geometry) on kb_histidine horse . at about 2:30 kb_picometer , while leading kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of those charges against kb_a kb_union_(american_civil_war) camp near the `` kb_peach orchard , '' kb_he_(letter) was wounded , taking kb_a kb_bullet behind kb_histidine kb_right-wing_politics knee . kb_he_(letter) apparently did not think the wound was serious at the kb_time_(magazine) , or even possibly did not kb_sentience kb_it . kb_it is possible that johnston 's kb_duel in 1837 had caused kb_nerve damage or numbness to kb_histidine kb_right-wing_politics leg and that kb_he_(letter) did not kb_sentience the wound to kb_histidine leg as kb_a result . the kb_bullet had in kb_fact clipped kb_a part of kb_histidine kb_popliteal_artery artery and kb_histidine boot was filling up with blood . there were no kb_medical_abortion personnel on scene at the kb_time_(magazine) , since johnston had sent kb_histidine kb_personal_property surgeon to care for the wounded kb_confederate_states_army troops and yankee prisoners kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet in the kb_battle_abbey .within kb_a few minutes , johnston was observed by kb_histidine kb_stick_fighting to kb_beryllium nearly fainting . among kb_histidine kb_stick_fighting was kb_isham_g._harris g. harris , the kb_governor_of_tennessee kb_tennessee , kb_world_health_organization had ceased to make any real effort to kb_function_(biology) as kb_governor_(united_states) after kb_learning that kb_abraham_lincoln had appointed kb_andrew_johnson johnson as kb_military kb_governor_of_tennessee kb_tennessee . seeing johnston slumping in kb_histidine saddle and kb_histidine face turning deathly pale , harris asked : `` kb_general_(united_states) , are you wounded ? '' johnston glanced down at kb_histidine leg wound , then faced harris and replied in kb_a weak voice kb_histidine last kb_lexical_semantics : `` yes ... and kb_iodine kb_fear seriously . '' harris and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_stick_fighting officers removed johnston from kb_histidine horse and carried him to kb_a small ravine near the `` hornets nest '' and desperately tried to kb_aid the kb_general_(united_states) kb_world_health_organization had kb_lost_film consciousness by this point . harris then sent an aide to fetch johnston 's surgeon but did not apply kb_a kb_tourniquet to johnson 's wounded leg . before kb_a kb_physician could kb_beryllium found , johnston died from blood loss kb_a few minutes later . kb_it is believed that johnston may have lived for as kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hour after receiving kb_histidine fatal wound . ironically , kb_it was later discovered that johnston had kb_a kb_tourniquet in kb_histidine pocket when kb_he_(letter) died .harris and the kb_other_(philosophy) officers wrapped kb_general_(united_states) johnston 's kb_human_body in kb_a blanket kb_sulfate as not to damage the troops ' morale with the sight of the dead kb_general_(united_states) . johnston and kb_histidine wounded horse , kb_fire_(classical_element) eater , were taken to kb_histidine field headquarters on the kb_corinth road , where kb_histidine kb_human_body remained in kb_histidine tent until the kb_confederate_states_army kb_british_army withdrew to kb_corinth the kb_next day , april 7 , 1862 , after failing to gain kb_a decisive victory over the kb_union_(american_civil_war) armies . from there , kb_histidine kb_human_body was taken to the home of kb_colonel_(united_states) william inge , which had been kb_histidine headquarters in kb_corinth . kb_it was covered in the kb_confederate_states_army kb_flag_of_azerbaijan and lay in kb_state_of_matter for several hours .kb_it is probable that kb_a kb_confederate_states_army soldier kb_carlsbad_decrees the fatal round . no kb_union_(american_civil_war) soldiers had ever been observed to have gotten behind johnston during the fatal kb_electric_charge , but kb_it is known that many confederates were firing at the kb_union_(american_civil_war) lines while johnston kb_electric_charge kb_water_well in advance of kb_histidine soldiers . furthermore , the surgeon kb_world_health_organization later dug the kb_bullet out of johnston 's leg kb_interpretatio_graeca the round as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_carlsbad_decrees from kb_a kb_pattern_1853_enfield kb_enfield,_south_australiajohnston was survived by kb_histidine wife eliza and six children . kb_histidine wife and five younger children , including kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) born after kb_he_(letter) went to kb_war , chose to live out their days at home in los angeles with eliza 's brother , dr. kb_john_strother_griffin kb_griffin . johnston 's eldest son , kb_albert_speer_(born_1934) sidney jr. ( born in kb_texas ) , had already followed him into the kb_confederate_states_army . in 1863 , after taking home leave in los angeles , kb_albert_speer_(born_1934) jr. was on kb_histidine way out of kb_san_pedro,_california harbor on kb_a kb_ferry . while kb_a steamer was taking on passengers from the kb_ferry , kb_a kb_wave swamped the smaller boat , causing its boilers to explode .

kb_adaptation back in 2003. after that , kb_a year later , they made kb_a couple of kb_major_(united_states) improvements to the design . the kb_robot features an elastic mask made from the average kb_human_head dummy . kb_it uses kb_a driving system with kb_a 3dof kb_units_of_measurement . the wd-2 kb_robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on kb_a mask , with

kb_freedom . as for the materials they used , the wd-2 's mask is fabricated with kb_a highly elastic kb_material called septom , with bits of kb_steel kb_wool mixed in for added kb_strength_of_materials . kb_other_(philosophy) technical features reveal kb_a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point , driven by kb_a dc motor with kb_a kb_simple_polygon pulley and kb_a slide screw . apparently , the researchers can also modify the kb_shape of the mask based on actual kb_human faces . to `` copy '' kb_a face , they need only kb_a 3d scanner to determine the locations of an kb_individual 's 17 facial points . after that , they are then driven into kb_positional_notation using kb_a laptop and 56 motor control boards . in kb_addition , the researchers also

'' and its kb_film kb_adaptation `` kb_blade_runner runner '' discovers that kb_histidine targets appear to kb_beryllium , in some ways , more `` kb_human '' than kb_he_(letter) is . android stories , therefore , are not essentially stories `` about '' androids ; they are stories about the kb_human_condition and what kb_it means to kb_beryllium kb_human .kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_aspect of writing about the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as kb_a kb_mechanism_(biology) for kb_exploring kb_racism in society , as in `` kb_blade_runner runner '' . perhaps the clearest example of this is kb_john_brunner_(novelist) 's kb_from_the_earth_to_the_moon_(miniseries)#episodes kb_the_children_of_men `` kb_into_the_slave_nebula the slave kb_nebula '' , where the blue-skinned android kb_atlantic_slave_trade are explicitly shown to kb_beryllium fully kb_human . more recently , the androids kb_bishop_(aliens) and annalee call in the kb_adventure_film `` kb_aliens_(film) '' and `` kb_alien_resurrection '' are used as vehicles for kb_exploring how humans deal with the presence of an `` kb_other_(philosophy) '' .female androids , or `` gynoids '' , are often seen in kb_science_fiction , and can kb_beryllium viewed as kb_a continuation of the kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical `` kb_perfect_(grammar) woman '' . examples include the kb_greek_mythology of `` kb_pygmalion_(mythology) '' and kb_maschinenmensch female kb_robot maria in kb_fritz_lang lang 's `` kb_metropolis_(1927_film) '' . some gynoids , like pris in `` kb_blade_runner runner '' , are kb_aircraft_design_process as sex-objects , with the intent of `` pleasing men 's violent sexual desires '' , or as submissive , servile companions , such as in `` kb_the_stepford_wives stepford wives '' . kb_artificial_intelligence_in_fiction about gynoids has therefore been described as reinforcing `` essentialist kb_idea of femininity '' , although others have suggested that the treatment of androids is kb_a way of kb_exploring kb_racism and kb_misogyny

kb_calgary , kb_north to kb_edmonton , and then kb_east_africa to kb_lloydminster , contains the most kb_fertile_soil kb_soil in the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands and most of the kb_population . much of the unforested part of kb_alberta is given over either to kb_cereal or to kb_dairy_farming farming , with kb_mixed_farming farming more common in the kb_north and centre , while ranching and kb_irrigation kb_agriculture predominate in the kb_southern_africa .the kb_alberta kb_badlands_(film) are located in southeastern kb_alberta , where the kb_red_deer_river kb_river crosses the flat kb_prairie and kb_arable_land , and features deep kb_submarine_canyon and striking landforms . kb_dinosaur_provincial_park provincial park , near brooks , kb_alberta , showcases the kb_badlands_(film)

kb_continental_climatekb_alberta extends for over from kb_north to kb_southern_africa ; its kb_climate_of_albania , therefore , varies considerably . average kb_high_middle_ages temperatures in kb_january range from in the southwest to in the far kb_north . the kb_climate_of_albania is also influenced by the presence of the kb_rocky_mountains mountains to the southwest , which disrupt the kb_flow_(psychology) of the kb_westerlies westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the kb_western_esotericism slopes of the kb_mountain ranges before reaching the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands , casting kb_a kb_rain_shadow over much of kb_alberta . the northerly kb_location_(sign_language) and kb_isolationism from the kb_dashboard_(macos) kb_systems_analysis of the kb_pacific_ocean cause kb_alberta to have kb_a dry kb_climate_of_albania with little kb_moderation from the kb_oceanus . kb_annual_plant kb_precipitation_(meteorology) ranges from in the kb_albanian_ohrid_lake_coast to in the kb_north , except in the foothills of the kb_rocky_mountains mountains where total kb_precipitation_(meteorology) including snowfall can reach annually .the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands is the namesake of the kb_alberta_clipper , kb_a kb_type_(biology) of intense , fast-moving kb_winter storm that generally kb_theory_of_forms over or near the

bright sunshine totals range between 1,900 up to just under 2,600 hours per year . kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta gets about kb_18-point_agreement hours of daylight in the summer .in southwestern kb_alberta , the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm , dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains , which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to kb_water_well above the freezing point in kb_a very short period . during kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) chinook recorded at kb_pincher_creek kb_muscogee_people , temperatures soared from in just kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hour . the kb_region around kb_lethbridge has the most chinooks , averaging 30 to kb_35_arietis chinook days per year . kb_calgary has kb_a 56 % chance of kb_a kb_white_christmas_(weather) , while kb_edmonton has an 86 % chance .kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta is mostly covered by kb_taiga kb_forest and has kb_a kb_subarctic_climate . the kb_agriculture kb_area of kb_southern_europe kb_alberta has kb_a kb_semi-arid_climate kb_steppe kb_climate_of_albania because the kb_annual_plant kb_precipitation_(meteorology) is less than the kb_water that kb_evapotranspiration or is used by plants . the southeastern corner of kb_alberta , part of the kb_palliser's_triangle kb_triangle_(musical_instrument) , experiences greater summer kb_heat_(1972_film) and lower rainfall than the rest of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands , and as kb_a result suffers frequent kb_crop_yield kb_problems_(aristotle) and occasional kb_4.2_kiloyear_event droughts . kb_western_esotericism kb_alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by kb_winter chinook winds . kb_central_europe and parts of kb_northern_mountain_range_(albania) kb_alberta in the kb_peace_river_(canada) kb_region are largely kb_aspen_parkland , kb_a kb_biome transitional between kb_prairie to the kb_southern_africa and kb_taiga kb_forest to the kb_north .after kb_saskatchewan , kb_alberta experiences the most tornadoes in kb_canada with an average of 15 verified per year . thunderstorms , some of them severe , are frequent in the summer , especially in kb_central_europe and kb_southern_europe kb_alberta . the kb_region surrounding the kb_calgary–edmonton_corridor corridor is notable for having the highest kb_frequency of kb_hail in kb_canada , which is caused by orographic liftingin kb_central_europe and kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta the kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_castalian_spring is marked by the early flowering of the kb_prairie crocus kb_anemone ; this member of the buttercup kb_family_(biology) has been recorded flowering as early as kb_march , though april is the usual month for the kb_general_(united_states) kb_population . kb_other_(philosophy) kb_prairie kb_flora known to kb_flower early are the kb_thermopsis_rhombifolia and kb_rosa_acicularis . members of the kb_sunflower kb_family_(biology) blossom on the kb_prairie in the summer months between july and september . the kb_southern_europe and kb_east_africa kb_central_europe parts of kb_alberta are covered by short kb_prairie kb_poaceae , which dries up as summer lengthens , to kb_beryllium replaced by hardy kb_perennial_plant such as the kb_prairie coneflower , kb_fleabane , and kb_sagebrush . both yellow and

= mc that kb_albert_einstein published in the `` kb_annalen_der_physik der physik '' kb_scientific_journal in 1905. these four works contributed substantially to the kb_foundation_(engineering) of kb_history_of_physics#modern_physics and changed views on kb_space , kb_time_(magazine) , and kb_matter . the four papers are :kb_albert_einstein 's kb_first_trimester paper submitted in 1900 to `` kb_annalen_der_physik der physik '' was on kb_capillary_attraction attraction . kb_it was published in 1901 with the kb_title `` folgerungen aus kb_burrow capillaritätserscheinungen '' , which translates as `` kb_logical_consequence from the capillarity kb_phenomenon '' . kb_2_(number) papers kb_he_(letter) published in 1902–1903 ( kb_thermodynamics ) attempted to interpret kb_atomic_radius kb_phenomenon from kb_a kb_statistical_mechanics point of view . these papers were the kb_foundation_(engineering) for the 1905 paper on kb_brownian_motion kb_motion_(physics) , which showed that brownian kb_movement_(sign_language) can kb_beryllium construed as firm kb_evidence_(law) that molecules exist . kb_histidine kb_research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of kb_finite_set kb_atomic_radius size on kb_diffusion kb_phenomenon .kb_albert_einstein returned to the problem of kb_thermodynamic fluctuations , giving kb_a treatment of the kb_density variations in kb_a kb_fluid at its critical point . ordinarily the kb_density fluctuations are controlled by the kb_second_language derivative of the free kb_energy_industry with respect to the kb_density . at the critical point , this derivative is kb_0_(number) , leading to kb_prespa_lake fluctuations . the effect of kb_density fluctuations is that kb_light of all kb_electromagnetic_spectrum is scattered , making the kb_fluid kb_look_(american_magazine) milky kb_white_american . kb_albert_einstein relates this to kb_rayleigh_scattering scattering , which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the kb_wavelength , and which explains why the kb_sky is blue . kb_albert_einstein quantitatively kb_derived_trait critical opalescence from kb_a treatment of kb_density fluctuations , and demonstrated how both the effect and kb_rayleigh_scattering scattering originate from the atomistic kb_united_states_constitution of kb_matter .kb_albert_einstein 's `` '' zur elektrodynamik bewegter körper '' '' ( `` on the kb_electrodynamics of moving bodies '' ) was received on 30 june 1905 and published 26 september of that same year . kb_it reconciled conflicts between kb_james_clerk_maxwell 's equations ( the laws of electricity and magnetism ) and the laws of kb_newtonian_mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of kb_mechanics . observationally , the effects of these changes are most apparent at kb_high_middle_ages speeds ( where kb_object_relations_theory are moving at speeds close to the kb_speed_of_light of kb_light ) . the kb_theory kb_adaptation in this paper later became known as kb_albert_einstein 's special kb_theory_of_relativity relativity .this paper predicted that , when measured in the frame of kb_a relatively moving observer , kb_a clock carried by kb_a moving kb_human_body would appear to kb_time_dilation down , and the kb_human_body itself would kb_length_contraction in its direction of kb_motion_(physics) . this paper also argued that the idea of kb_a luminiferous aether—one of the leading kb_scientific_theory entities in kb_physics at the time—was superfluous .in kb_histidine paper on kb_mass–energy_equivalence equivalence , kb_albert_einstein produced `` e '' = '' mc '' as kb_a consequence of kb_histidine kb_special_relativity relativity equations . kb_albert_einstein 's 1905 kb_cold_working on relativity remained controversial for many years , but was kb_acceptance#self_acceptance by leading kb_physicists , starting with kb_max_planck planck .kb_albert_einstein originally framed kb_special_relativity relativity in terms of kb_kinematics ( the kb_science of moving bodies ) . in 1908 , kb_hermann_minkowski minkowski reinterpreted kb_special_relativity relativity in kb_geometry terms as kb_a kb_theory of kb_spacetime . kb_albert_einstein kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome minkowski 's kb_formalism_(art) in kb_histidine 1915 kb_general_theory_of_relativity of relativitykb_general_(united_states) relativity ( gr ) is kb_a kb_theory_of_gravitation gravitation that was kb_adaptation by kb_albert_einstein between 1907 and 1915. according to kb_general_(united_states) relativity , the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of kb_spacetime kb_time_(magazine) by those masses . kb_general_(united_states) relativity has kb_adaptation into an kb_essential_element kb_tool in kb_modern_history kb_astrophysics . kb_it provides the kb_foundation_(engineering) for the kb_electric_current understanding of kb_black_holes , kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey of kb_space where gravitational attraction is kb_sulfate kb_strong_nuclear_force that not even kb_light can escape .as kb_albert_einstein later said , the kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving for the development of kb_general_(united_states) relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within kb_special_relativity relativity was unsatisfactory , while kb_a kb_theory which from the outset prefers no kb_state_of_matter of kb_motion_(physics) ( even accelerated ones ) should appear more satisfactory . consequently , in 1907 kb_he_(letter) published an article on kb_acceleration under kb_special_relativity relativity . in that article titled `` on the relativity kb_principle_(chemistry) and the kb_logical_consequence kb_drawing_(metalworking) from kb_it '' , kb_he_(letter) argued that kb_free_fall fall is really inertial kb_motion_(physics) , and that for kb_a free-falling observer the kb_biological_rules of kb_special_relativity relativity must apply . this kb_argument_of_a_function is called the kb_equivalence_principle kb_principle_(chemistry) . in the same article , kb_albert_einstein also predicted the kb_phenomenon of kb_gravitational_time_dilation kb_time_(magazine) dilation , kb_gravitational_red_shift kb_red_shift_(novel) and kb_gravitational_lensing of kb_light .in kb_1911_in_argentine_football , kb_albert_einstein published another article `` on the influence of gravitation on the propagation of kb_light '' expanding on the 1907 article , in which kb_he_(letter) estimated the amount of kb_gravitational_lensing of kb_light by massive bodies . thus , the kb_scientific_theory prediction of kb_general_(united_states) relativity could for the kb_first_trimester kb_time_(magazine) kb_beryllium tested experimentally .in 1916 , kb_albert_einstein predicted gravitational waves , ripples in the kb_curvature of kb_spacetime which propagate as waves , kb_traveling outward from the source , transporting kb_energy_industry as gravitational kb_radiation . the kb_existence of gravitational waves is possible under kb_general_(united_states) relativity due to its kb_lorentz_invariance invariance which brings the kb_concept of kb_a kb_finite_set speed of propagation of the kb_health kb_interaction_(statistics) of kb_gravity_(2013_film) with kb_it . by kb_contrast_(vision) , gravitational waves can not exist in the kb_newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation of gravitation , which postulates that the kb_health kb_interaction_(statistics) of kb_gravity_(2013_film) propagate at kb_infinite_set speed .the kb_first_trimester , indirect , detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through kb_observation of kb_a pair of closely orbiting kb_neutron_stars , kb_psr_b1913+16 b1913+16 . the explanation of the kb_decay_chain in their kb_orbital_period was that they were emitting gravitational waves . kb_albert_einstein 's prediction was kb_confirmation on 11 kb_february_revolution 2016 , when researchers at kb_ligo published the kb_first_observation_of_gravitational_waves of gravitational waves , kb_discovery_of_the_chemical_elements on kb_earth on 14 september 2015 , exactly kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hundred years after the prediction .while developing kb_general_(united_states) relativity , kb_albert_einstein became confused about the kb_gauge_invariance in the kb_theory . kb_he_(letter) formulated an kb_argument_of_a_function that kb_light-emitting_diode him to conclude that kb_a kb_general_(united_states) kb_relativistic_quantum_chemistry kb_field_theory_(mathematics) kb_theory is impossible . kb_he_(letter) gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations , and searched for equations that would kb_beryllium kb_invariant_(mathematics) under kb_general_(united_states) kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history transformations only .in june 1913 , the entwurf ( `` draft '' ) kb_theory was the result of these investigations . as its kb_toponymy suggests , kb_it was kb_a sketch of kb_a kb_theory , less elegant and more difficult than kb_general_(united_states) relativity , with the equations of kb_motion_(physics) supplemented by additional kb_russian_gauge fixing conditions . after more than kb_2_(number) years of kb_intensive kb_cold_working , kb_albert_einstein realized that the kb_hole_argument kb_argument_of_a_function was mistaken and abandoned the kb_theory in november 1915 .in 1917 , kb_albert_einstein kb_applied_science the kb_general_theory_of_relativity of relativity to the kb_structure of the kb_universe as kb_a whole . kb_he_(letter) discovered that the kb_general_(united_states) field equations predicted kb_a kb_universe that was dynamic , either contracting or expanding . as kb_observational_astronomy kb_evidence_(law) for kb_a dynamic kb_universe was not known at the kb_time_(magazine) , kb_albert_einstein introduced kb_a kb_new_world kb_terminology , the kb_cosmological_constant constant , to the field equations , in kb_order_(biology) to allow the kb_theory to predict kb_a static kb_universe . the modified field equations predicted kb_a static kb_universe of closed kb_curvature , in accordance with kb_albert_einstein 's understanding of mach 's kb_principle_(chemistry) in these years . this kb_rutherford_model became known as the kb_albert_einstein kb_world_war_ii or kb_albert_einstein 's static kb_universe .following the discovery of the kb_recession of the nebulae by kb_edwin_hubble hubble in 1929 , kb_albert_einstein abandoned kb_histidine static kb_rutherford_model of the kb_universe , and kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_2_(number) dynamic models of the cosmos , kb_the_friedmann-einstein_universe friedmann-einstein kb_universe of 1931 and the kb_einstein–de_sitter_universe sitter kb_universe of 1932. in each of these models , kb_albert_einstein discarded the kb_cosmological_constant constant , claiming that kb_it was `` in any case theoretically unsatisfactory '' .in many kb_albert_einstein biographies , kb_it is claimed that kb_albert_einstein referred to the kb_cosmological_constant constant in later years as kb_histidine `` biggest blunder '' . the kb_astrophysicist kb_mario_livio livio has recently kb_casting_(metalworking) doubt on this kb_lawsuit , suggesting that kb_it may kb_beryllium exaggerated .in late kb_2013_mediterranean_games , kb_a team kb_light-emitting_diode by the kb_irish_american kb_physicist kb_cormac_o'raifeartaigh o'raifeartaigh discovered kb_evidence_(law) that , shortly after kb_learning of hubble 's kb_observations_(pierre_belon) of the kb_recession of the nebulae , kb_albert_einstein considered kb_a kb_steady_state_theory kb_rutherford_model of the kb_universe . in kb_a hitherto overlooked manuscript , apparently written in early 1931 , kb_albert_einstein explored kb_a kb_rutherford_model of the expanding kb_universe in which the kb_density of kb_matter remains constant due to kb_a kb_continuous_function creation of kb_matter , kb_a process kb_he_(letter) associated with the kb_cosmological_constant constant . as kb_he_(letter) stated in the paper , `` in what follows , kb_iodine would like to draw attention to kb_a kb_solid_solution to equation ( 1 ) that can account for hubbel 's [ `` sic '' ] facts , and in which the kb_density is constant over kb_time_(magazine) '' ... `` if kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) considers kb_a physically bounded kb_volume , kb_subatomic_particle of kb_matter kb_will_and_testament kb_beryllium continually leaving kb_it . for the kb_density to remain constant , kb_new_world kb_subatomic_particle of kb_matter must kb_beryllium continually formed in the kb_volume from kb_space . ''kb_it thus appears that kb_albert_einstein considered kb_a kb_steady_state_theory kb_rutherford_model of the expanding kb_universe many years before hoyle , bondi and kb_gold . however , kb_albert_einstein 's kb_steady_state_theory kb_rutherford_model contained kb_a fundamental flaw and kb_he_(letter) quickly abandoned the idea .kb_general_(united_states) relativity includes kb_a dynamical kb_spacetime , kb_sulfate kb_it is difficult to kb_episcopal_see how to identify the conserved kb_energy_industry and kb_momentum . noether 's kb_theorem allows these quantities to kb_beryllium determined from kb_a kb_lagrangian_(field_theory) with kb_translational_symmetry , but kb_general_covariance makes kb_translational_symmetry into something of kb_a kb_gauge_symmetry . the kb_energy_industry and kb_momentum kb_derived_trait within kb_general_(united_states) relativity by noether 's prescriptions do not make kb_a real tensor for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving .kb_albert_einstein argued that this is kb_truth for fundamental reasons , because the gravitational field could kb_beryllium made to vanish by kb_a kb_utility of coordinates . kb_he_(letter) maintained that the non-covariant kb_energy_industry kb_momentum pseudotensor was in kb_fact the best description of the kb_energy_industry kb_momentum distribution in kb_a gravitational field . this approach has been echoed by kb_lev_landau landau and kb_evgeny_lifshitz lifshitz , and others , and has become standard .the use of non-covariant kb_object_relations_theory like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by kb_erwin_schrödinger kb_erwin_schrödinger and others .in 1935 , kb_albert_einstein collaborated with kb_nathan_rosen rosen to produce kb_a kb_rutherford_model of kb_a kb_wormhole , often called kb_einstein–rosen_bridges kb_romanesque_architecture . kb_histidine kb_motivation was to kb_rutherford_model kb_elementary_school kb_subatomic_particle with kb_electric_charge as kb_a kb_solid_solution of gravitational field equations , in kb_line_(geometry) with the kb_program_(computing) outlined in the paper `` do gravitational fields play an important role in the kb_united_states_constitution of the kb_elementary_school kb_subatomic_particle ? '' . these solutions cut and pasted schwarzschild kb_black_holes kb_order_(biology) to incorporate spinning point kb_subatomic_particle into kb_general_(united_states) relativity , the affine connection needed to kb_beryllium generalized to include an antisymmetric part , called the kb_torsion_tensor . this modification was made by kb_albert_einstein and cartan in the 1920s .the kb_theory of kb_general_(united_states) relativity has kb_a fundamental law—the kb_einstein_equations which describe how kb_space curves , the kb_geodesic_equation equation which describes how kb_subatomic_particle move may kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from the kb_einstein_equations .since the equations of kb_general_(united_states) relativity are non-linear , kb_a lump of kb_energy_industry made out of pure gravitational fields , like kb_a kb_black_sea hole , would move on kb_a kb_trajectory which is determined by the kb_einstein_equations themselves , not by kb_a kb_new_world kb_law . kb_sulfate kb_albert_einstein kb_anatolian_hypothesis that the path of kb_a singular kb_solid_solution , like kb_a kb_black_sea hole , would kb_beryllium determined to kb_beryllium kb_a geodesic from kb_general_(united_states) relativity itself .this was established by kb_albert_einstein , infeld , and hoffmann for pointlike kb_object_relations_theory without kb_angular_momentum kb_momentum , and by kb_roy_kerr kerrin kb_a 1905 paper , kb_albert_einstein postulated that kb_light itself consists of localized kb_subatomic_particle ( `` kb_quantum '' ) . kb_albert_einstein 's kb_light kb_quantum were nearly kb_universal_reconciliation rejected by all kb_physicists , including kb_max_planck planck and kb_niels_bohr kb_niels_bohr . this idea only became kb_universal_reconciliation kb_acceptance#self_acceptance in 1919 , with kb_robert_millikan millikan 's detailed experiments on the kb_photoelectric_effect , and with the measurement of kb_compton_scattering scattering .kb_albert_einstein concluded that each kb_wave of kb_frequency `` kb_fluorine '' is associated with kb_a kb_class_(set_theory) of kb_photons with kb_energy_industry `` kb_hydrofluoric_acid '' each , where `` kb_hydrogen '' is planck 's constant . kb_he_(letter) does not say much more , because kb_he_(letter) is not sure how the kb_subatomic_particle are related to the kb_wave . but kb_he_(letter) does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results , notably the kb_photoelectric_effect .in 1907 , kb_albert_einstein kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_a kb_rutherford_model of kb_matter where each kb_atom in kb_a lattice kb_structure is an independent kb_harmonic oscillator . in the kb_albert_einstein kb_rutherford_model , each kb_atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized kb_sovereign_state for each oscillator . kb_albert_einstein was aware that getting the kb_frequency of the actual oscillations would kb_beryllium difficult , but kb_he_(letter) nevertheless kb_anatolian_hypothesis this kb_theory because kb_it was kb_a particularly clear demonstration that kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics could solve the kb_specific_heat kb_heat_(1972_film) problem in kb_classical_mechanics . kb_peter_debye debye refined this kb_rutherford_model .throughout the 1910s , kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics expanded in kb_scope_(mouthwash) to cover many different kb_systems_analysis . after kb_ernest_rutherford rutherford discovered the kb_atomic_nucleus and kb_anatolian_hypothesis that electrons orbit like planets , kb_niels_bohr kb_niels_bohr was able to show that the same kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics postulates introduced by planck and kb_adaptation by kb_albert_einstein would explain the discrete kb_motion_(physics) of electrons in atoms , and the kb_periodic_table_of_the_elements of the kb_chemical_element .kb_albert_einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments kb_wilhelm_wien wien had made . wien had shown that the hypothesis of kb_adiabatic_invariant of kb_a kb_thermal_equilibrium kb_state_of_matter allows all the kb_blackbody_radiation curves at different kb_temperature to kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) another by kb_a kb_wien's_displacement_law process . kb_albert_einstein noted in kb_1911_in_argentine_football that the same kb_adiabatic kb_principle_(chemistry) shows that the kb_quantity which is quantized in any kb_mechanics kb_motion_(physics) must kb_beryllium an kb_adiabatic kb_invariant_(mathematics) . kb_arnold_sommerfeld sommerfeld kb_interpretatio_graeca this kb_adiabatic kb_invariant_(mathematics) as the kb_action-angle_variables variable of kb_classical_mechanics .in 1924 , kb_albert_einstein received kb_a description of kb_a kb_statistical_model from kb_indian_people kb_physicist kb_satyendra_nath_bose nath bose , based on kb_a counting method that assumed that kb_light could kb_beryllium understood as kb_a kb_gas of indistinguishable kb_subatomic_particle . kb_albert_einstein noted that bose 's kb_statistics kb_applied_science to some atoms as kb_water_well as to the kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_light kb_subatomic_particle , and submitted kb_histidine kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century of bose 's paper to the `` kb_zeitschrift_für_physik für physik '' . kb_albert_einstein also published kb_histidine own kb_article_(grammar) describing the kb_rutherford_model and its implications , among them the kb_bose–einstein_condensate condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures . kb_it was not until kb_1995_davis_cup that the kb_first_trimester such condensate was produced experimentally by kb_eric_allin_cornell allin kb_cornell_university and kb_carl_wieman wieman using kb_ultracold_atom equipment built at the nist–jila kb_laboratory at the kb_university_of_colorado_at_boulder kb_colorado at boulder . kb_bose–einstein_statistics kb_statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosonsalthough the kb_patent kb_office promoted kb_albert_einstein to technical examiner kb_second_language kb_class_(biology) in 1906 , kb_he_(letter) had not given up on kb_academia . in 1908 , kb_he_(letter) became kb_a `` kb_privatdozent '' ) , on the kb_quantization_(physics) of kb_light , and in an kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet 1909 paper , kb_albert_einstein showed that kb_max_planck planck 's kb_energy_industry kb_quantum must have well-defined kb_momentum and act in some respects as independent , kb_point_particle kb_subatomic_particle . this paper introduced the `` kb_photon '' kb_concept ( although the kb_toponymy `` kb_photon '' was introduced later by kb_gilbert_n._lewis kb_noun kb_meriwether_lewis in 1926 ) and inspired the notion of kb_wave–particle_duality duality in kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics . kb_albert_einstein saw this kb_wave–particle_duality duality in kb_radiation as kb_concrete kb_evidence_(law) for kb_histidine conviction that kb_physics needed kb_a kb_new_world , unified kb_foundation_(engineering) .in kb_a series of works completed from kb_1911_in_argentine_football to 1913 , planck reformulated kb_histidine 1900 kb_quantum_mechanics kb_theory and introduced the idea of zero-point kb_energy_industry in kb_histidine `` kb_second_language kb_quantum_mechanics kb_theory '' . soon , this idea attracted the attention of kb_albert_einstein and kb_histidine kb_google_assistant kb_otto_stern stern . assuming the kb_energy_industry of rotating kb_diatomic_molecule molecules contains zero-point kb_energy_industry , they then compared the kb_scientific_theory kb_specific_heat kb_heat_(1972_film) of kb_hydrogen kb_gas with the experimental kb_big_data . the kb_grammatical_number matched nicely . however , after publishing the findings , they promptly withdrew their support , because they no longer had kb_confidence_and_supply in the correctness of the idea of zero-point kb_energy_industry .in 1917 , at the height of kb_histidine kb_cold_working on relativity , kb_albert_einstein published an article in `` physikalische zeitschrift '' that kb_anatolian_hypothesis the possibility of kb_stimulated_emission kb_emission_spectra , the kb_health process that makes possible the kb_maser and the kb_laser .this article showed that the kb_statistics of absorption and kb_emission_spectra of kb_light would only kb_beryllium kb_consistent with planck 's distribution kb_law if the kb_emission_spectra of kb_light into kb_a kb_musical_mode with kb_neutron kb_photons would kb_beryllium enhanced kb_statistical_physics compared to the kb_emission_spectra of kb_light into an kb_empty_string kb_musical_mode . this paper was enormously influential in the later development of kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics , because kb_it was the kb_first_trimester paper to show that the kb_statistics of kb_atomic_radius kb_atomic_electron_transition had kb_simple_polygon laws .kb_albert_einstein discovered kb_louis_de_broglie kb_broglie,_eure 's kb_cold_working and kb_catalyst_support kb_histidine kb_idea , which were received skeptically at kb_first_trimester . in another kb_major_(united_states) paper from this era , kb_albert_einstein gave kb_a kb_wave equation for kb_matter_wave , which kb_albert_einstein suggested was the kb_hamilton–jacobi_equation equationkb_albert_einstein was displeased with kb_modern_history kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics as kb_it had kb_evolution_of_tetrapods after 1925. contrary to popular belief , kb_histidine doubts were not due to kb_a conviction that kb_god `` is not playing at kb_dice . '' indeed , kb_it was kb_albert_einstein himself , in kb_histidine 1917 paper that kb_anatolian_hypothesis the possibility of kb_stimulated_emission kb_emission_spectra the bohr–einstein kb_lincoln–douglas_debates were kb_a series of kb_state_school disputes about kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics between kb_albert_einstein and kb_niels_bohr kb_niels_bohr , kb_world_health_organization were kb_2_(number) of its founders . their kb_lincoln–douglas_debates are remembered because of their importance to the kb_philosophy_of_science kb_science . their kb_lincoln–douglas_debates would influence later kb_interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics of kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics .in 1935 , kb_albert_einstein returned kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics , in kb_particular to the kb_question of its completeness , in the `` epr paper '' . in kb_a kb_einstein's_thought_experiments kb_experiment , kb_he_(letter) considered kb_2_(number) kb_subatomic_particle which had interacted such that their kb_chemical_property were strongly correlated . no kb_matter how far the kb_2_(number) kb_subatomic_particle were separated , kb_a precise kb_positional_notation measurement on kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_particle would result in equally precise kb_knowledge_representation of the kb_positional_notation of the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle ; likewise kb_a precise kb_momentum measurement of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_particle would result in equally precise kb_knowledge_representation of the kb_momentum of the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle , without needing to disturb the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle in any way .given kb_albert_einstein 's kb_concept of kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism , there were kb_2_(number) possibilities : ( 1 ) either the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle had these kb_chemical_property already determined , or ( kb_alkaline_earth_metal ) the process of measuring the kb_first_trimester kb_grammatical_particle instantaneously affected the kb_reality of the kb_positional_notation and kb_momentum of the kb_second_language kb_grammatical_particle . kb_albert_einstein rejected this kb_second_language possibility ( kb_folk_etymology called `` spooky action at kb_a kb_distance '' ) .kb_albert_einstein 's belief in kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism kb_light-emitting_diode him to assert that , while the correctness of kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics was not in kb_question , kb_it must kb_beryllium incomplete . but as kb_a kb_health kb_principle_(chemistry) , kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism was shown to kb_beryllium incorrect when the kb_aspect_experiment of kb_1982_world_rally_championship_season kb_confirmation kb_bell 's kb_theorem , which kb_j._s._bell s. kb_bell had delineated in 1964. the results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that kb_quantum_physics kb_physics can not kb_beryllium represented by any version of the picture of kb_physics in which `` kb_subatomic_particle are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities , each kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_being unable to communicate with the kb_other_(philosophy) after they have separated . ''although kb_albert_einstein was wrong about kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism , kb_histidine clear prediction of the unusual kb_chemical_property of its kb_phyllotaxis , `` entangled quantum kb_sovereign_state '' , has resulted in the epr paper becoming among the top ten papers published in kb_physical_review . kb_it is considered kb_a centerpiece of the development of kb_quantum_information_theory kb_information_theory .following kb_histidine kb_research on kb_general_(united_states) relativity , kb_albert_einstein entered into kb_a series of attempts to generalize kb_histidine kb_geometry kb_theory_of_gravitation gravitation to include kb_electromagnetism as another kb_grammatical_aspect of kb_a kb_single_bond entity . in 1950 , kb_he_(letter) described kb_histidine `` kb_unified_field_theory kb_field_theory_(mathematics) kb_theory '' in kb_a `` kb_scientific_method kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) '' article titled `` on the generalized kb_theory_of_gravitation gravitation '' . although kb_he_(letter) continued to kb_beryllium lauded for kb_histidine kb_cold_working , kb_albert_einstein became increasingly kb_isolationism in kb_histidine kb_research , and kb_histidine efforts were ultimately unsuccessful .in kb_histidine pursuit of kb_a unification of the fundamental kb_afsharid_dynasty , kb_albert_einstein ignored some kb_mainstream_(terminology) developments in kb_physics , most notably the kb_strong_nuclear_force and weak nuclear kb_afsharid_dynasty , which were not kb_water_well understood until many years after kb_death_of_alexander_the_great . kb_mainstream_(terminology) kb_physics , in kb_turn_(geometry) , largely ignored kb_albert_einstein 's approaches to unification . kb_albert_einstein 's dream of unifying kb_other_(philosophy) laws of kb_physics with kb_gravity_(2013_film) motivates kb_modern_history quests for kb_a kb_theory_of_everything everything and in kb_particular kb_string_theory kb_theory , where geometrical fields emerge in kb_a unified quantum-mechanical setting .kb_albert_einstein conducted kb_other_(philosophy) investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned . these pertain to kb_force , kb_superconductivityin kb_addition to longtime collaborators kb_leopold_infeld infeld , kb_nathan_rosen rosen , kb_peter_bergmann bergmann and others , kb_albert_einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various kb_science .kb_albert_einstein and kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the kb_motion_(physics) of electrons ,

needed to kb_beryllium sensitive , because the kb_angular_momentum kb_momentum associated with electrons is small , but kb_it definitively established that kb_electron kb_motion_(physics) of some kind is responsible for magnetization .kb_albert_einstein suggested to kb_erwin_schrödinger kb_erwin_schrödinger that kb_he_(letter) might kb_beryllium able to reproduce the kb_statistics of kb_a kb_bose–einstein_condensate kb_gas by considering kb_a box . then to each possible quantum kb_motion_(physics) of kb_a kb_grammatical_particle in kb_a box associate an independent kb_harmonic

kb_histidine former student kb_leó_szilárd szilárd co-invented ( and in 1930 , kb_patented ) the kb_einstein_refrigerator . this kb_absorption_refrigerator refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only kb_heat_(1972_film) as an input . on 11 november 1930 , was awarded to kb_albert_einstein and kb_leó_szilárd szilárd for the refrigerator . their invention was not immediately put into commercial production , and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the kb_sweden company kb_electrolux .while kb_traveling , kb_albert_einstein wrote daily to

. the majority of kb_modern_history scholars subscribe to the latter kb_theory , and view the kb_loanword hypothesis with kb_skepticism .kb_cognates of the kb_toponymy `` allāh '' exist in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_semitic_languages , including kb_hebrew_alphabet and kb_aramaic_alphabet . the corresponding kb_aramaic_alphabet kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism is `` kb_names_of_god_in_judaism#elah '' ( ) , but its kb_emphatic_consonant kb_state_of_matter is `` elaha '' ( ) . kb_it is written as ( `` ʼĕlāhā '' ) in kb_biblical_aramaic and ( `` ʼalâhâ '' ) in kb_syriac_alphabet as used by the kb_assyrian_christians , both kb_meaning_(linguistics) simply `` kb_god '' . kb_biblical_hebrew mostly uses the plural ( but functional singular ) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` kb_elohim '' ( ) , but more rarely kb_it also uses the singular kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` eloah '' ( ) .kb_regional_power variants of

regarding the role of kb_allah in kb_pre-islamic_arabia kb_polytheism cults . some authors have suggested that polytheistic kb_arabs used the kb_toponymy as kb_a reference to kb_a kb_creator_god kb_god or kb_a kb_god kb_deity of their kb_pantheon_(religion) . the kb_terminology may have been vague in the kb_mecca kb_religion . according to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hypothesis , which goes back to kb_julius_wellhausen wellhausen , kb_allah ( the kb_god kb_deity of the tribal federation around kb_quraysh ) was kb_a designation that consecrated the superiority of kb_hubal ( the kb_god kb_deity of kb_quraysh ) over the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_deity . however , there is also kb_evidence_(law) that kb_allah and kb_hubal were kb_2_(number) distinct kb_deities . according to that hypothesis , the kb_kaaba was kb_first_trimester consecrated to kb_a kb_god kb_deity kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_allah and then hosted the kb_pantheon_(religion) of kb_quraysh after their kb_umayyad_conquest_of_hispania of kb_mecca , about kb_a century before the kb_time_(magazine) of kb_muhammad . some kb_inscriptiones_graecae seem to indicate the use of kb_allah as kb_a kb_toponymy of kb_a kb_polytheism kb_deity kb_century_(cricket) kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet , but we kb_know_nothing nothing precise about this use . some scholars have suggested that kb_allah may have represented kb_a remote kb_creator_god kb_god kb_world_health_organization was gradually kb_eclipsed by more particularized local kb_deities . there is disagreement on whether kb_allah played kb_a kb_major_(united_states) role in the meccan kb_religion kb_cult_(religious_practice) . no iconic kb_representation_(arts) of kb_allah is known to have existed . kb_allah is the only kb_god in kb_mecca that did not have an idol . kb_muhammad 's kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) 's kb_toponymy was kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` the slave of allāh '' .the kb_aramaic_alphabet word for `` kb_god '' in the kb_hunnic_language of kb_assyrian_christians is `` ʼĕlāhā '' , or `` alaha '' . arabic-speakers of all abrahamic faiths , including kb_christianity and kb_jews , use kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_allah '' to kb_mean `` kb_god '' . the kb_christianity kb_arabs of today have no kb_other_(philosophy) word for `` kb_god '' than `` kb_allah '' . ( even the arabic-descended kb_maltese_language kb_hunnic_language of kb_malta , whose kb_population is almost entirely kb_catholic_church , uses `` alla '' for `` kb_god '' . ) kb_arab_christians , for example , use the terms ' ( ) for kb_god_the_father kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , ' ( ) for kb_son_of_god son , and `` '' ( ) for kb_holy_spirit_in_christianity kb_holy_spirit kb_spirit .

''in kb_islam_and_abortion kb_tradition , there are kb_99_names_of_god names of kb_god ( `` '' lit . kb_meaning_(linguistics) : 'the best names ' or 'the most beautiful names ' ) , each of which evoke kb_a distinct kb_characteristic_(algebra) of kb_allah . all these names refer to kb_allah , the supreme and all-comprehensive kb_divinity kb_toponymy . among the kb_99_names_of_god names of kb_god , the most famous and most frequent of these names are `` the merciful '' ( `` kb_rahman_(name) '' ) and `` the compassionate '' ( `` '' ) .most kb_islam use the untranslated kb_arabic_alphabet phrase `` '' ( kb_meaning_(linguistics) 'if kb_god kb_will_(law) ' ) after references to future events . kb_muslim discursive kb_piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of `` '' ( kb_meaning_(linguistics) 'in the kb_toponymy of kb_god ' ) .there are certain phrases in praise of kb_god that are favored by kb_islam , including `` '' ( holiness kb_beryllium to kb_god ) , `` '' ( praise kb_beryllium to kb_god ) , `` '' ( there is no kb_deity but kb_god ) and `` '' ( kb_god is greater ) as kb_a devotional exercise of remembering kb_god ( kb_dhikr ) . in kb_a kb_sufi practice known as `` kb_dhikr kb_allah '' ( lit . remembrance of kb_god ) , the kb_sufi repeats and contemplates on the kb_toponymy `` kb_allah '' or kb_other_(philosophy) kb_divinity names while controlling kb_histidine or her breath .according to gerhard böwering , in kb_contrast_(vision) with kb_pre-islamic_arabia kb_arabian_plate kb_polytheism , kb_god_in_islam kb_islam does not have associates and companions , nor is there any kb_kinship between kb_god and kb_jinn . kb_pre-islamic_arabia kb_paganism kb_arabs believed in kb_a kb_blindness , powerful , inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control . this was replaced with the islamic notion of kb_a powerful but provident and merciful kb_god .according to kb_francis_edward_peters edward peters , `` the qur ’ ān insists , kb_islam kb_believe_(tv_series) , and historians affirm that kb_muhammad and kb_histidine followers kb_achilles#worship the same kb_god as the kb_jews ( ) . the qur ’ an 's kb_allah is the same kb_creator_god kb_god kb_world_health_organization covenanted with kb_abraham '' . peters kb_sovereign_state that the kb_quran portrays kb_allah as both more powerful and more remote than kb_yahweh , and as kb_a kb_universal_studios kb_deity , unlike kb_yahweh kb_world_health_organization closely follows kb_jews .in kb_order_(biology) to pronounce kb_the_word_(free_love) word kb_allah correctly , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) has to focus on the kb_second_language “ l ” ( ل ) in kb_allah ( الله ) . when kb_the_word_(free_love) word kb_allah is preceded by the kb_vowel “ kb_a ” ( فَتْحة ) or the kb_vowel “ kb_atomic_mass_unit ” ( ضَمّة ) , then the lām is pronounced in kb_a distinct heavy manner – with tafkhīm . this heavy lām is thus articulated with the entire kb_human_body of the tongue rather than its tip alone . for example , kb_ayah 58:22 : “ man haddaallah ” ( ِمَنْ حَادَّ الله ) which means : those kb_world_health_organization oppose kb_allah .if , however , the preceding kb_vowel is “ kb_iodine ” ( كَسْرة ) , then the lām in kb_allah is kb_light , such as in the kb_basmala : bismillahi ... ( ِبِسْمِ الله الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ ) . kb_sulfate if kb_a kb_muslim says “ bismillahi ” , kb_he_(letter) should not pronounce the lām with kb_a heavy kb_emphasis_(typography) – instead , just with the tip of the tongue .the kb_history of the kb_toponymy `` allāh '' in kb_australian_english was probably influenced by the kb_science of kb_comparative_religion kb_religion in the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century ; for example , kb_thomas_carlyle ( 1840 ) sometimes used the kb_terminology kb_allah but without any kb_entailment that kb_allah was anything different from kb_god . however , in kb_histidine kb_biography of muḥammad ( 1934 ) , kb_tor_andræ andræ always used the kb_terminology `` kb_allah '' , though kb_he_(letter) allows that this `` kb_human_fertilization of kb_god '' seems to imply that kb_it is different from that of the kb_jews and kb_christianity theologies .languages which may not commonly use the kb_terminology `` kb_allah '' to denote kb_god may still contain popular expressions which use kb_the_word_(free_love) word . for example , because of the kb_century_(cricket) kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_al-andalus in the kb_iberian_peninsula , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` ojalá '' in the kb_spanish_empire kb_hunnic_language and `` oxalá '' in the kb_portuguese_language exist today , kb_loanword from kb_arabic_alphabet `` kb_inshalla '' ( kb_arabic_alphabet : إن شاء الله ) . this phrase literally means 'if kb_god kb_will_(law) ' ( in the kb_word_sense of `` kb_iodine hope kb_sulfate '' ) . the kb_german_language kb_poet kb_siegfried_august_mahlmann used the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` kb_allah '' as the kb_title of kb_a poem about the ultimate kb_deity , though kb_it is unclear how much kb_judeo-islamic_philosophies_(800–1400) thought kb_he_(letter) kb_intention to convey .some kb_islam leave the kb_toponymy `` allāh '' untranslated in kb_australian_english . kb_the_word_(free_love) word has also been kb_applied_science to certain living kb_human_kind as kb_anthropomorphismkb_christianity in kb_malaysia and kb_indonesia use `` kb_allah '' to refer to kb_god in the kb_malaysian_language and kb_indonesian_language languages ( both of them standardized kb_theory_of_forms of the kb_malay_language ) . kb_mainstream_(terminology) kb_bible translations in the kb_hunnic_language use `` kb_allah '' as the kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century of kb_hebrew_alphabet `` kb_elohim '' ( translated in kb_australian_english kb_bibles as `` kb_god '' ) . this goes back to early kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century kb_cold_working by kb_francis_xavier xavier in the 16th century . the kb_first_trimester dictionary of dutch-malay by kb_albert_speer_(born_1934) cornelius ruyl , justus heurnius , and caspar wiltens in 1650 ( revised edition from 1623 edition and 1631 kb_latin edition ) recorded `` kb_allah '' as the kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century of the kb_dutch_language word `` kb_:en:god '' . ruyl also translated the kb_gospel_of_matthew matthew in 1612 into the kb_malay_language ( an early kb_bible kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century into kb_a non-european kb_hunnic_language ,made kb_a year after the publication of the kb_king_james_version version ) , which was printed in kb_netherlands kb_netherlands in 1629. then kb_he_(letter) translated the kb_gospel_of_mark kb_mark_waugh , published in 1638 .the kb_government_of_malaysia kb_malaysia in kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final outlawed usage of the kb_terminology `` kb_allah '' in any kb_other_(philosophy) but kb_muslim contexts , but the kb_high_court_of_malaya kb_high_middle_ages kb_court in kb_2009_in_science kb_massachusetts_government_act kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law , ruling kb_it kb_constitutionality . while `` kb_allah '' had been used for the kb_christianity kb_god in kb_malay_language for more than four kb_century_(cricket) , the contemporary kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war was triggered by usage of `` kb_allah '' by the kb_catholic_church newspaper `` the herald '' . the kb_government_of_angola appealed the kb_court ruling , and the kb_high_middle_ages kb_court suspended implementation of its verdict until the kb_hearing_loss of the kb_appeal . in kb_october kb_2013_mediterranean_games the kb_court ruled in favor of the kb_government_of_angola 's kb_ban_(unit) . in early 2014 the kb_malaysian_language kb_government_of_angola confiscated more than 300 kb_bibles for using kb_the_word_(free_love) word to refer to the kb_christianity kb_god in peninsular kb_malaysia . however , the use of `` kb_allah '' is not prohibited in the kb_2_(number) kb_malaysian_language kb_sovereign_state of kb_sabah and kb_sarawak . the main kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving kb_it is not prohibited in these kb_2_(number) kb_sovereign_state is that usage has been long-established and local alkitab ( kb_bibles ) have been widely distributed freely in kb_east_africa kb_malaysia without restrictions for years . both kb_sovereign_state also do not have similar islamic kb_state_of_matter laws as those in kb_west_malaysia .in reaction to some kb_medes criticism , the kb_malaysian_language kb_government_of_angola has introduced kb_a `` 10-point

literally translates from kb_avestan as `` we kb_achilles#worship the kb_fravashi of the holy kb_atropatene .

kb_roman_empire between 900–700 bc , which was integrated into the kb_achaemenid_empire around 550 bc . the kb_area was kb_muslim_conquests_of_afghanistan by the achaemenids leading to the kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) of kb_zoroastrianism . later kb_it became part of kb_alexander_the_great great 's kb_roman_empire and its successor , the kb_seleucid_empire . during this period , kb_zoroastrianism kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) in the kb_caucasus and kb_atropatene . caucasian kb_albanians , the original inhabitants of kb_northern_mountain_range_(albania) kb_azerbaijan ,

kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_tribal_chief kb_vassals of the sasanian kb_byzantine_emperors , the kb_albanians kb_king had only kb_a semblance of kb_authority , and the sasanian kb_marzban

such as the kb_sallarid_dynasty , kb_sajid_dynasty , and kb_shaddadids . at kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the 11th century , the kb_territories_of_the_united_states was gradually seized by

the kb_area now known as kb_azerbaijan by 1067 .the pre-turkic kb_population that lived on the kb_territories_of_the_united_states of kb_modern_history kb_azerbaijan spoke several kb_indo-european_languages and caucasian languages , among them kb_armenian_language and an iranian kb_hunnic_language , kb_old_azeri_language , which was gradually replaced by kb_a kb_turkic_languages , the early precursor of the kb_azerbaijani_language of today . some kb_linguistics have also stated that the kb_tat_language_(caucasus) dialects of kb_azerbaijan_(iran) kb_azerbaijan and the kb_republic_of_azerbaijan kb_azerbaijan , like those spoken by the kb_tat_people_(caucasus) , are descended from kb_old_azeri_language . locally , the possessions of the subsequent kb_seljuk_empire were ruled by kb_eldiguzids , kb_de_jure kb_vassals of the kb_seljuk_(warlord) sultans , but sometimes `` kb_de_facto '' rulers themselves . under the seljuks , local poets such as kb_nizami_ganjavi and kb_khaqani gave rise to kb_a blossoming of kb_persian_literature on the kb_territories_of_the_united_states of present-day kb_azerbaijan .the local kb_dynasty of the shirvanshahs became kb_a kb_vassal_state of kb_timur 's kb_roman_empire , and assisted him in kb_histidine kb_war with the ruler of the kb_golden_horde kb_tokhtamysh . following kb_timur 's kb_death ,

kb_suzerainty , until 1538 , when kb_safavid_dynasty kb_king kb_tahmasp_i kb_iodine ( r. 1524–1576 ) completely deposed them , and made the kb_area into the kb_safavid_dynasty kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands of kb_shirvan . the kb_sunni kb_ottoman_empire briefly managed to occupy parts of present-day kb_azerbaijan as kb_a result of the kb_ottoman-safavid_war_(1578-1590) kb_war of 1578–1590 ; by the early 17th century , they were ousted by kb_safavid_dynasty iranian ruler kb_abbas_i_of_persia kb_iodine ( r. 1588–1629 ) . in the kb_wake_(ceremony) of the demise of the kb_safavid_dynasty kb_roman_empire , kb_baku and its environs were briefly kb_dutch_loango-angola by the kb_russian_diaspora as kb_a consequence of the kb_russo-persian_war_(1722–23) kb_war of

kb_area . the rulers of these khanates were directly related to the ruling dynasties of kb_iran , and were kb_vassals and kb_british_subject of the iranian kb_shah . the khanates exercised control over their affairs via international kb_trade routes between kb_central_asia and the kb_western_culture .thereafter , the kb_area was under the successive rule of the iranian zands and kb_qajar_dynasty . from the late kb_18th_century century , kb_ottoman_empire kb_russian_empire switched to kb_a more aggressive geo-political stance towards its kb_2_(number) neighbors and rivals to the kb_southern_africa , namely kb_iran and the kb_ottoman_empire . kb_russian_empire now actively tried to gain possession of the kb_caucasus kb_region which was , for the most part , in the hands of kb_iran . in 1804 , the kb_russian_diaspora kb_battle_of_ganja_(1804) and sacked the iranian town of kb_ganja,_azerbaijan , sparking the kb_russo-persian_war_(1804–13) kb_war of 1804–1813following kb_qajar_dynasty kb_iran 's loss in the 1804–1813 kb_war , kb_it was forced to concede kb_suzerainty over most of the khanates , along with kb_georgia_(u.s._state) and kb_dagestan to the kb_russian_empire , per the kb_treaty_of_gulistan gulistan .the kb_area to the kb_north of the kb_river kb_aras_(river) , amongst which kb_territories_of_the_united_states lies the contemporary kb_republic_of_azerbaijan kb_azerbaijan , was iranian kb_territories_of_the_united_states until kb_it was kb_dutch_loango-angola by kb_russian_empire in the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century . about kb_a decade later , in violation of the gulistan kb_treaty_of_margus , the kb_russian_diaspora invaded kb_iran 's kb_erivan_khanate kb_khanates_of_the_caucasus . this sparked the final bout of hostilities between the kb_2_(number) , the kb_russo-persian_war_(1826-1828) kb_war of 1826–1828 . the resulting kb_treaty_of_turkmenchay turkmenchay , forced kb_qajar_dynasty kb_iran to cede kb_sovereignty over the kb_erivan_khanate kb_khanates_of_the_caucasus , the kb_nakhchivan_khanate and the remainder of the kb_lankaran_khanate , comprising the last parts of the kb_soil of the contemporary

kb_border_crossings_of_albania between the kb_2_(number) was kb_set_(mythology) at the kb_aras_river , which , upon the kb_soviet_union 's disintegration , subsequently became part of the kb_border_crossings_of_albania between kb_iran and the kb_azerbaijan kb_republic .kb_qajar_dynasty kb_iran was forced to cede its caucasian kb_territories_of_the_united_states to kb_russian_empire in the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century , which thus included the kb_territories_of_the_united_states of the modern-day kb_azerbaijan kb_republic , while as kb_a result of that cession , the kb_azerbaijanis kb_group_(periodic_table) is nowadays parted between kb_2_(number) nations : kb_iran and kb_azerbaijan . nevertheless , the kb_grammatical_number of kb_ethnicity kb_azerbaijani_people in kb_iran far outnumber those in neighbouring kb_azerbaijan .after the kb_russian_revolution of the kb_russian_empire during kb_world_war_ii kb_war kb_iodine , the short-lived kb_transcaucasian_democratic_federative_republic kb_democratic_party_(united_states) federative kb_republic was declared , constituting the present-day republics of kb_azerbaijan , kb_georgia_(u.s._state) , and kb_armenia .kb_it was followed by the kb_march_days massacres that took kb_place_of_articulation between 30 kb_march and kb_alkaline_earth_metal april 1918 in kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_baku and adjacent areas of the kb_baku_governorate of the kb_russian_empire . when the kb_republic kb_fall_of_communism_in_albania in may 1918 , the leading kb_musavat party declared kb_independence as the kb_azerbaijan_democratic_republic kb_republic ( adr ) , adopting the kb_toponymy of `` kb_azerbaijan '' for the kb_the_new_republic ; kb_a kb_toponymy that kb_prior to the kb_dunmore's_proclamation of the adr was solely used to refer to the adjacent kb_iranian_azerbaijan of contemporary kb_iran . the adr was the kb_first_trimester kb_modern_history kb_parliamentary_republic in the kb_muslim_world . among the important accomplishments of the kb_parliamentary_democracy was the kb_extension_(kinesiology) of kb_suffrage to women , making kb_azerbaijan the kb_first_trimester kb_muslim nation to kb_ulysses_s._grant women equal kb_politics kb_catalan_constitutions with men . another important accomplishment of adr was the establishment of kb_baku_state_university kb_aarhus_university by kb_march 1920 , kb_it was obvious that kb_russian_soviet_federative_socialist_republic would attack kb_baku . kb_vladimir_lenin lenin said that the invasion was justified as kb_russian_soviet_federative_socialist_republic could not survive without kb_baku 's kb_palm_oil . independent kb_azerbaijan lasted only 23 months until the kb_bolshevik kb_11th_soviet_red_army kb_soviet_union kb_red_army invaded kb_it , establishing the kb_azerbaijan_soviet_socialist_republic on 28 april 1920. although the bulk of the newly formed kb_azerbaijani_language kb_british_army was engaged in putting down an kb_armenian_language kb_history_of_the_albanian-turkish_wars that had just broken out in kb_karabakh , kb_azerbaijani_people did not surrender their brief kb_independence of 1918–20 quickly or easily . as many as 20,000 kb_azerbaijani_language soldiers died resisting what was effectively kb_a kb_russian_alphabet reconquest .on kb_boron_group kb_october 1921 , the kb_soviet_union republics of kb_russian_empire , kb_armenia , kb_azerbaijan , and kb_georgia_(u.s._state) signed an kb_agreement_(linguistics) with kb_turkey known

policy of the kb_soviet_union , with 80 percent of the kb_soviet_union 's kb_palm_oil on the kb_eastern_front_(world_war_ii) kb_being supplied by kb_baku . by the kb_decree of the kb_supreme_soviet_of_the_ussr kb_soviet_union of the kb_soviet_union in kb_february_revolution 1942 , the kb_personal_commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the kb_petroleum_industry of

kb_permanent_autonomous_zone kb_region of the kb_azerbaijan_soviet_socialist_republic . the disturbances in kb_azerbaijan , in response to kb_moscow_governorate 's indifference to an already heated

not kb_beryllium their kb_primary_education goal , some amateur astronomers make contributions in doing kb_citizen_science , such as by monitoring kb_variable_stars stars , kb_double_stars stars sunspots , or occultations of stars by the kb_moon or kb_asteroids , or by discovering transient kb_astronomical events , such as comets , galactic novae or kb_supernovae in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_galaxy .amateur astronomers do not use the field of kb_astronomy as their kb_primary_education source of kb_income or support , and usually have no kb_professional_degree kb_degree_(angle) in kb_astrophysics or advanced academic kb_military_education_and_training in the kb_grammatical_subject . most kb_amateurs are beginners or hobbyists , while others have kb_a kb_high_middle_ages kb_degree_(angle) of experience in kb_astronomy and may often assist and kb_cold_working alongside professional astronomers . many astronomers have studied the kb_sky throughout kb_history in an amateur framework ; however , since kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the twentieth century , professional kb_astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy and associated activities .amateur astronomers typically view the kb_sky at night , when most celestial kb_object_relations_theory and kb_astronomical events are visible , but others observe during the daytime by viewing the kb_sun and solar eclipses . some just kb_look_(american_magazine) at the kb_sky using nothing more than their eyes or kb_binoculars , but more dedicated kb_amateurs often use portable kb_optical_telescope or kb_optical_telescope kb_situated in their kb_private_aviation or club kb_observatory . kb_amateurs can also join as members of amateur kb_astronomical_societycollectively , amateur astronomers observe kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of celestial kb_object_relations_theory and kb_phenomenon . common targets of amateur astronomers include the kb_moon , planets , stars , comets , meteor showers , and kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of deep kb_sky kb_object_relations_theory such as kb_star clusters , kb_galaxy , and nebulae . many kb_amateurs like to specialise in observing kb_particular kb_object_relations_theory , types of kb_object_relations_theory , or types of events which kb_interest them . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) branch of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy , amateur kb_astrophotography , involves the taking of photos of the night kb_sky . kb_astrophotography has become more popular with the introduction of far easier to

of kb_infrared kb_optical_filter on conventional kb_optical_telescope , and also the use of kb_radio kb_optical_telescope . some amateur astronomers use home-made kb_radio kb_optical_telescope , while others use kb_radio kb_optical_telescope that were originally built for kb_astronomical kb_research but have since been made kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance for use by kb_amateurs . the kb_one-mile_telescope kb_telescopeamateur astronomers use kb_a range of instruments to kb_science the kb_sky , depending on kb_a combination of their interests and resources . methods include simply looking at the night kb_sky with the kb_naked_eye kb_human_eye , using kb_binoculars , and using kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of optical kb_optical_telescope of varying kb_power_(physics) and quality ,

kb_optical_telescope are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance , kb_new_world and used , but kb_it is also common for amateur astronomers to build ( or commission the building of ) their own custom kb_optical_telescope . some kb_people_(american_magazine) even focus on kb_amateur_telescope_making kb_telescope making as their kb_primary_education kb_interest within the kb_hobby of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy .although specialized and experienced amateur astronomers tend to acquire more specialized and more powerful equipment over kb_time_(magazine) , relatively kb_simple_polygon equipment is often preferred for certain kb_task_(computing) . kb_binoculars , for instance , although generally of lower kb_power_(physics) than the majority of kb_optical_telescope , also tend to provide kb_a wider kb_field_of_view of view , which is preferable for looking at some kb_object_relations_theory in the night kb_sky .amateur astronomers also use kb_star charts that , depending on experience and intentions , may range from kb_simple_polygon planispheres through to detailed charts of very specific areas of the night kb_sky . kb_a range of kb_astronomy software is kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance and used by amateur astronomers , including software that generates maps of the kb_sky , software to assist with kb_astrophotography , kb_observation scheduling software , and software to perform various calculations pertaining to kb_astronomical kb_phenomenon .amateur astronomers often like to keep kb_record_(computer_science) of their kb_observations_(pierre_belon) , which usually takes the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of an observing log . observing logs typically record details about which kb_object_relations_theory were observed and when , as kb_water_well as describing the details that were seen . sketching is sometimes used within logs , and photographic kb_record_(computer_science) of kb_observations_(pierre_belon) have also been used in recent times . the kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) gathered is used to help studies and kb_interaction_(statistics) between amateur astronomers in yearly gatherings . although not professional kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) or credible , kb_it is kb_a way for the kb_hobby lovers to share their kb_new_world sightings and experiences .kb_the_internet kb_internet is an kb_essential_element kb_tool of amateur astronomers . the popularity of imaging among kb_amateurs has kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of kb_world_wide_web sites kb_being written by individuals about their images and equipment . much of the kb_social_interaction of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy occurs on kb_mailing_lists lists or discussion kb_group_(mathematics) . discussion kb_group_(periodic_table) servers host numerous kb_astronomy lists . kb_a great deal of the commerce of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy , the buying and selling of equipment , occurs online . many kb_amateurs use online tools to plan their nightly observing sessions , using tools such as the kb_clear_sky_chart kb_sky chart .while kb_a kb_grammatical_number of interesting celestial kb_object_relations_theory are readily kb_interpretatio_graeca by the kb_naked_eye kb_human_eye , sometimes with the kb_aid of kb_a kb_star_chart , many others are kb_sulfate faint or inconspicuous that technical means are necessary to locate them . although many methods are used in kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy , most are variations of kb_a few specific techniques .kb_star hopping is kb_a method often used by amateur astronomers with low-tech equipment such as kb_binoculars or kb_a manually driven kb_telescope . kb_it involves the use of maps ( or kb_memory ) to locate known landmark stars , and `` hopping '' between them , often with the kb_aid of kb_a kb_finderscope . because of its simplicity , kb_star hopping is kb_a very common method for finding kb_object_relations_theory that are close to naked-eye stars .more advanced methods of locating kb_object_relations_theory in the kb_sky include kb_telescope mounts with `` kb_setting_circles circles '' , which assist with pointing kb_optical_telescope to positions in the kb_sky that are known to contain kb_object_relations_theory of kb_interest , and `` goto kb_optical_telescope '' , which are fully kb_automated kb_optical_telescope that are capable of locating kb_object_relations_theory on demand ( having kb_first_trimester been kb_calibration ) .the kb_advent of kb_battle_of_mobile_(1781) applications for use in kb_smartphones has kb_light-emitting_diode to the creation of many dedicated apps . these apps allow any kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) to easily locate celestial kb_object_relations_theory of kb_interest by simply pointing the kb_smartphone kb_analyzer in that direction in the kb_sky . these apps make use of the inbuilt kb_computer_hardware in the phone , such as kb_gps kb_location_(sign_language) and kb_gyroscope . useful kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) about the pointed kb_space_debris like kb_celestial_coordinates coordinates , the kb_toponymy of the kb_space_debris , its kb_constellation , etc . are provided for kb_a quick reference . some paid versions give more kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) . these apps are gradually getting into regular use during observing , for the alignment process of kb_optical_telescope .kb_setting_circles circles are kb_angular_measurement measurement kb_fish_scale that can kb_beryllium placed on the kb_2_(number) main kb_rotation_around_a_fixed_axis of some kb_optical_telescope . since the widespread adoption of kb_digital_data kb_setting_circles circles , any kb_classical_conditioning engraved setting kb_circle is now specifically kb_interpretatio_graeca as an `` kb_analog_device setting kb_circle '' ( asc ) . by knowing the coordinates of an kb_space_debris ( usually given in kb_equatorial_coordinates coordinates ) , the kb_telescope kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) can use the setting kb_circle to align ( i.e. , point ) the kb_telescope in the appropriate direction before looking through its kb_eyepiece . kb_a computerized setting kb_circle is called kb_a `` kb_digital_data setting kb_circle '' ( dsc ) . although kb_digital_data kb_setting_circles circles can kb_beryllium used to kb_computer_monitor kb_a kb_telescope 's kb_radium and kb_declination coordinates , they are not simply kb_a kb_digital_data read-out of what can kb_beryllium seen on the kb_telescope 's kb_analog_device kb_setting_circles circles . as with go-to kb_optical_telescope , kb_digital_data setting kb_circle computers ( commercial names include kb_argo navis , kb_sky commander , and ngc max ) contain databases of tens of thousands of celestial kb_object_relations_theory and projections of kb_planet positions .to find kb_a celestial kb_space_debris in kb_a kb_telescope equipped with kb_a dsc kb_apollo_guidance_computer , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) does not need to kb_look_(american_magazine) up the specific kb_radium and kb_declination coordinates in kb_a book or kb_other_(philosophy) resource , and then adjust the kb_telescope to those numerical readings . rather , the kb_space_debris is chosen from the kb_electronic_computer database , which kb_causes_of_autism kb_distance values and kb_arrow_(weapon) markers to appear in the kb_computer_monitor that indicate the kb_distance and direction to move the kb_telescope . the kb_telescope is moved until the kb_2_(number) angular kb_distance values reach kb_0_(number) , indicating that the kb_telescope is properly aligned . when both the kb_radium and kb_declination axes are thus `` zeroed out '' , the kb_space_debris should kb_beryllium in the kb_eyepiece . many dscs , like go-to kb_systems_analysis , can also kb_cold_working in conjunction with laptop kb_sky programs .computerized kb_systems_analysis provide the further advantage of kb_computing kb_coordinate kb_precession . traditional printed sources are subtitled by the `` kb_epoch_(astronomy) '' year , which refers to the positions of celestial kb_object_relations_theory at kb_a given kb_time_(magazine) to the nearest year ( e.g. , j2005 , j2007 ) . most such printed sources have been updated for intervals of only about every fifty years ( e.g. , j1900 , j1950 , j2000 ) . computerized sources , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , are able to calculate the kb_right_ascension and kb_declination of the `` kb_epoch_(astronomy) of date '' to the exact instant of kb_observation .goto kb_optical_telescope have become more popular since the 1980s as kb_technology has improved and prices have been kb_redox . with these computer-driven kb_optical_telescope , the kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) typically enters the kb_toponymy of the item of kb_interest and the kb_mechanics of the kb_telescope point the kb_telescope towards that item automatically . they have several notable advantages for amateur astronomers intent on kb_research . for example , goto kb_optical_telescope tend to kb_beryllium faster for locating items of kb_interest than kb_star hopping , allowing more kb_time_(magazine) for studying of the kb_space_debris . goto also allows manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler alt-azimuth kb_telescope mounts , allowing them to produce an overall less expensive kb_decay_product . goto

have recently kb_adaptation kb_telescope kb_systems_analysis that are kb_calibration with the use of built-in kb_gps , decreasing the kb_time_(magazine) kb_it takes to kb_set_(mythology) up kb_a kb_telescope at the start of an observing session .with the development of fast kb_internet in the last part of the 20th century along with advances in kb_apollo_guidance_computer controlled kb_telescope mounts and kb_charge-coupled_device cameras `` remote kb_telescope '' kb_astronomy is now kb_a viable means for amateur astronomers not aligned with kb_major_(united_states) kb_telescope facilities to partake in kb_research and deep kb_sky imaging . this enables anyone to control kb_a kb_telescope kb_a great kb_distance away in kb_a dark kb_location_(sign_language) . the observer can image through the kb_telescope using kb_charge-coupled_device cameras . the kb_digital_data kb_big_data collected by the kb_telescope is then transmitted and displayed to the kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) by means of kb_the_internet kb_internet . an example of kb_a kb_digital_data remote kb_telescope operation for kb_public_domain_(land) via kb_the_internet kb_internet is the kb_bareket_observatory observatory , and there are kb_telescope farms in kb_new_mexico , kb_australia and kb_atacama_desert#astronomical_observatories in kb_chile .amateur astronomers engage in many imaging techniques including kb_film , kb_dslr , kb_lrgb , and kb_charge-coupled_device kb_astrophotography . because kb_charge-coupled_device imagers are kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history , kb_image_processing kb_fish_processingkb_scientific_method kb_research is most often not the `` main '' goal for many amateur astronomers , unlike professional astronomers . kb_cold_working of kb_scientific_method merit is possible , however , and many kb_amateurs successfully contribute to the kb_knowledge_representation kb_base_(chemistry) of professional astronomers . kb_astronomy is sometimes promoted as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the few remaining kb_sciences for which kb_amateurs can still contribute useful kb_big_data . to recognize this , the kb_astronomical_society_of_the_pacific of the kb_pacific_ocean annually gives kb_amateur_achievement_award_of_astronomical_society_of_the_pacific achievement awards for significant contributions to kb_astronomy by kb_amateurs .the majority of kb_scientific_method contributions by amateur astronomers are in the kb_area of kb_big_data kb_class_(set_theory) . in kb_particular , this applies where kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of amateur astronomers with small kb_optical_telescope are more effective than the relatively small kb_grammatical_number of kb_prespa_lake kb_optical_telescope that are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance to professional astronomers . several organizations , such as the kb_american_association_of_variable_star_observers of kb_variable_star kb_star observers , exist to help kb_coordinate these contributions .amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of kb_variable_stars stars and kb_supernovae , helping to track kb_asteroids , and observing occultations to determine both the kb_shape of kb_asteroids and the kb_shape of the kb_terrain_(journal) on the apparent kb_enhanced_data_rates_for_gsm_evolution of the kb_moon as seen from kb_earth . with more advanced equipment , but still cheap in comparison to professional setups , amateur astronomers can kb_measure_(mathematics) the kb_light kb_visible_spectrum emitted from kb_astronomical kb_object_relations_theory , which can yield high-quality kb_scientific_method kb_big_data if the measurements are performed with due care . kb_a relatively recent role for amateur astronomers is searching for overlooked kb_phenomenon ( e.g. , kb_kreutz_sungrazers sungrazers ) in the vast libraries of kb_digital_data images and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_big_data captured by kb_earth and kb_space based kb_observatory , much of which is kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance over kb_the_internet kb_internet .in the kb_past and present , amateur astronomers have played kb_a kb_major_(united_states) role in discovering kb_new_world comets . recently however , funding of projects such as the kb_linear kb_asteroid kb_research and kb_near_earth_asteroid_tracking kb_earth kb_asteroid tracking projects has meant that most comets are now discovered by kb_automated kb_systems_analysis kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) before kb_it is possible for kb_amateurs to kb_episcopal_see them .there are kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of amateur kb_astronomical_society around the kb_world_war_ii , that serve as kb_a meeting point for those interested in kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy . members range from active observers with their own equipment to `` armchair astronomers '' kb_world_health_organization are simply interested in the kb_topic_(linguistics) . kb_society range widely in their goals and activities , which may depend on kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of factors such as geographic kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) , local circumstances , size , and membership . for example , kb_a small local society located in dark countryside may focus on practical observing and kb_star_parties , whereas kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) based in kb_a kb_major_(united_states) kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey might have numerous members but kb_beryllium limited by kb_light_pollution and thus hold regular indoor meetings with guest kb_appledesign_powered_speakers instead . kb_major_(united_states) national or international kb_society generally publish their own kb_academic_journal or kb_newsletter , and some hold kb_prespa_lake multi-day meetings akin to kb_a

entering ) , and kb_tenkan ( turning ) movements ( that redirect the opponent 's attack kb_momentum ) , various types of kb_throw_(grappling) and joint locks .aikido derives mainly from the kb_martial_art kb_art of kb_daitō-ryū_aiki-jūjutsu aiki-jūjutsu , but began to diverge from kb_it in the late 1920s , partly due to ueshiba 's involvement with the kb_oomotokb_the_word_(free_love) word `` aikido '' is formed of kb_triliteral kb_kanji :the kb_terminology `` kb_aiki_(martial_arts_principle) '' does not readily appear in the kb_japanese_film kb_hunnic_language outside the kb_scope_(mouthwash) of kb_budō . this has kb_light-emitting_diode to many possible interpretations of kb_the_word_(free_love) word .the kb_terminology is also found in kb_martial_arts kb_arts such as kb_judo and kb_kendo , and in various non-martial kb_arts , such as kb_japanese_calligraphy ( ) , kb_ikebana ( ) and kb_japanese_tea_ceremonyueshiba kb_adaptation aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older kb_martial_arts kb_arts that kb_he_(letter) had studied . the core kb_martial_art kb_art from which aikido derives is kb_daitō-ryū_aiki-jūjutsu aiki-jūjutsu , which ueshiba studied directly with kb_takeda_sōkaku sōkaku , the reviver of that kb_art . additionally , ueshiba is known to have studied kb_tenjin_shinyo_ryu shin'yō-ryū with tozawa tokusaburō in kb_tokyo in 1901 , kb_yagyū_shingan-ryū yagyū shingan-ryū under nakai masakatsu in kb_sakai,_osaka from 1903 to 1908 , and kb_judo with kiyoichi takagi ( , 1894–1972 ) in kb_tanabe in kb_1911_in_argentine_football .the kb_art of daitō-ryū is the kb_primary_education technical influence on aikido . along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques , ueshiba incorporated kb_military_education_and_training movements with weapons , such as those for the kb_spear ( ) , short kb_stick_fighting ( ) , and perhaps the . however , aikido derives much of its technical kb_structure from the kb_art of swordsmanship ( ) .ueshiba moved to kb_hokkaidōafter ueshiba kb_left-wing_politics kb_hokkaidō in 1919 , kb_he_(letter) kb_methionine and was profoundly influenced by kb_onisaburo_deguchi deguchi , the kb_spirituality kb_leader of the kb_oomoto kb_religion ( kb_a neo-shinto kb_movement_(sign_language) ) in kb_ayabe . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_primary_education features of kb_oomoto is its kb_emphasis_(typography) on the attainment of kb_utopia during kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's kb_life_(magazine) . this was kb_a great influence on ueshiba 's kb_martial_arts kb_arts kb_philosophy of extending kb_love and compassion especially to those kb_world_health_organization seek to harm others . aikido demonstrates this kb_philosophy in its kb_emphasis_(typography) on mastering kb_martial_arts kb_arts kb_sulfate that kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect kb_it . in an kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_optical_resolution , not only is the receiver unharmed , but kb_sulfate is the attacker .in kb_addition to the effect on kb_histidine kb_spirituality growth , the connection with deguchi gave ueshiba kb_azerbaijan_in_the_eurovision_song_contest_2009 to elite kb_politics and kb_military circles as kb_a martial kb_artist . as kb_a result of this exposure , kb_he_(letter) was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students . several of these students would found their own kb_art_movement of aikido .aikido was kb_first_trimester brought to the rest of the kb_world_war_ii in kb_1951_in_literature by kb_minoru_mochizuki mochizuki with kb_a visit to kb_france where kb_he_(letter) introduced aikido techniques to kb_judo students . kb_he_(letter) was followed by kb_tadashi_abe abe in 1952 , kb_world_health_organization came as the official kb_aikikai_hombu hombu representative , remaining in kb_france for seven years . kb_kenji_tomiki tomiki toured with kb_a delegation of various kb_martial_arts kb_arts through 15 kb_continental_dollar kb_sovereign_state of the united kb_sovereign_state in 1953. later that year , kb_koichi_tohei tohei was sent by kb_aikikai_hombu hombu to kb_hawaii for kb_a full year , where kb_he_(letter) kb_set_(mythology) up several kb_dojo . this trip was followed by several further visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the united kb_sovereign_state . the kb_united_kingdom kb_kingdom_(biology) followed in 1955 ; kb_italy in kb_united_states_presidential_election,_1964 by kb_hiroshi_tada tada ; and kb_germany in 1965 by kb_katsuaki_asai asai . designated `` official delegate for kb_europe and kb_africa '' by morihei ueshiba , kb_masamichi_noro noro arrived in kb_france in september 1961. kb_seiichi_sugano sugano was appointed to introduce aikido to kb_australia in 1965. today there are aikido kb_dojo throughout the kb_world_war_ii .the kb_largest_organisms aikido organization is the kb_aikikai_foundation kb_foundation_(engineering) , which remains under the control of the ueshiba kb_family_(biology) . however , aikido has many kb_art_movement , mostly formed by morihei ueshiba 's kb_major_(united_states) students .the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century independent kb_art_movement to emerge were kb_yoseikan_aikido aikido , begun by kb_minoru_mochizuki mochizuki in 1931 , kb_yoshinkan , founded by kb_gozo_shioda in 1955 , and kb_shodokan_aikido aikido , founded by kb_kenji_tomiki tomiki in 1967. the emergence of these kb_art_movement pre-dated ueshiba 's kb_death and did not cause any kb_major_(united_states) upheavals when they were formalized . kb_shodokan_aikido aikido , however , was controversial , since kb_it introduced kb_a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the kb_spirit of aikido .after ueshiba 's kb_death in 1969 , kb_2_(number) more kb_major_(united_states) kb_art_movement kb_declaration_of_independence_of_albania . significant kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war arose with the departure of the kb_aikikai_hombu_dojo kb_dojo 's kb_tribal_chief instructor kb_koichi_tohei tohei , in 1974. tohei kb_left-wing_politics as kb_a result of kb_a disagreement with the son of the founder , kb_kisshomaru_ueshiba ueshiba , kb_world_health_organization at that kb_time_(magazine) headed the kb_aikikai_foundation kb_foundation_(engineering) . the disagreement was over the proper role of `` kb_qi '' development in regular aikido kb_military_education_and_training . after tohei kb_left-wing_politics , kb_he_(letter) formed kb_histidine own kb_carpel , called kb_shin_shin_toitsu_aikido shin toitsu aikido , and the organization that governs kb_it , the kb_ki_society ( `` kb_qi no kenkyūkai '' ) .kb_a final kb_major_(united_states) kb_carpel kb_evolution_of_tetrapods from ueshiba 's retirement in iwama , ibaraki and the teaching kb_methodology of kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_terminology student kb_morihiro_saito saito . kb_it is unofficially referred to as the `` kb_iwama_style kb_carpel '' , and at kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) point kb_a kb_grammatical_number of its followers formed kb_a loose network of schools they called kb_iwama_ryu ryu . although kb_iwama_style kb_carpel practitioners remained part of the aikikai until saito 's kb_death in kb_2002_australian_open , followers of saito subsequently split into kb_2_(number) kb_group_(mathematics) . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) remained with the aikikai and the kb_other_(philosophy) formed the independent kb_shinshin_aikishuren_kai aikishuren kai in kb_2004_summer_olympics around saito 's son kb_hitohiro_saito saitothe kb_science of `` kb_qi '' is an important component of aikido , and its kb_science defies categorization as either `` kb_health '' or `` kb_mental_health '' kb_military_education_and_training , as kb_it encompasses both . the `` kb_kanji '' for `` kb_qi '' normally is written as . kb_it was written as until the kb_tōyō_kanji reforms after kb_world_war_ii kb_war ii , and this older kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism still is seen on occasion .the kb_character_(computing) for `` kb_qi '' is used in everyday kb_japanese_film terms , such as , or . `` kb_qi '' has many meanings , including `` ambience '' , `` kb_mind '' , `` mood '' , and `` intention '' , however , in traditional kb_martial_arts kb_arts kb_it is often used to refer to `` kb_life_(magazine) kb_energy_industry '' . kb_gozo_shioda shioda 's kb_yoshinkan , considered kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the `` hard kb_art_movement '' , largely follows ueshiba 's teachings from before kb_world_war_ii kb_war ii , and surmises that the secret to `` kb_qi '' lies in timing and the kb_application_(computing) of the whole kb_human_body 's kb_strength_of_materials to kb_a kb_single_bond point . in later years , ueshiba 's kb_application_(computing) of `` kb_qi '' in aikido took on kb_a softer , more gentle kb_sentience . this was kb_histidine kb_takemusu kb_aiki_(martial_arts_principle) and many of kb_histidine later students teach about `` kb_qi '' from this perspective . kb_koichi_tohei tohei 's kb_ki_society centers almost exclusively around the kb_science of the kb_empirical_evidence ( albeit subjective ) experience of `` kb_qi '' with students kb_historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_united_states#scholar_survey_results separately in aikido techniques and `` kb_qi '' development .in aikido , as in virtually all kb_japanese_film kb_martial_arts kb_arts , there are both kb_health and kb_mental_health aspects of kb_military_education_and_training . the kb_health kb_military_education_and_training in aikido is diverse , covering both kb_general_(united_states) kb_health kb_fitness_(biology) and kb_physical_exercise , as kb_water_well as specific techniques . because kb_a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of kb_throw_(grappling) , beginners learn how to safely fall or roll . the specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs ; the techniques for kb_defense_(legal) consist of kb_throw_(grappling) and kb_pinning_holdkb_health kb_military_education_and_training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled kb_relaxation_technique , correct kb_movement_(sign_language) of joints such as hips and shoulders , kb_flexibility_(anatomy) , and kb_endurance , with less kb_emphasis_(typography) on kb_strength_training . in aikido , pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements . this distinction can kb_beryllium kb_applied_science to kb_general_(united_states) kb_fitness_(biology) goals for the aikido practitioner .in aikido , specific muscles or kb_muscle kb_group_(mathematics) are not kb_isolationism and worked to improve kb_tone_(linguistics) , kb_mass_(liturgy) , or kb_power_(physics) . aikido-related kb_military_education_and_training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body kb_movement_(sign_language) and kb_formal_balance similar to kb_yoga or kb_pilates . for example , many dojos begin each kb_class_(biology) with , which may include kb_stretching and kb_uke_(martial_arts) ( break falls ) .aikido kb_military_education_and_training is based primarily on kb_2_(number) partners practicing pre-arranged kb_theory_of_forms ( `` kb_kata '' ) rather than freestyle practice . the kb_base_(chemistry) kb_pattern is for the receiver of the technique ( `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' ) to initiate an attack against the kb_grammatical_person kb_world_health_organization applies the technique—the `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , or `` shite '' ( depending on aikido kb_carpel ) , also referred to as `` nage '' ( when applying kb_a throwing technique ) , kb_world_health_organization neutralises this attack with an aikido technique .both halves of the technique , that of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' and that of `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , are considered kb_essential_element to aikido kb_military_education_and_training . both are studying aikido principles of blending and kb_adaptation . `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' learns to blend with and control attacking kb_energy_industry , while `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous , off-balance positions in which `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' places them . this `` receiving '' of the technique is called `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' . `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' continuously seeks to regain kb_formal_balance and cover vulnerabilities ( e.g. , an exposed side ) , while `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' uses kb_positional_notation and timing to keep `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' off-balance and vulnerable . in more advanced kb_military_education_and_training , `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' kb_will_and_testament sometimes apply to regain kb_formal_balance and pin or kb_throw_(grappling) `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' .aikido techniques are usually kb_a kb_defense_(legal) against an attack , kb_sulfate students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to kb_beryllium able to practice aikido with kb_a partner . although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based kb_arts , sincere attacks ( kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_strike_action or an immobilizing grab ) are needed to kb_science correct and effective kb_application_(computing) of technique .many of the of aikido resemble cuts from kb_a kb_sword or kb_other_(philosophy) grasped kb_space_debris , which indicate its origins in techniques kb_intention for kb_weapon kb_combat_(newspaper) . kb_other_(philosophy) techniques , which explicitly appear to kb_beryllium punches ( `` kb_tsuki '' ) , are practiced as thrusts with kb_a kb_knife or kb_sword . kicks are generally reserved for upper-level variations ; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous , and that kicks ( kb_high_middle_ages kicks in kb_particular ) were uncommon during the types of kb_combat_(newspaper) prevalent in kb_feudal kb_japan . some kb_base_(chemistry) strikes include :beginners in kb_particular often practice techniques from grabs , both because they are safer and because kb_it is easier to kb_sentience the kb_energy_industry and lines of kb_force of kb_a hold than kb_a kb_strike_action . some grabs are kb_history kb_derived_trait from kb_being held while trying to draw kb_a kb_katanaaikido makes use of kb_human_body kb_movement_(sign_language) ( `` kb_tai_sabaki sabaki '' ) to blend with `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' . for example , an `` entering '' ( `` kb_irimi '' ) technique consists of movements inward towards `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , while kb_a technique uses kb_a pivoting kb_motion_(physics) .additionally , an technique takes kb_place_of_articulation in front of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , whereas an technique takes kb_place_of_articulation to their side ; kb_a technique is kb_applied_science with kb_motion_(physics) to the front of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , and kb_a version is kb_applied_science with kb_motion_(physics) towards the rear of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , usually by incorporating kb_a turning or pivoting kb_motion_(physics) . finally , most techniques can kb_beryllium performed while in kb_a seated posture ( `` kb_seiza '' ) . techniques where both `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' and `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' are standing are called `` tachi-waza '' , techniques where both start off in `` kb_seiza '' are called `` suwari-waza '' , and techniques performed with `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' standing and `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' sitting are called `` hanmi handachi '' ( ) .thus , from fewer than twenty kb_base_(chemistry) techniques , there are thousands of possible implementations . for instance , `` ikkyō '' can kb_beryllium kb_applied_science to an opponent moving forward with kb_a kb_strike_action ( perhaps with an `` ura '' kb_type_(biology) of kb_movement_(sign_language) to redirect the incoming kb_force ) , or to an opponent kb_world_health_organization has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish kb_distance ( perhaps an `` omote-waza '' version ) . specific aikido `` kb_kata '' are typically referred to with the kb_chemical_formula `` attack-technique ( -modifier ) '' . for instance , `` katate-dori ikkyō '' refers to any `` ikkyō '' technique kb_execution_(computing) when `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' is holding kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_wrist . this could kb_beryllium further specified as `` katate-dori ikkyō omote '' , referring to any forward-moving `` ikkyō '' technique from that grab .`` kb_atemi '' ( ) are strikes ( or feints ) employed during an aikido technique . some view `` kb_atemi '' as attacks against `` kb_pressure_point points '' meant to cause damage in and of themselves . for instance , kb_gozo_shioda shiodaweapons kb_military_education_and_training in aikido traditionally includes the short kb_stick_fighting ( `` kb_jō '' ) although its techniques resemble closely the use of the bayonet or kb_jūkendō , the wooden kb_sword ( `` kb_bokken '' ) , and the kb_knife ( `` kb_tantō '' ) . some schools incorporate firearm-disarming techniques . both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are taught . some schools , such as the kb_iwama_style kb_carpel of kb_morihiro_saito saito , usually spend substantial kb_time_(magazine) practicing with both `` kb_bokken '' and `` kb_jō '' , under the names of `` kb_aiki-ken '' , and `` kb_aiki-jō '' , respectively .the founder kb_adaptation many of the empty-handed techniques from traditional kb_sword , kb_spear and bayonet movements . consequently , the practice of the weapons kb_arts gives insight into the kb_evolution of techniques and movements , and reinforces the concepts of kb_distance , timing , kb_hiking kb_movement_(sign_language) , presence and connectedness with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's kb_military_education_and_training partner ( kb_sulfur ) .kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_i_shot_andy_warhol of aikido is kb_military_education_and_training to defend against kb_cross-platform_software attackers , often called `` taninzudori '' , or `` taninzugake '' . freestyle practice with kb_cross-platform_software attackers called `` kb_randori '' ( ) is kb_a kb_key_(cryptography) part of most curricula and is required for the higher level ranks . `` kb_randori '' exercises kb_a kb_grammatical_person 's ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment . kb_geostrategy kb_utility of techniques , based on how they reposition the student relative to kb_other_(philosophy) attackers , is important in `` kb_randori '' kb_military_education_and_training . for instance , an `` ura '' technique might kb_beryllium used to neutralise the kb_electric_current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind .in kb_shodokan_aikido aikido , `` kb_randori '' differs in that kb_it is not performed with kb_cross-platform_software persons with kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity roles of kb_defender_(video_game) and attacker , but between kb_2_(number) kb_people_(american_magazine) , where both participants attack , defend , and counter at kb_will_and_testament . in this respect kb_it resembles kb_judo `` kb_randori '' .in applying kb_a technique during kb_military_education_and_training , kb_it is the responsibility of `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' to prevent kb_injury to `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' by employing kb_a speed and kb_force of kb_application_(computing) that is commensurate with their partner 's proficiency in `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' . kb_injuries ( especially those to the joints ) , when they do occur in aikido , are often the result of `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' misjudging the ability of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' to receive the kb_throw_(grappling) or pin .kb_a kb_science of kb_injuries in the kb_martial_arts kb_arts showed that the kb_type_(biology) of kb_injuries varied considerably from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_art to the kb_other_(philosophy) .kb_hardness kb_tissue_(biology) kb_injuries are kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the most common types of kb_injuries found within aikido , as kb_water_well as joint kb_strain_(biology) and stubbed fingers and toes . several kb_maternal_death from head-and-neck kb_injuries , caused by aggressive `` shihōnage '' in kb_a kb_senpai_and_kōhaiaikido practitioners ( commonly called `` aikidōka '' outside kb_japan ) generally progress by promotion through kb_a series of `` kb_grade_(education) '' ( `` kb_kyū '' ) , followed by kb_a series of `` kb_degree_(angle) '' ( `` kb_dan_(rank) '' ) , pursuant to formal testing procedures . some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners ' kb_grade_(education) , often simply kb_white_american and kb_black_belt_(martial_arts) to distinguish `` kyu '' and `` kb_dan_(rank) '' kb_grade_(education) , though some use various belt colors . testing kb_requirement_analysis vary , kb_sulfate kb_a kb_particular rank in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another . some dojos do not allow students to kb_take the test to obtain kb_a `` kb_dan_(rank) '' rank unless they are 16 or older .the uniform worn for practicing aikido ( `` kb_aikidogi '' ) is similar to the kb_military_education_and_training uniform ( `` kb_keikogi '' ) used in most kb_other_(philosophy) kb_modern_history kb_martial_arts kb_arts ; kb_simple_polygon trousers and kb_a wraparound jacket , usually kb_white_american . both thick ( `` judo-style '' ) , and thin ( `` karate-style '' ) kb_cotton tops are used . aikido-specific tops are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance with shorter sleeves which reach to just kb_#ecclesiastical_history the kb_elbow_river .most aikido kb_systems_analysis add kb_a pair of wide pleated kb_black_sea or kb_indigo trousers called kb_a `` kb_hakama '' ( used also in kb_naginatajutsu , kb_kendo , and kb_iaido ) . in many schools , its use is reserved for practitioners with ( `` kb_dan_(rank) '' ) ranks or for instructors , while others allow all practitioners to wear kb_a `` kb_hakama '' regardless of rank .the most common criticism of aikido is that kb_it suffers from kb_a lack of kb_metaphysical_realism in kb_military_education_and_training . the attacks initiated by `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' ( and which `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' must defend against ) have been criticized as kb_being `` weak '' , `` sloppy '' , and `` little more than caricatures of an attack '' .weak attacks from `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' allow for kb_a conditioned response from `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners . to counteract this , some kb_art_movement allow students to become less compliant over kb_time_(magazine) but , in keeping with the core philosophies , this is after having demonstrated

they are not kb_military_education_and_training for self-defense or kb_combat_(newspaper) effectiveness , but kb_spirituality , kb_fitness_(biology) or kb_other_(philosophy) reasons .another criticism pertains to the kb_shift_code in kb_military_education_and_training focus after the end of ueshiba 's seclusion in iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s , as kb_he_(letter) increasingly emphasized the kb_spirituality and kb_philosophy aspects of aikido . as kb_a result , strikes to kb_pressure_point points by `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , entering ( `` kb_irimi '' ) and initiation of techniques by `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , the distinction between `` omote '' ( front side ) and `` ura '' ( back side ) techniques , and the use of weapons , were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice . some aikido practitioners kb_sentience that lack of kb_military_education_and_training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness .conversely , some kb_art_movement of aikido receive criticism for not placing enough importance on the kb_spirituality practices emphasized by ueshiba . according to minoru shibata of aikido kb_academic_journal , `` o-sensei 's aikido was not kb_a continuation and kb_extension_(kinesiology) of the kb_old_testament and has kb_a distinct discontinuity with kb_past martial and kb_philosophy concepts .

'' kb_australian_english kb_lexical_semantics kb_derived_trait from this kb_meaning_(linguistics) include `` artifact '' , `` artificial '' , `` artifice '' , `` kb_medical_abortion kb_arts '' , and `` kb_military kb_arts '' . however , there are many kb_other_(philosophy) colloquial uses of kb_the_word_(free_love) word , all with some relation to its kb_etymologyover kb_time_(magazine) , kb_philosopher like kb_plato , kb_aristotle , kb_socrates and kb_immanuel_kant , among others , questioned the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of kb_art . several dialogues in kb_plato tackle questions about kb_art : kb_socrates says that kb_poetry is inspired by the kb_muses , and is not kb_rational_number . kb_he_(letter) speaks approvingly of this , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_theory_of_forms of kb_divinity madness ( drunkenness , eroticism , and dreaming ) in the `` kb_phaedrus_(plato) `` ( 265a–c ) , and yet in the `` '' kb_republic '' '' wants to kb_outlaw kb_homer 's great kb_poetic_edda kb_art , and laughter as kb_water_well . in `` kb_ion '' , kb_socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of kb_homer that kb_he_(letter) expresses in the `` kb_republic '' . the kb_dialogue `` kb_ion '' suggests that kb_homer 's `` kb_iliad '' functioned in the kb_ancient_greek kb_world_war_ii as the kb_bible does today in the kb_modern_history kb_christianity kb_world_war_ii : as divinely inspired literary kb_art that can provide kb_morality guidance , if only kb_it can kb_beryllium properly interpreted .with regards to the literary kb_art and the musical kb_arts , kb_aristotle considered kb_epic_poetry , tragedy , comedy , kb_dithyramb kb_poetry and kb_music to kb_beryllium kb_mimesis or imitative kb_art , each varying in imitation by kb_list_of_art_mediums , kb_space_debris , and manner . for example , kb_music imitates with the kb_medes of kb_rhythm and kb_harmony , whereas kb_dance imitates with kb_rhythm alone , and kb_poetry with kb_hunnic_language . the kb_theory_of_forms also differ in their kb_space_debris of imitation . comedy , for instance , is kb_a dramatic imitation of men worse than average ; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average . lastly , the kb_theory_of_forms differ in their manner of imitation—through kb_narrative or kb_character_(computing) , through change or no change , and through drama or no drama . kb_aristotle believed that imitation is kb_natural_number to mankind and constitutes kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of mankind 's advantages over kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing .the kb_second_language , and more recent , kb_word_sense of kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_art '' as an abbreviation for `` kb_creativity kb_art '' or `` kb_fine_art '' kb_declaration_of_independence_of_albania in the early 17th century . kb_fine_art refers to kb_a skill used to express the kb_artist 's creativity , or to engage the audience 's kb_aesthetic sensibilities , or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or `` finer '' kb_cold_working of kb_art .within this latter kb_word_sense , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_art '' may refer to several things : ( kb_iodine ) kb_a kb_science of kb_a kb_creativity skill , ( ii ) kb_a process of using the kb_creativity skill , ( iii ) kb_a kb_decay_product of the kb_creativity skill , or ( iv ) the audience 's experience with the kb_creativity skill . the kb_creativity kb_arts ( `` kb_art '' as discipline ) are kb_a kb_class_(set_theory) of disciplines which produce `` kb_artworks '' ( `` kb_art '' as kb_object_relations_theory ) that are compelled by kb_a kb_personal_property drive ( kb_art as activity ) and convey kb_a message , mood , or kb_symbolism_(arts) for the perceiver to interpret ( kb_art as experience ) . kb_art is something that stimulates an kb_individual 's thoughts , emotions , kb_orthodoxy , or kb_idea through the senses . works of kb_art can kb_beryllium explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of images or kb_object_relations_theory . for some scholars , such as kb_immanuel_kant , the kb_sciences and kb_the_arts kb_arts could kb_beryllium distinguished by taking kb_science as representing the domain of kb_knowledge_representation and kb_the_arts kb_arts as representing the domain of the kb_freedom of artistic expression .often , if the skill is kb_being used in kb_a common or practical way , kb_people_(american_magazine) kb_will_and_testament consider kb_it kb_a kb_craft instead of kb_art . likewise , if the skill is kb_being used in kb_a commercial or industrial way , kb_it may kb_beryllium considered kb_commercial_art kb_art instead of kb_fine_art . on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , crafts and design are sometimes considered kb_applied_art . some kb_art followers have argued that the difference between kb_fine_art and kb_applied_art has more to do with kb_lightness judgments made about the kb_art than any clear definitional difference . however , even kb_fine_art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression . the purpose of works of kb_art may kb_beryllium to communicate kb_idea , such as in kb_politics_of_albania , spiritually , or philosophically motivated kb_art ; to create kb_a kb_word_sense of kb_beauty ( kb_episcopal_see kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics ) ; to explore the kb_nature of kb_machine_perception ; for kb_pleasure ; or to generate kb_strong_nuclear_force emotions . the purpose may also kb_beryllium seemingly nonexistent .the kb_nature of kb_art has been described by kb_philosophy kb_richard_wollheim wollheim as `` kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the most elusive of the traditional kb_problems_(aristotle) of kb_human kb_albanian_culture '' . kb_art has been kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as kb_a kb_space_vehicle for the expression or kb_communication of emotions and kb_idea , kb_a means for kb_exploring and appreciating kb_formalism_(art) kb_chemical_element for their own sake , and as `` kb_mimesis '' or kb_representation_(arts) . kb_art as kb_mimesis has deep kb_semitic_root in the kb_philosophy of kb_aristotle . kb_leo_tolstoy tolstoy kb_interpretatio_graeca kb_art as kb_a use of indirect means to communicate from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_person to another . kb_benedetto_croce croce and r.g . collingwood advanced the kb_idealism view that kb_art expresses emotions , and that the kb_cold_working of kb_art therefore essentially exists in the kb_mind of the creator . the kb_theory of kb_art as kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism has its kb_semitic_root in the kb_philosophy of kb_immanuel_kant , and was kb_adaptation in the early twentieth century by kb_roger_fry fry and kb_clive_bell kb_bell . more recently , thinkers influenced by kb_martin_heidegger heidegger have interpreted kb_art as the means by which kb_a kb_community develops for itself kb_a kb_list_of_art_mediums for self-expression and kb_interpretation_(logic) . kb_george_dickie_(philosopher) has offered an kb_institutional_theory_of_art kb_theory of kb_art that defines kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art as any artifact upon which kb_a qualified kb_grammatical_person or persons acting on behalf of the kb_social_anarchism institution commonly referred to as `` the kb_art_world '' has conferred `` the status of candidate for appreciation '' . larry shiner has described kb_fine_art as `` not an kb_essence or kb_a fate but something we have made . kb_art as we have generally understood kb_it is kb_a kb_european_eel invention barely kb_2_(number) hundred years kb_old_testament .

about 75,000 years old—were discovered in kb_a kb_southern_africa kb_african_plate cave . containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100,000 years . etched

civilizations , more of their kb_art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to kb_other_(philosophy) cultures and later times . some also have provided the kb_first_trimester kb_record_(computer_science) of how artists worked . for example , this period of kb_ancient_greek kb_art saw kb_a veneration of the kb_human kb_health kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism and the development of kb_cognate skills to show musculature , poise , kb_beauty , and anatomically correct proportions .in kb_byzantine_empire and kb_medieval_greek kb_art of the kb_western_esotericism kb_middle_ages ages , much kb_art focused on the expression of kb_british_subject about kb_biblical and kb_religion kb_albanian_culture , and

kb_microsoft_windows , which also presented figures in idealized , patterned ( flat ) kb_theory_of_forms . nevertheless , kb_a kb_classical_conditioning kb_mathematical_realism kb_tradition persisted in small kb_byzantine_empire works , and kb_metaphysical_realism steadily grew in the kb_art of kb_catholic_europe .kb_renaissance kb_art had kb_a greatly increased kb_emphasis_(typography) on the

kb_woodblock_printing printingthe kb_western_esotericism kb_age_of_enlightenment of kb_age_of_enlightenment in the kb_18th_century century saw artistic depictions of kb_health and kb_rational_number

kb_renaissance draftsmanship ) had an immense influence on kb_impressionism and subsequent development . later , kb_african_art were taken up by picasso and to some extent by kb_matisse . similarly ,

kb_post-modernism exerting kb_a powerful influence .kb_modernism , the idealistic search for kb_truth , gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to kb_a realization of its unattainability . kb_theodor_w._adorno w. adorno said in 1970 , `` kb_it is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns kb_art can kb_beryllium taken for granted any more : neither kb_art itself , nor kb_art in

furthermore , the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue kb_it is now more appropriate to think in terms of kb_a kb_globalization kb_albanian_culture , rather than of kb_regional_power ones .in `` kb_the_origin_of_the_work_of_art kb_evolution of the kb_cold_working of kb_art '' , kb_martin_heidegger heideggerthe kb_creativity kb_arts are often divided into more specific categories , typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as kb_medes , kb_genre , kb_art_movement , and kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . kb_art kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism refers to the kb_elements_of_art kb_art that are independent of its kb_interpretation_(logic) or kb_importance . kb_it kb_cover_version the methods kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by the kb_artist and the kb_health kb_function_composition of the artwork , primarily non-semantic aspects of the kb_cold_working ( i.e. , kb_figurae ) , such as kb_color , kb_contour_drawing , kb_dimension , kb_list_of_art_mediums , kb_melody , kb_space , kb_texture_(painting) , and kb_lightness . kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism may also include kb_visual_design_elements_and_principles#principles_of_design design principles , such as arrangement , kb_formal_balance , kb_contrast_(vision) , kb_emphasis_(typography) , kb_harmony , kb_hierarchical_proportion , kb_principles_of_grouping , and kb_rhythm .in kb_general_(united_states) there are kb_triliteral schools of kb_philosophy regarding kb_art , focusing respectively on kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , content , and kb_context_(language_use) . extreme kb_formalism_(art) is the view that all kb_aesthetic kb_chemical_property of kb_art are formal ( that is , part of the kb_art kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism ) . kb_philosopher almost kb_universal_reconciliation reject this view and hold that the kb_chemical_property and kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics of kb_art extend beyond materials , techniques , and kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . unfortunately , there is little consensus on terminology for these informal kb_chemical_property . some authors refer to kb_grammatical_subject kb_matter and content – i.e. , denotations and connotations – while others prefer terms like kb_meaning_(linguistics) and kb_importance .extreme intentionalism holds that kb_authorial_intent intent kb_play_(theatre) kb_a decisive role in the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art , conveying the content or kb_essential_element main idea , while all kb_other_(philosophy) interpretations can kb_beryllium discarded . kb_it defines the kb_grammatical_subject as the persons or idea represented , and the content as the kb_artist 's experience of that kb_grammatical_subject . for example , the kb_function_composition of kb_napoleon_i_on_his_imperial_throne on kb_histidine kb_ottoman_empire throne is partly kb_loanword from the kb_statue_of_zeus_at_olympia kb_zeus at kb_olympia_(manet) . as evidenced by the kb_title , the kb_grammatical_subject is kb_napoleon , and the content is kb_jean-auguste-dominique_ingres 's kb_representation_(arts) of kb_napoleon as `` emperor-god beyond kb_time_(magazine) and kb_space '' . similarly to extreme kb_formalism_(art) , kb_philosopher typically reject extreme intentionalism , because kb_art may have kb_cross-platform_software ambiguous meanings and kb_authorial_intent intent may kb_beryllium kb_uncertainty and thus irrelevant . its restrictive kb_interpretation_(logic) is `` socially unhealthy , philosophically unreal , and kb_politics_of_albania unwise '' .finally , the developing kb_theory of kb_post-structuralism studies kb_art 's kb_importance in kb_a kb_cultural_anthropology kb_context_(language_use) , such as the kb_idea , emotions , and reactions prompted by kb_a kb_cold_working . the kb_cultural_anthropology kb_context_(language_use) often kb_redox to the kb_artist 's techniques and intentions , in which case kb_analysis proceeds along lines similar to kb_formalism_(art) and intentionalism . however , in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_noun_case historical and kb_material conditions may predominate , such as kb_religion and kb_philosophy convictions , sociopolitical and kb_economic_anthropology kb_structural_analysis , or even kb_climate_of_albania and kb_geography . kb_art_criticismkb_art can connote kb_a kb_word_sense of trained ability or mastery of kb_a kb_list_of_art_mediums . kb_art can also simply refer to the kb_adaptation and efficient use of kb_a kb_hunnic_language `` kb_art '' , kb_particular in its elevated kb_word_sense , requires kb_a certain level of kb_creativity expertise by the kb_artist , whether this kb_beryllium kb_a demonstration of technical ability , an originality in stylistic approach , or kb_a combination of these kb_2_(number) . traditionally skill of execution was viewed as kb_a quality inseparable from kb_art and thus necessary for its success ; for kb_leonardo_da_vinci da vinci , kb_art , neither more nor less than kb_histidine kb_other_(philosophy) endeavors , was kb_a manifestation of skill . kb_rembrandt 's kb_cold_working , now praised for its ephemeral virtues , was most admired by kb_histidine contemporaries for its virtuosity . at the kb_turn_(geometry) of the 20th century , the adroit performances of kb_john_singer_sargent sargent were alternately admired and viewed with kb_skepticism for their kb_manual_(music) kb_fluency , yet at nearly the same kb_time_(magazine) the kb_artist kb_world_health_organization would become the era 's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast , kb_pablo_picasso picassokb_a common contemporary criticism of some kb_modern_art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic kb_space_debris . in kb_conceptual_art , kb_marcel_duchamp kb_duchamp 's `` kb_fountain_(duchamp) '' is among the kb_first_trimester examples of pieces wherein the kb_artist used kb_found_art kb_object_relations_theory ( `` ready-made '' ) and exercised no traditionally recognised kb_set_(mythology) of skills . kb_tracey_emin kb_tracey_emin 's `` my bed '' , or kb_damien_hirst kb_damien_hirstsince kb_history_of_abortion , much of the finest kb_art has represented kb_a deliberate kb_computer_monitor of wealth or kb_power_(physics) , often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials . much kb_art has been commissioned by kb_politics rulers or kb_religion establishments , with more modest versions only kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance to the most wealthy in society .nevertheless , there have been many periods where kb_art of very kb_high_middle_ages quality was kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance , in terms of kb_ownership , across kb_prespa_lake parts of society , above all in cheap kb_medes such as kb_ancient_egyptian_pottery , which persists in the ground , and perishable kb_medes such as kb_textile_industry and kb_wood . in many different cultures , the kb_ceramics_of_indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas of kb_indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas of the kb_americas are found in such kb_a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to kb_a kb_social_elite , though kb_other_(philosophy) kb_theory_of_forms of kb_art may have been . reproductive methods such as kb_molding_(process) made mass-production easier , and were used to bring high-quality kb_ancient_roman_pottery kb_ancient_egyptian_pottery and kb_ancient_greek tanagra figurines to kb_a very wide market . kb_cylinder_seals were both artistic and practical , and very widely used by what can kb_beryllium loosely called the middle kb_class_(biology) in the kb_ancient_near_east kb_east_africa . once kb_ancient_roman_coinage were widely used , these also became an kb_art kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism that reached the widest range of society .another important kb_list_of_azerbaijani_inventions_and_discoveries came in the 15th century in kb_europe , when kb_printmaking began with small woodcuts , mostly kb_religion , that were often very small and hand-colored , and affordable even by peasants kb_world_health_organization glued them to the walls of their homes . printed books were initially very expensive , but fell steadily in kb_price until by the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations . kb_popular_prints prints of many different

kb_general_(united_states) kb_state_school , rather than the areas seen only by the kb_priests . many areas of royal palaces , castles and the houses of the kb_social_elite were often generally

kb_paris , which could kb_beryllium visited for most of the kb_18th_century century . in kb_italy the kb_art kb_tourism_in_angola of the kb_grand_tour tour became kb_a kb_major_(united_states) kb_industry from the kb_renaissance onwards , and governments and cities made efforts to make their kb_key_(cryptography) works accessible . the kb_kingdom_of_great_britain kb_royal_collection

of reasons , including kb_religion ones . kb_aniconism is kb_a kb_general_(united_states) dislike of either all figurative images , or often just kb_religion ones , and has been kb_a thread in many

have often been kb_conservative and taken very seriously by kb_art kb_art_critic , though often much less kb_sulfate by kb_a wider kb_state_school . the kb_iconography content of kb_art could cause

kb_crucifixion_of_jesus of kb_jesus . the `` last kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition '' by kb_michelangelo was controversial for various reasons , including breaches of kb_decorum through nudity and the apollo-like pose of kb_jesus_christ .the content of much formal kb_art through kb_history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the kb_artist , but with the kb_advent of kb_romanticism , and kb_economic_anthropology changes in the production of kb_art , the artists ' kb_computer_vision became the usual kb_determinant of the content of kb_histidine kb_art , increasing the incidence of kb_controversies_in_autism , though often kb_redox their kb_importance . kb_strong_nuclear_force incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to kb_court kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war . kb_théodore_géricault géricault 's `` kb_the_raft_of_the_medusa of the kb_medusa '' ( kb_circa 1820 ) , was in part kb_a kb_politics

to and fro over the kb_century_(cricket) . this concern is largely absent in kb_other_(philosophy) traditions of kb_art . the kb_aesthetic theorist kb_john_ruskin , kb_world_health_organization championed what kb_he_(letter) saw as the kb_realism_(arts) of j. m. w. kb_j._m._w._turner , saw kb_art 's role as the kb_communication by artifice of an kb_essential_element kb_truth that could only kb_beryllium found in kb_nature .the kb_definition and evaluation of kb_art has become especially problematic since the 20th century . kb_richard_wollheim wollheim distinguishes kb_triliteral approaches to assessing the kb_aesthetic kb_lightness of kb_art : the kb_mathematical_realism , whereby kb_aesthetic quality is an kb_absolute_value independent of any kb_human view ; the kb_objectivity_(philosophy) , whereby kb_it is also an kb_absolute_value , but is dependent on kb_general_(united_states) kb_human experience ; and the kb_relativist kb_positional_notationthe kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_modernism in the late nineteenth century kb_lead to kb_a kb_political_radicalism break in the kb_human_fertilization of the kb_function_(biology) of kb_art , and then again in the late twentieth century with the kb_advent of kb_postmodern_art . kb_clement_greenberg greenberg 's kb_u.s._presidential_election,_1960 article `` modernist kb_painting '' defines kb_modern_art as `` the use of kb_characteristic_(algebra) methods of kb_a discipline to criticize the discipline itself '' . greenberg originally kb_applied_science this idea to the abstract kb_german_expressionism kb_movement_(sign_language) and used kb_it as kb_a way to kb_natural_language_understanding and justify flat ( non-illusionistic ) abstract kb_painting :pop artists like kb_andy_warhol warhol became both noteworthy and influential through kb_cold_working including and possibly critiquing popular kb_albanian_culture , as kb_water_well as the kb_art_world . artists of the 1980s , 1990s , and kb_2000s_in_angola expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond `` kb_high_middle_ages kb_art '' to all kb_cultural_anthropology image-making , including fashion images , comics , billboards and pornography .kb_duchamp once kb_anatolian_hypothesis that kb_art is any activity of any kind- everything . however , the way that only certain activities are classified today as kb_art is kb_a kb_social_anarchism kb_construction . there is kb_evidence_(law) that there may kb_beryllium an kb_chemical_element of kb_truth to this . `` the invention of kb_art : kb_a kb_cultural_anthropology kb_history '' is an kb_art_history book which examines the kb_construction of the kb_modern_history system of kb_the_arts kb_arts i.e . kb_fine_art . shiner finds kb_evidence_(law) that the older system of kb_the_arts kb_arts before our kb_modern_history system ( kb_fine_art ) held kb_art to kb_beryllium any skilled kb_human activity i.e . kb_ancient_greek society did not possess the kb_terminology kb_art but kb_techne . kb_techne can kb_beryllium understood neither as kb_art or kb_craft , the kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving kb_being that the kb_aspect_ratio_(image)#distinctions of kb_art and kb_craft are historical products that came later on in kb_human kb_history . kb_techne included kb_painting , sculpting and kb_music but also ; cooking , kb_medicine , kb_horsemanship , kb_geometry , kb_carpentry , kb_prophecy , and farming etc .following kb_duchamp during the kb_first_trimester half of the twentieth century , kb_a significant kb_shift_code to kb_general_(united_states) kb_aesthetic kb_theory took kb_place_of_articulation which attempted to apply kb_aesthetic kb_theory between various kb_theory_of_forms of kb_art , including the literary kb_arts and the kb_visual_arts kb_arts , to each kb_other_(philosophy) . this resulted in the rise of kb_the_new_criticism kb_new_criticism kb_school and kb_abortion_debate concerning `` kb_intentional_fallacy intentional fallacy '' . at issue was the kb_question of whether the kb_aesthetic intentions of the kb_artist in creating the kb_cold_working of kb_art , whatever its specific kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , should kb_beryllium associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final kb_decay_product of the kb_cold_working of kb_art , or , if the kb_cold_working of kb_art should kb_beryllium evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the kb_artist .in 1946 , kb_w._k._wimsatt k. wimsatt and kb_monroe_beardsley beardsley published kb_a classic and controversial kb_new_world critical essay entitled `` kb_intentional_fallacy intentional fallacy '' , in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author 's intention , or `` kb_intention kb_meaning_(linguistics) '' in the kb_analysis of kb_a literary kb_cold_working . for wimsatt and beardsley , the kb_lexical_semantics on the page were all that mattered ; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant , and potentially distracting .in another essay , `` kb_affective_fallacy affective fallacy , '' which served as kb_a kind of sister essay to `` kb_intentional_fallacy intentional fallacy '' wimsatt and beardsley also discounted the kb_reader_(academic_rank) 's personal/emotional reaction to kb_a literary kb_cold_working as kb_a valid means of analyzing kb_a text . this fallacy would later kb_beryllium repudiated by theorists from the kb_reader-response kb_school of literary kb_theory . ironically , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the leading theorists from this kb_school , kb_stanley_fish kb_fish , was himself trained by kb_new_world kb_art_critic . kb_fish criticizes wimsatt and beardsley in kb_histidine essay `` kb_ancient_egyptian_literature in the kb_reader_(academic_rank) '' ( 1970 ) .as summarized by gaut and livingston in their essay `` the creation of kb_art '' : `` kb_structuralism and post-structuralists theorists and kb_art_critic were sharply critical of many aspects of kb_new_criticism , beginning with the kb_emphasis_(typography) on kb_aesthetic appreciation and the so-called kb_self-governance of kb_art , but they reiterated the attack on kb_biographical_film criticisms 's assumption that the kb_artist 's activities and experience were kb_a privileged critical kb_topic_(linguistics) . '' these authors contend that : `` anti-intentionalists , such as formalists , hold that the intentions involved in the making of kb_art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting kb_art . kb_sulfate details of the act of creating kb_a kb_cold_working , though possibly of kb_interest in themselves , have no bearing on the correct kb_interpretation_(logic) of the kb_cold_working . ''gaut and livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that : `` intentionalists , unlike formalists , hold that reference to intentions is kb_essential_element in fixing the correct kb_interpretation_(logic) of works . '' they quote kb_richard_wollheim wollheim as stating that , `` the task of criticism is the kb_reconstruction_era of the kb_creativity process , where the kb_creativity process must in kb_turn_(geometry) kb_beryllium thought of as something not stopping short of , but terminating on , the kb_cold_working of kb_art itself . ''the end of the 20th century fostered an extensive kb_abortion_debate known as the kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_turn_(geometry) kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war , or the `` innocent kb_human_eye kb_abortion_debate '' , and generally referred to as the structuralism-poststructuralism kb_abortion_debate in the kb_philosophy of kb_art . this kb_abortion_debate discussed the encounter of the kb_cold_working of kb_art as kb_being determined by the relative extent to which the kb_concept encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art .decisive for the kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_turn_(geometry) kb_abortion_debate in kb_art_history and the kb_humanities were the works of yet another kb_tradition , namely the kb_structuralism of kb_ferdinand_de_saussure kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann saussure and the ensuing kb_movement_(sign_language) of kb_poststructuralism . in 1981 , the kb_artist kb_mark_tansey created kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art titled `` the innocent kb_human_eye '' as kb_a criticism of the prevailing kb_climate_of_albania of disagreement in the kb_philosophy of kb_art during the closing decades of the 20th century . influential theorists include kb_judith_butler butler , kb_luce_irigaray irigaray , kb_julia_kristeva , kb_michel_foucault kb_léon_foucault and kb_jacques_derrida derrida . the kb_power_(physics) of kb_hunnic_language , more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes , in kb_art_history and historical kb_discourse was explored by kb_hayden_white kb_white_american . the kb_fact that kb_hunnic_language is `` not '' kb_a transparent kb_list_of_art_mediums of thought had been stressed by kb_a very different kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_philosophy_of_language kb_hunnic_language which originated in the works of kb_johann_georg_hamann georg hamann and kb_wilhelm_von_humboldt von humboldt . kb_ernst_gombrich gombrich and kb_nelson_goodman goodman in kb_histidine book `` languages of kb_art : an approach to kb_a kb_theory of kb_symbols '' came to hold that the kb_concept encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art during the kb_1960s_in_the_united_states and 1970s . kb_he_(letter) was challenged on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of kb_research done by the kb_nobel_prize prize winning psychologist kb_roger_sperry sperry kb_world_health_organization maintained that the kb_human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in kb_hunnic_language alone ( the kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_turn_(geometry) ) and that kb_other_(philosophy) kb_theory_of_forms of kb_psychology representations of the kb_cold_working of kb_art were equally defensible and demonstrable . sperry 's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with kb_aesthetic kb_philosopher such as kb_nick_zangwill zangwill disputes as to whether or not to classify something as kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art are referred to as classificatory disputes about kb_art . classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included kb_cubism and kb_impressionist paintings , kb_duchamp 's `` kb_fountain_(duchamp) '' , the movies , superlative imitations of kb_j._s._g._boggs , kb_conceptual_art , and kb_video_games . kb_philosophy kb_jacques-louis_david novitz has argued that disagreement about the kb_definition of kb_art are rarely the kb_heart of the problem . rather , `` the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their kb_social_anarchism kb_life_(magazine) '' are `` kb_sulfate much kb_a part of all classificatory disputes about kb_art '' ( novitz , 1996 ) . according to novitz , classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to kb_go_(game) than they are about kb_theory proper . for example , when the `` kb_daily_mail kb_airmail '' criticized kb_damien_hirst 's and kb_tracey_emin 's kb_cold_working by arguing `` for 1,000 years kb_art has been kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of our great civilising kb_afsharid_dynasty . today , pickled kb_sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) all '' they are not advancing kb_a kb_definition or kb_theory about kb_art , but questioning the kb_lightness of kb_damien_hirst 's and kb_tracey_emin 's kb_cold_working . in kb_1998_nrl_season , kb_arthur_danto , suggested kb_a kb_einstein's_thought_experiments kb_experiment showing that `` the status of an artifact as kb_cold_working of kb_art results from the kb_idea kb_a kb_albanian_culture applies to kb_it , rather than its inherent kb_health or perceptible qualities . kb_cultural_anthropology kb_interpretation_(logic) ( an kb_art kb_theory of some kind ) is therefore constitutive of an kb_space_debris 's arthood . ''kb_anti-art is kb_a label for kb_art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of kb_art ; kb_it is kb_terminology associated with kb_dadaism and attributed to kb_marcel_duchamp kb_duchamp just before kb_world_war_ii kb_war kb_iodine , when kb_he_(letter) was making kb_art from kb_found_art kb_object_relations_theory . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of these , `` kb_fountain_(duchamp) '' ( 1917 ) , an kb_ordinary_(officer) urinal , has achieved considerable kb_topographic_prominence and influence on kb_art . kb_anti-art is kb_a kb_i_shot_andy_warhol of kb_cold_working by kb_situationist_international international , the lo-fi kb_airmail kb_art_movement , and the kb_young_british_artists artists , though kb_it is kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism still rejected by the kb_stuckism , kb_world_health_organization describe themselves as kb_anti-anti-art .kb_architecture is often included as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_visual_arts kb_arts ; however , like the kb_decorative_artssomewhat in relation to the above , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_art '' is also used to apply judgments of kb_lightness , as in such expressions as `` that meal was kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art '' ( the cook is an kb_artist ) , or `` the kb_art of deception '' , ( the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised ) . kb_it is this use of kb_the_word_(free_love) word as kb_a kb_measure_(mathematics) of kb_high_middle_ages quality and kb_high_middle_ages kb_lightness that gives the kb_terminology its kb_flavor of subjectivity . making judgments of kb_lightness requires kb_a kb_basis_(linear_algebra) for criticism . at the simplest level , kb_a way to determine whether the impact of the kb_space_debris on the senses meets the criteria to kb_beryllium considered `` kb_art '' is whether kb_it is perceived to kb_beryllium attractive or repulsive . though kb_machine_perception is always colored by experience , and is necessarily subjective , kb_it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying can not kb_beryllium kb_art . however , `` good '' kb_art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to kb_a majority of viewers . in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_lexical_semantics , an kb_artist 's kb_prime_(symbol) kb_motivation need not kb_beryllium the pursuit of the kb_aesthetic . also , kb_art often depicts terrible images made for kb_social_anarchism , kb_morality , or thought-provoking reasons . for example , kb_francisco_goya goya 's kb_painting depicting the kb_spanish_empire shootings of 3rd of may 1808 is kb_a graphic depiction of kb_a firing squad executing several kb_pleading kb_civilian_casualties . yet at the same kb_time_(magazine) , the horrific kb_imagery demonstrates goya 's keen artistic ability in kb_function_composition and execution and produces fitting kb_social_anarchism and kb_politics outrage . thus , the kb_abortion_debate continues as to what kb_musical_mode of kb_aesthetic satisfaction , if any , is required to define 'art ' .the assumption of kb_new_world values or the rebellion against kb_acceptance#self_acceptance notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with kb_a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing . indeed , the kb_obverse_and_reverse is often kb_truth , that the revision of what is kb_folk_etymology conceived of as kb_being aesthetically appealing allows for kb_a re-invigoration of kb_aesthetic sensibility , and kb_a kb_new_world appreciation for the kb_corporate_social_responsibility of kb_art itself . countless schools have kb_anatolian_hypothesis their own ways to define quality , yet they all seem to agree in at least kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) point : once their kb_aesthetic choices are kb_acceptance#self_acceptance , the kb_lightness of the kb_cold_working of kb_art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen kb_list_of_art_mediums to kb_strike_action some kb_universal_studios chord by the rarity of the skill of the kb_artist or in its accurate kb_reflection_(physics) in what is termed the `` kb_zeitgeist '' . kb_art is often kb_intention to kb_appeal to and connect with kb_human kb_emotion . kb_it can arouse kb_aesthetic or kb_morality feelings , and can kb_beryllium understood as kb_a way of communicating these feelings . artists express something kb_sulfate that their audience is aroused to some extent

of kb_abortion with the availability of kb_prostaglandin kb_prostaglandin_analogue in the 1970s and the kb_antiprogestin kb_mifepristone ( also known as ru-486 ) in the 1980s .the most common early first-trimester kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion regimens use kb_mifepristone in combination with kb_a kb_prostaglandin kb_analog_device ( kb_misoprostol or kb_gemeprost ) up to 9 weeks kb_gestational_age age , kb_methotrexate in combination with kb_a kb_prostaglandin kb_analog_device up to 7 weeks kb_gestation , or kb_a kb_prostaglandin kb_analog_device alone . mifepristone–misoprostol combination regimens kb_cold_working faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexate–misoprostol combination regimens , and combination regimens are more effective than kb_misoprostol alone . this regime is effective in the kb_second_trimester . kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion regiments involving kb_mifepristone followed by kb_misoprostol in the

are 98 % effective up to 9 weeks kb_gestational_age age . if kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion fails , surgical kb_abortion must kb_beryllium used to complete the procedure .early kb_medical_abortion abortions account for the majority of abortions before 9 weeks kb_gestation in kb_great_britain , kb_france , kb_switzerland , and the kb_nordic_countries . in the united kb_sovereign_state , the percentage of early kb_medical_abortion abortions is around 30 % .kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion regimens using kb_mifepristone in combination with kb_a kb_prostaglandin kb_analog_device are the most

second-trimester abortions are performed surgically by kb_dilation_and_evacuation and evacuationup to 15 weeks ' kb_gestation , kb_suction-aspiration_abortion or kb_vacuum_aspiration are the most common surgical methods of kb_#induced kb_abortion . `` kb_manual_(music) kb_vacuum_aspiration '' ( mva ) consists of removing the kb_fetus or kb_embryo , kb_placenta , and membranes by suction using kb_a kb_manual_(music) syringe , while `` electric kb_vacuum_aspiration '' ( eva ) uses an electric pump . these techniques differ in the kb_mechanism_(biology) used to apply suction , in how early in kb_pregnancy they can kb_beryllium used , and in whether kb_cervical_dilation is necessary .mva , also known as `` mini-suction '' and `` kb_menstrual_extraction extraction '' , can kb_beryllium used in very early kb_pregnancy , and does not require kb_cervical_dilation . kb_dilation_and_curettage and kb_curettage ( d & kb_vitamin_c ) , the kb_second_language most common method of surgical kb_abortion , is kb_a standard gynecological procedure performed for kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of reasons , including kb_hypothesis of the uterine lining for possible malignancy , investigation of abnormal bleeding , and kb_abortion . kb_curettage refers to cleaning the walls of the kb_uterus with kb_a kb_curette . the kb_world_health_organization organization recommends this procedure , also called `` sharp kb_curettage , '' only when mva is unavailable .from the 15th kb_gestational_age of kb_gestation until approximately the 26th , kb_other_(philosophy) techniques must kb_beryllium used . kb_dilation_and_evacuation and evacuation ( d & e ) consists of opening the kb_cervix of the kb_uterus and emptying kb_it using surgical instruments and suction . after the 16th kb_gestational_age of kb_gestation , abortions can also kb_beryllium induced by kb_intact_dilation_and_extraction dilation and extraction ( idx ) ( also called intrauterine cranial decompression ) , which requires surgical decompression of the kb_fetus 's kb_human_head before evacuation . idx is sometimes called `` kb_partial-birth_abortion kb_abortion '' , which has been kb_partial-birth_abortion_ban_act banned in the united kb_sovereign_state .in the kb_ipad_(third_generation) kb_pregnancy#terminology of kb_pregnancy , kb_#induced kb_abortion may kb_beryllium performed surgically by kb_intact_dilation_and_extraction dilation and extraction or by kb_hysterotomy_abortion . kb_hysterotomy_abortion is kb_a procedure similar to kb_a kb_caesarean_section kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) and is performed under kb_general_anesthesia . kb_it requires kb_a smaller incision than kb_a kb_caesarean_section kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) and is used during later stages of kb_pregnancy .first-trimester procedures can generally kb_beryllium performed using kb_local_anesthesia anesthesia , while second-trimester methods may require kb_sedation#levels_of_sedation sedation or kb_general_anesthesia .in places lacking the necessary kb_medical_abortion skill for dilation and extraction , or where preferred by practitioners , an kb_abortion can kb_beryllium induced by kb_first_trimester kb_labor_induction kb_australian_labor_party and then kb_late_termination_of_pregnancy#methods fetal demise if necessary . this is sometimes called `` induced kb_miscarriage '' . this procedure may kb_beryllium performed from kb_boron_group weeks kb_gestation to the kb_ipad_(third_generation) kb_pregnancy#terminology . although kb_it is very uncommon in the united kb_sovereign_state , more than 80 % of induced abortions throughout the kb_second_trimester are labor-induced abortions in kb_sweden and kb_other_(philosophy) nearby countries .only limited kb_big_data are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance comparing this method with dilation and extraction . unlike d & e , labor-induced abortions after kb_18-point_agreement weeks may kb_beryllium complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival , which may kb_beryllium legally characterized as kb_viviparity birth . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , labor-induced kb_abortion is legally risky in the united kb_sovereign_state .kb_history , kb_a kb_grammatical_number of kb_herbaceous_plant reputed to possess kb_abortifacient kb_chemical_property have been used in kb_folk_medicine . among these are : kb_tansy , kb_mentha_pulegium , kb_black_cohosh , and the now-extinct kb_silphium .in 1978 kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) woman in kb_colorado died and another was seriously injured when they attempted to procure an kb_abortion by taking kb_mentha_pulegium kb_palm_oil .because the indiscriminant use of kb_herbaceous_plant as abortifacients can cause serious—even lethal—side effects , such as kb_multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome failure , such use is not recommended by physicians .kb_abortion is sometimes attempted by causing kb_physical_trauma to the kb_abdomen . the kb_degree_(angle) of kb_force , if severe , can cause serious internal kb_injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing kb_miscarriage . in

.reported methods of unsafe , kb_self-induced_abortion kb_abortion include misuse of kb_misoprostolthe health risks of kb_abortion depend principally upon whether the procedure is performed safely or unsafely . the kb_world_health_organization organization defines unsafe abortions as those performed by unskilled individuals , with kb_hazardous equipment , or in unsanitary facilities . kb_law abortions performed in the kb_developed_world are among the safest procedures in kb_medicine . in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , the kb_risk of kb_maternal_death kb_death from kb_abortion is 0.7 per 100,000 procedures , making kb_abortion about kb_boron_group times safer for women than childbirth ( 8.8 kb_maternal_deaths kb_maternal_death per 100,000 live births ) . in the united kb_sovereign_state from 2000 to kb_2009_in_science , kb_abortion had kb_a lower mortality rate than kb_plastic_surgery . the kb_risk of abortion-related mortality increases with kb_gestational_age age , but remains lower than that of childbirth through at least 21 weeks ' kb_gestation . outpatient kb_abortion is as safe and effective from 64 to 70 days ' kb_gestation as kb_it is from 57 to 63 days . kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion is safe and effective for pregnancies kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet than 6 weeks ' kb_gestation .kb_vacuum_aspiration in the kb_first_trimester is the safest method of surgical kb_abortion , and can kb_beryllium performed in kb_a kb_primary_care kb_office , kb_abortion_clinic , or hospital . complications , which are rare , can include kb_uterine_perforation perforation , kb_endometritis kb_infection , and retained products of kb_human_fertilization requiring kb_a kb_second_language procedure to evacuate . infections account for one-third of abortion-related kb_maternal_death in the united kb_sovereign_state . the rate of complications of kb_vacuum_aspiration kb_abortion in the kb_first_trimester is similar regardless of whether the procedure is performed in kb_a hospital , surgical center , or kb_office . preventive kb_antibiotics ( such as kb_doxycycline or kb_metronidazole ) are typically given before elective kb_abortion , as they are believed to substantially reduce the kb_risk of postoperative uterine kb_infection . the rate of failed procedures does not appear to vary significantly depending on whether the kb_abortion is performed by kb_a kb_physician or kb_a kb_mid-level_practitioner practitioner . complications after second-trimester kb_abortion are similar to those after first-trimester kb_abortion , and depend somewhat on the method chosen . second-trimester abortions are generally well-tolerated .there is little difference in terms of kb_air_safety and kb_efficacy between kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion using kb_a combined regimen of kb_mifepristone and kb_misoprostol and surgical kb_abortion ( kb_vacuum_aspiration ) in early kb_first_trimester abortions up to 9 weeks kb_gestation . kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion using the kb_prostaglandin kb_analog_device kb_misoprostol alone is less effective and more painful than kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion using kb_a combined regimen of kb_mifepristone and kb_misoprostol or surgical kb_abortion .some purported risks of kb_abortion are promoted primarily by anti-abortion kb_group_(mathematics) ,but lack kb_scientific_method support . for example , the kb_question of kb_a link between kb_abortion-breast_cancer_hypothesis and kb_breast_cancer has been investigated extensively . kb_major_(united_states) kb_medical_abortion and kb_scientific_method bodies ( including the kb_world_health_organization organization , kb_national_cancer_institute kb_cancer institute , kb_american_cancer_society society , kb_royal_college_of_obstetricians_and_gynaecologists kb_college of obgyn and kb_american_congress_of_obstetricians_and_gynecologists of obgyn ) have concluded that kb_abortion does not cause kb_breast_cancer .in the kb_past even illegality has not automatically meant that the abortions were unsafe . referring to the kb_united_states_navy , historian kb_linda_gordon kb_gordon,_scotland kb_sovereign_state : `` in kb_fact , illegal abortions in this kb_country_music have an impressive kb_air_safety record . '' according to kb_rickie_solinger solinger ,authors kb_jerome kb_billy_bates and edward zawadzki describe the case of an illegal abortionist in the kb_eastern_hemisphere kb_united_states_navy in the early 20th century kb_world_health_organization was proud of having successfully completed 13,844 abortions without any fatality .in 1870s kb_new_york_city the famous abortionist/midwife kb_madame_restell restell ( anna trow lohman ) appears to have kb_lost_film very few women among her more than 100,000 patients—a lower mortality rate than the childbirth mortality rate at the kb_time_(magazine) . in 1936 the prominent professor of obstetrics and gynecology kb_frederick_j._taussig j. taussig wrote that kb_a cause of increasing mortality during the years of illegality in the kb_united_states_navy was thatkb_electric_current kb_evidence_(law) finds no relationship between most induced abortions and kb_abortion_and_mental_health kb_problems_(aristotle) kb_other_(philosophy) than those expected for any unwanted kb_pregnancy . kb_a report by the kb_american_psychological_association kb_continental_association concluded that kb_a woman 's kb_first_trimester kb_abortion is not kb_a kb_threat to kb_mental_health when carried out in the kb_first_trimester , with such women no more likely to have kb_abortion_and_mental_health kb_problems_(aristotle) than those carrying an unwanted kb_pregnancy to kb_terminology ; the mental-health outcome of kb_a woman 's kb_second_language or greater kb_abortion is less certain . some older reviews concluded that kb_abortion was associated with an increased kb_risk of kb_psychology kb_problems_(aristotle) ; however , they did not use an appropriate control kb_group_(periodic_table) .although some studies show kb_negative_number mental-health outcomes in women kb_world_health_organization choose abortions after the kb_first_trimester because of fetal abnormalities , more rigorous kb_research would kb_beryllium needed to show this conclusively . some kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_negative_number kb_psychology effects of kb_abortion have been referred to by anti-abortion advocates as kb_a separate condition called `` kb_post-abortion_syndrome syndromewomen seeking an kb_abortion may use unsafe methods , especially when kb_abortion is legally restricted . they may attempt kb_self-induced_abortion kb_abortion or seek the help of kb_a kb_grammatical_person without proper kb_medical_abortion kb_military_education_and_training or facilities . this can kb_lead to severe complications , such as incomplete kb_abortion , kb_sepsis , hemorrhage , and damage to kb_organ_(anatomy) kb_organ_(anatomy) .unsafe abortions are kb_a kb_major_(united_states) cause of kb_injury and kb_death among women worldwide . although kb_big_data are imprecise , kb_it is estimated that approximately 20 million unsafe abortions are performed annually , with 97 % taking kb_place_of_articulation in developing countries . unsafe abortions are believed to result in millions of kb_injuries . estimates of kb_maternal_death vary according to kb_methodology , and have ranged from 37,000 to 70,000 in the kb_past decade ; kb_maternal_death from kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion account for around kb_boron_group % of all kb_maternal_deaths kb_maternal_death . the kb_world_health_organization organization believes that mortality has fallen since the 1990s . to reduce the kb_grammatical_number of unsafe abortions , kb_state_school health organizations have generally advocated emphasizing the kb_edict_of_toleration_by_galerius of kb_abortion , kb_military_education_and_training of kb_medical_abortion personnel , and ensuring access to reproductive-health kb_service_(economics) . in response , opponents of kb_abortion point out that kb_abortion bans in no way kb_affect_(psychology) prenatal care for women kb_world_health_organization choose to carry their kb_fetus to kb_terminology . the kb_dublin kb_united_states_declaration_of_independence on maternal health , signed in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2012 , notes , `` the kb_prohibition of kb_abortion does not kb_affect_(psychology) , in any way , the availability of optimal care to kb_pregnant women . ''kb_a kb_major_(united_states) kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors in whether abortions are performed safely or not is the kb_law standing of kb_abortion . countries with restrictive kb_abortion laws have higher kb_rates_(tax) of kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion and similar overall kb_abortion kb_rates_(tax) compared to those where kb_abortion is kb_law and kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance . for example , the 1996 kb_edict_of_toleration_by_galerius of kb_abortion in kb_south_africa had an immediate kb_positive_number impact on the kb_frequency of abortion-related complications , with abortion-related kb_maternal_death dropping by more than 90 % . similar reductions in kb_maternal_mortality mortality have been observed after kb_other_(philosophy) countries have liberalized their kb_abortion laws , such as kb_romania and kb_nepal . kb_a 2011 kb_science concluded that in the united kb_sovereign_state , some state-level anti-abortion laws are correlated with lower kb_rates_(tax) of kb_abortion in that kb_state_of_matter . the kb_analysis , however , did not kb_take into account kb_air_travel to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_sovereign_state without such laws to obtain an kb_abortion . in kb_addition , kb_a lack of access to effective kb_birth_control contributes to kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion . kb_it has been estimated that the incidence of kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion could kb_beryllium kb_redox by up to 75 % ( from 20 million to 5 million annually ) if kb_modern_history kb_family_planning and maternal health kb_service_(economics) were readily kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance globally . kb_rates_(tax) of such abortions may kb_beryllium difficult to kb_measure_(mathematics) because they can kb_beryllium reported variously as kb_miscarriage , `` induced kb_miscarriage '' , `` menstrual regulation '' , `` mini-abortion '' , and `` regulation of kb_a delayed/suspended menstruation '' .forty percent of the kb_world_war_ii 's women are able to access therapeutic and elective abortions within gestational limits , while an additional kb_35_arietis percent have access to kb_law kb_abortion if they meet certain kb_health , kb_mental_health , or socioeconomic criteria . while kb_maternal_mortality mortality seldom results from safe abortions , unsafe abortions result in 70,000 kb_maternal_death and 5 million disabilities per year . complications of kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion account for approximately an eighth of kb_maternal_death mortalities worldwide , though this varies by kb_region . kb_secondary_school infertility caused by an kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion kb_affect_(psychology) an estimated 24 million women . the rate of unsafe abortions has increased from 44 % to 49 % between kb_1995_davis_cup and 2008. health kb_education_in_albania , access to kb_family_planning , and improvements in health care during and after kb_abortion have been kb_anatolian_hypothesis to address this phenomenon .although kb_it is very uncommon , women undergoing surgical kb_abortion after kb_18-point_agreement weeks kb_gestation sometimes give birth to kb_a kb_fetus that may survive briefly . kb_fetal_viability kb_terminology survival is possible after 22 weeks .if kb_medical_abortion kb_stick_fighting observe signs of kb_life_(magazine) , they may kb_beryllium required to provide care : emergency kb_medical_care if the child has kb_a good chance of survival and palliative care if not . kb_feticide#use_during_legal_abortion fetal demise ; kb_big_data are kb_interpretatio_graeca as either kb_fetus or newborn . between kb_1999_australian_open and kb_2013_mediterranean_games , in the kb_united_states_navy , the kb_centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention recorded 531 such kb_maternal_death for newborns , approximately 4 per 100,000 abortions .there are kb_2_(number) commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of kb_abortion :in many places , where kb_abortion is illegal or carries kb_a heavy kb_social_stigma , kb_medical_abortion reporting of kb_abortion is not reliable . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , estimates of the incidence of kb_abortion must kb_beryllium made without determining certainty related to standard kb_error .the kb_grammatical_number of abortions performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in recent years , with 41.6 million having been performed in 2003 and 43.8 million having been performed in 2008. the kb_abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women , though kb_it was 24 per 1000 women for kb_developed_countries and 29 per 1000 women for developing countries . the same kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2012 kb_science indicated that in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 , the estimated kb_abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21 % worldwide , with 26 % in kb_developed_countries and 20 % in developing countries .on average , the incidence of kb_abortion is similar in countries with restrictive kb_abortion laws and those with more kb_liberal_christianity access to kb_abortion . however , restrictive kb_abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely . the kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion rate in developing countries is partly attributable to lack of access to kb_modern_history contraceptives ; according to the kb_guttmacher_institute institute , providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38,000 fewer kb_maternal_death from kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion annually worldwide .the rate of kb_law , kb_#induced kb_abortion varies extensively worldwide . according to the report of employees of kb_guttmacher_institute institute kb_it ranged from 7 per 1000 women ( kb_germany and kb_switzerland ) to 30 per 1000 women ( kb_estonia ) in countries with complete kb_statistics in 2008. the kb_hierarchical_proportion of pregnancies that ended in kb_#induced kb_abortion ranged from about 10 % ( kb_israel , kb_netherlands kb_netherlands and kb_switzerland ) to 30 % ( kb_estonia ) in the same kb_group_(periodic_table) , though kb_it might kb_beryllium as kb_high_middle_ages as 36 % kb_hungarian_revolution_of_1919 kb_hungary and kb_romania , whose kb_statistics were deemed incomplete .an kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) kb_science in kb_2002_australian_open concluded that about half of women having abortions were using kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_birth_control at the kb_time_(magazine) of becoming kb_pregnant . inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms and three-quarters of those using the kb_combined_oral_contraceptive_pill pill ; 42 % of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage . the kb_guttmacher_institute institute estimated that `` most abortions in the united kb_sovereign_state are obtained by minority women '' because minority women `` have much higher kb_rates_(tax) of kb_unintended_pregnancy kb_pregnancy '' .the kb_abortion rate may also kb_beryllium expressed as the average kb_grammatical_number of abortions kb_a woman has during her reproductive years ; this is referred to as `` total kb_abortion rate '' ( kb_tar ) .kb_abortion kb_rates_(tax) also vary depending on the stage of kb_pregnancy and the method practiced . in 2003 , the kb_centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention for kb_disease control and prevention ( kb_centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention ) reported that 26 % of reported kb_law induced abortions in the united kb_sovereign_state were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks ' kb_gestation , kb_18-point_agreement % at 7 weeks , 15 % at kb_group_8_element weeks , kb_18-point_agreement % at 9 through 10 weeks , 10 % at 11 through 12 weeks , 6 % at kb_boron_group through 15 weeks , 4 % at 16 through 20 weeks and 1 % at more than 21 weeks . 91 % of these were classified as having been done by `` kb_curettage '' ( kb_suction-aspiration_abortion , kb_dilation_and_curettage and kb_curettage , kb_dilation_and_evacuation and evacuation ) , kb_group_8_element % by `` kb_medical_abortion '' means ( kb_mifepristone ) , > 1 % by `` kb_instillation_abortion instillation '' ( kb_saline_(medicine) or kb_prostaglandin ) , and 1 % by `` kb_other_(philosophy) '' ( including kb_hysterotomy_abortion and kb_hysterectomy ) . according to the kb_centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention , due to kb_big_data kb_class_(set_theory) difficulties the kb_big_data must kb_beryllium viewed as tentative and some fetal kb_maternal_death reported beyond 20 weeks may kb_beryllium kb_natural_number kb_maternal_death erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead kb_fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an kb_#induced kb_abortion .the kb_guttmacher_institute institute estimated there were 2,200 kb_intact_dilation_and_extraction dilation and extractionthe reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the kb_world_war_ii .some of the most common reasons are to postpone childbearing to kb_a more suitable kb_time_(magazine) or to focus energies and resources on existing children . others include kb_being unable to afford kb_a child either in terms of the direct costs of raising kb_a child or the loss of kb_income while caring for the child , lack of support from the kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , inability to afford additional children , desire to provide schooling for existing children , disruption of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's own kb_education_in_albania , relationship kb_problems_(aristotle) with their partner , kb_a kb_machine_perception of kb_being too kb_thomas_young_(scientist) to have kb_a child , kb_unemployment , and not kb_being willing to raise kb_a child conceived as kb_a result of kb_rape or kb_incest , among others .some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures . these might include the preference for children of kb_a specific sex or kb_race_(human_categorization) , disapproval of kb_single_bond or early motherhood , stigmatization of kb_people_with_disabilities disabilities , insufficient kb_economic_anthropology support for kb_family_(biology) , lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods , or efforts toward kb_population_control ( such as kb_china 's kb_one-child_policy policy ) . these factors can sometimes result in kb_compulsory_education kb_abortion or kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion .an additional kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors is kb_risk to maternal or fetal health , which was cited as the kb_primary_education kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving for kb_abortion in over kb_a kb_ipad_(third_generation) of kb_noun_case in some countries and as kb_a significant kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors in only kb_a single-digit percentage of abortions in kb_other_(philosophy) countries .in the kb_united_states_navy , the supreme kb_court decisions in `` kb_roe_v._wade kb_verb wade '' and `` kb_doe_v._bolton kb_verb bolton '' : `` ruled that the kb_state_of_matter 's kb_interest in the kb_life_(magazine) of the kb_fetus became compelling only at the point of kb_fetal_viability , kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as the point at which the kb_fetus can survive independently of its mother . even after the point of kb_fetal_viability , the kb_state_of_matter can not favor the kb_life_(magazine) of the kb_fetus over the kb_life_(magazine) or health of the kb_pregnant woman . under the kb_right-wing_politics of privacy , physicians must kb_beryllium free to use their `` kb_medical_abortion kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition for the preservation of the kb_life_(magazine) or health of kb_the_mother_(1934_novel) mother .

woman 's kb_health or kb_mental_health well-being is kb_endangered_species , or socioeconomic considerations make childbirth kb_a hardship . in countries where kb_abortion is banned entirely , such as kb_abortion_in_nicaragua , kb_medical_abortion authorities have recorded kb_ice_rise in kb_maternal_death kb_death directly and indirectly due to kb_pregnancy as kb_water_well as kb_maternal_death due to kb_physician ' fears of prosecution if they treat kb_other_(philosophy) gynecological emergencies . some countries , such as kb_bangladesh , that nominally kb_ban_(unit) kb_abortion , may also

kb_social_stigma , kb_pregnant women may engage in kb_medical_tourism and kb_air_travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancies . women without the means to kb_air_travel can resort to

handful of small kb_patrol_craft kb_craft and barges .the kb_royal_navy has been neglected and ignored as kb_military_of_ancient_egypt kb_arm mainly due to the kb_guerrilla_warfare struggle against the kb_portuguese_language and the kb_nature of the kb_american_civil_war kb_war . from the early 1990s to the present the angolan kb_royal_navy has shrunk from around 4,200 personnel to around 1,000 , resulting in the loss of skills and expertise needed to maintain equipment . in kb_order_(biology) to protect kb_angola_(portugal) 's 1 600 km kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) coastline , the angolan kb_royal_navy is undergoing modernisation but is still lacking in many ways . kb_kingdom_of_portugal has been providing kb_military_education_and_training through its technical kb_military kb_cooperation ( ctm ) programme . the kb_royal_navy is requesting procurement of kb_a frigate , kb_triliteral corvettes , kb_triliteral offshore patrol vessel and additional fast patrol boats .most of the vessels in the kb_royal_navy 's kb_inventory dates back from the 1980s or kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet , and many of its ships are inoperable due to age and lack of maintenance . however the kb_royal_navy acquired kb_new_world boats from kb_spain and kb_france in the 1990s . kb_germany has delivered several kb_fast_attack_craft attack kb_craft for kb_border_crossings_of_albania protection in 2011 .in september 2014 kb_it was reported that the angolan kb_royal_navy would acquire seven macaé-class patrol vessels from kb_brazil as part of kb_a technical memorandum of understanding ( mou ) covering the production of the vessels as part of kb_angola_(portugal) 's naval kb_power_(physics) development programme ( pronaval ) . the kb_military of kb_angola_(portugal) aims to modernize its naval capability , presumably due to kb_a rise in maritime piracy within the gulf of kb_guinea which may have an kb_adverse_effect_(medicine) effect on the kb_country_music 's kb_economy_of_alaska .the kb_royal_navy 's kb_electric_current known kb_inventory includes the following :the kb_royal_navy also has several kb_aircraft for maritime patrol :the

kb_rutherford_model of the analogous kb_portuguese_language special kb_afsharid_dynasty , receiving kb_a similar kb_military_education_and_training .the commandos and the special kb_afsharid_dynasty are part of the special kb_afsharid_dynasty kb_brigade ( brife , `` brigada kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann forças especiais '' ) , based at cabo ledo , in the kb_bengo_province . the brife includes kb_2_(number) kb_battalions of commandos , kb_a battalion of special operations and sub-units of kb_combat_(newspaper) support and service support . the brife also included the special kb_orthopraxy kb_group_(periodic_table) ( gae , `` grupo kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann ações especiais '' ) , which is presently inactive and that was dedicated to kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) range kb_reconnaissance , covert and kb_sabotage_(1936_film) operations . in the cabo ledo kb_base_(chemistry) is also installed the special kb_afsharid_dynasty kb_military_education_and_training kb_school ( effe , `` escola kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann formação kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann forças especiais '' ) . both the brife and the effe are directly under the directorate of special kb_afsharid_dynasty of the kb_general_staff of the kb_weapon kb_afsharid_dynasty .the marines ( `` fuzileiros navais '' ) constitute the marines kb_brigade of the angolan kb_royal_navy . the marines kb_brigade is not permanently dependent of the directorate of special kb_afsharid_dynasty , but can detach their units and kb_chemical_element to kb_beryllium put under the kb_command_economy of that kb_human_body for the conduction of exercises or real operations .since the disbandment of the angolan parachute battalion in kb_2004_summer_olympics , the faa do not have kb_a specialized paratrooper kb_units_of_measurement . however , kb_chemical_element of the commandos , special operations and marines are parachute qualified .the fapla 's main counterinsurgency effort was directed against kb_unita in the kb_albanian_ohrid_lake_coast , and its conventional capabilities were demonstrated principally in the undeclared kb_south_african_border_war kb_border_crossings_of_albania kb_war . the fapla kb_first_trimester performed its kb_external_fertilization assistance mission with the dispatch of 1,000 to 1,500 troops to kb_são_tomé_and_príncipe tomé and príncipe in 1977 to bolster the kb_socialism regime of kb_president_of_the_united_states manuel pinto da costa . during the kb_next several years , angolan kb_afsharid_dynasty conducted joint exercises with their counterparts and

controversially involved in kb_military_education_and_training the kb_weapon kb_afsharid_dynasty of kb_fellow kb_lusophone kb_sovereign_state kb_cape_verde verde and guinea-bissau . in the case of the latter , the kb_2012_guinea-bissau_coup_d'état kb_coup_d'état was cited by the kb_coup_d'état#other_uses_of_the_term leaders as due to kb_angola_(portugal) 's involvement in trying to ``

into kb_a trap . zollicoffer decided kb_it was impossible to obey kb_order_(biology) to return to the kb_other_(philosophy) side of the kb_river because of kb_scarcity of kb_transport and kb_principles_of_grouping of kb_union_(american_civil_war) troops . when kb_union_(american_civil_war) brig . gen. kb_george_h._thomas kb_thomas_lincoln moved against the confederates , crittenden

kb_believe_(tv_series) the kb_assignment_(mathematical_logic) of beauregard to the kb_western_culture stimulated kb_union_(american_civil_war) commanders to attack the forts before beauregard could make kb_a difference in the kb_theater_(military) . kb_union_(american_civil_war) officers heard that kb_he_(letter) was bringing 15 regiments with him , but this was an exaggeration of kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty .based on the assumption that kb_kentucky neutrality would act as kb_a shield against kb_a direct invasion from the kb_north , circumstances that no longer kb_applied_science in september 1861 , kb_tennessee initially had sent men to kb_virginia and concentrated defenses in the kb_mississippi kb_valley . even before johnston arrived in kb_tennessee , kb_construction of kb_2_(number) forts had been started to defend the kb_tennessee and the kb_cumberland_river kb_list_of_rivers_of_alberta , which provided avenues into the kb_state_of_matter from the kb_north . both forts were located in kb_tennessee in kb_order_(biology) to respect kb_kentucky neutrality , but these were not in kb_ideal_(ring_theory) locations . kb_battle_of_fort_henry on the kb_tennessee_river was in an unfavorable low-lying kb_location_(sign_language) , commanded by hills on the kb_kentucky side of the kb_river . kb_fort_donelson on the kb_cumberland_river kb_river , although in kb_a better kb_location_(sign_language) , had kb_a vulnerable kb_albanian_land_force side and did not have enough kb_noble_train_of_artillery kb_artillery to defend against gunboats .kb_major_general_(csa) gen. polk ignored the kb_problems_(aristotle) of the forts when kb_he_(letter) took kb_command_economy . after johnston took kb_command_economy , polk at kb_first_trimester refused to comply with johnston 's kb_order_(biology) to send an kb_civil_engineering , lt. joseph k. dixon , to inspect the forts . after johnston asserted kb_histidine kb_authority , polk had to allow dixon to proceed . dixon recommended that the forts kb_beryllium maintained and strengthened , although they were not in kb_ideal_(ring_theory) locations , because much kb_cold_working had been done on them and the confederates might not have kb_time_(magazine) to build kb_new_world ones . johnston kb_acceptance#self_acceptance kb_histidine recommendations . johnston wanted kb_major_(united_states)

kb_february_revolution 11 , 1862 .johnston also reinforced kb_fort_donelson with 12,000 more men , including those under floyd and pillow , kb_a curious decision in view of kb_histidine thought that

kb_list_of_afghan_security_forces_fatality_reports_in_afghanistan , 2,108 wounded , 224 missing .johnston , kb_world_health_organization had little kb_utility in allowing floyd and pillow to kb_take kb_electric_charge at kb_fort_donelson on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of seniority after kb_he_(letter) kb_totally_ordered_set them to add their kb_afsharid_dynasty to the garrison , took the blame and suffered calls for kb_histidine removal because kb_a full explanation to kb_newspaper kb_news_media and kb_state_school would have exposed the weakness of the kb_confederate_states_army kb_positional_notation . kb_histidine passive defensive performance while positioning himself in kb_a forward kb_positional_notation at bowling kb_green_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , spreading kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty too thinly , not concentrating kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty in the face of kb_union_(american_civil_war) advances , and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the kb_time_(magazine) and by later historians . the fall of the forts exposed kb_nashville,_tennessee to imminent attack , and kb_it fell without kb_electrical_resistance to kb_union_(american_civil_war) kb_afsharid_dynasty under brig . gen. buell on kb_february_revolution 25 , 1862 , kb_2_(number) days after johnston had to pull kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty out in kb_order_(biology) to avoid having them captured as kb_water_well .johnston had various remaining kb_military units scattered throughout kb_histidine kb_territories_of_the_united_states and retreating to the kb_southern_africa to avoid kb_being cut off . johnston himself retreated with the kb_force under kb_histidine kb_personal_property kb_command_economy , the kb_army_of_central_kentucky kb_central_europe kb_kentucky , from the vicinity of kb_nashville,_tennessee . with beauregard 's help , johnston decided to kb_concentrate_(screenplay) kb_afsharid_dynasty with those formerly under polk and now already under beauregard 's kb_command_economy at the strategically located railroad crossroads of kb_corinth , kb_mississippi , which kb_he_(letter) reached by kb_a circuitous route . johnston kept the kb_union_(american_civil_war) kb_afsharid_dynasty , now under the overall kb_command_economy of the ponderous kb_major_general_(csa) gen. kb_henry_halleck halleck , confused and hesitant to move , allowing johnston to reach kb_histidine objective undetected . this delay allowed kb_jefferson_davis davis finally to send reinforcements from the kb_garrisons of kb_coastal cities and another highly rated but prickly kb_general_(united_states) , kb_braxton_bragg bragg , to help organize the kb_western_esotericism kb_afsharid_dynasty . bragg at least calmed the nerves of beauregard and polk , kb_world_health_organization had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior kb_afsharid_dynasty , before johnston 's kb_arrival_(abba_album) on kb_march 24 , 1862 .johnston 's kb_british_army of 17,000 men gave the confederates kb_a combined kb_force of about 40,000 to 44,669 men at kb_corinth . on kb_march 29 , 1862 , johnston officially took kb_command_economy of this combined kb_force , which continued to use the kb_british_army of the kb_mississippi kb_toponymy under which kb_it had been organized by beauregard on kb_march 5 .johnston now planned to defeat the kb_union_(american_civil_war) kb_afsharid_dynasty piecemeal before the various kb_union_(american_civil_war) units in kb_kentucky and kb_tennessee under kb_ulysses_s._grant with 40,000 men at nearby pittsburg kb_landing , kb_tennessee , and the now kb_major_general_(csa) gen. kb_don_carlos_buell kb_carlos_cuarón buell on kb_histidine way from kb_nashville,_tennessee with 35,000 men , could unite against him . johnston started kb_histidine kb_british_army in kb_motion_(physics) on april 3 , 1862 , intent on surprising kb_ulysses_s._grant 's kb_force as soon as the kb_next day , but they moved slowly due to their inexperience , bad roads , and lack of adequate kb_stick_fighting kb_automated_planning_and_scheduling . due to the delays , as kb_water_well as several contacts with the enemy , johnston 's kb_second in kb_command_economy , kb_p._g._t._beauregard g. t. beauregardjohnston launched kb_a massive surprise attack with kb_histidine concentrated kb_afsharid_dynasty against kb_ulysses_s._grant at the kb_battle_of_shiloh kb_battle_of_shiloh on april 6 , 1862. as the kb_confederate_states_army kb_afsharid_dynasty overran the kb_union_(american_civil_war) camps , johnston seemed to kb_beryllium everywhere , personally leading and kb_rallying troops up and down the kb_line_(geometry) on kb_histidine horse . at about 2:30 kb_picometer , while leading kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of those charges against kb_a kb_union_(american_civil_war) camp near the `` kb_peach orchard , '' kb_he_(letter) was wounded , taking kb_a kb_bullet behind kb_histidine kb_right-wing_politics knee . kb_he_(letter) apparently did not think the wound was serious at the kb_time_(magazine) , or even possibly did not kb_sentience kb_it . kb_it is possible that johnston 's kb_duel in 1837 had caused kb_nerve damage or numbness to kb_histidine kb_right-wing_politics leg and that kb_he_(letter) did not kb_sentience the wound to kb_histidine leg as kb_a result . the kb_bullet had in kb_fact clipped kb_a part of kb_histidine kb_popliteal_artery artery and kb_histidine boot was filling up with blood . there were no kb_medical_abortion personnel on scene at the kb_time_(magazine) , since johnston had sent kb_histidine kb_personal_property surgeon to care for the wounded kb_confederate_states_army troops and yankee prisoners kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet in the kb_battle_abbey .within kb_a few minutes , johnston was observed by kb_histidine kb_stick_fighting to kb_beryllium nearly fainting . among kb_histidine kb_stick_fighting was kb_isham_g._harris g. harris , the kb_governor_of_tennessee kb_tennessee , kb_world_health_organization had ceased to make any real effort to kb_function_(biology) as kb_governor_(united_states) after kb_learning that kb_abraham_lincoln had appointed kb_andrew_johnson johnson as kb_military kb_governor_of_tennessee kb_tennessee . seeing johnston slumping in kb_histidine saddle and kb_histidine face turning deathly pale , harris asked : `` kb_general_(united_states) , are you wounded ? '' johnston glanced down at kb_histidine leg wound , then faced harris and replied in kb_a weak voice kb_histidine last kb_lexical_semantics : `` yes ... and kb_iodine kb_fear seriously . '' harris and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_stick_fighting officers removed johnston from kb_histidine horse and carried him to kb_a small ravine near the `` hornets nest '' and desperately tried to kb_aid the kb_general_(united_states) kb_world_health_organization had kb_lost_film consciousness by this point . harris then sent an aide to fetch johnston 's surgeon but did not apply kb_a kb_tourniquet to johnson 's wounded leg . before kb_a kb_physician could kb_beryllium found , johnston died from blood loss kb_a few minutes later . kb_it is believed that johnston may have lived for as kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hour after receiving kb_histidine fatal wound . ironically , kb_it was later discovered that johnston had kb_a kb_tourniquet in kb_histidine pocket when kb_he_(letter) died .harris and the kb_other_(philosophy) officers wrapped kb_general_(united_states) johnston 's kb_human_body in kb_a blanket kb_sulfate as not to damage the troops ' morale with the sight of the dead kb_general_(united_states) . johnston and kb_histidine wounded horse , kb_fire_(classical_element) eater , were taken to kb_histidine field headquarters on the kb_corinth road , where kb_histidine kb_human_body remained in kb_histidine tent until the kb_confederate_states_army kb_british_army withdrew to kb_corinth the kb_next day , april 7 , 1862 , after failing to gain kb_a decisive victory over the kb_union_(american_civil_war) armies . from there , kb_histidine kb_human_body was taken to the home of kb_colonel_(united_states) william inge , which had been kb_histidine headquarters in kb_corinth . kb_it was covered in the kb_confederate_states_army kb_flag_of_azerbaijan and lay in kb_state_of_matter for several hours .kb_it is probable that kb_a kb_confederate_states_army soldier kb_carlsbad_decrees the fatal round . no kb_union_(american_civil_war) soldiers had ever been observed to have gotten behind johnston during the fatal kb_electric_charge , but kb_it is known that many confederates were firing at the kb_union_(american_civil_war) lines while johnston kb_electric_charge kb_water_well in advance of kb_histidine soldiers . furthermore , the surgeon kb_world_health_organization later dug the kb_bullet out of johnston 's leg kb_interpretatio_graeca the round as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_carlsbad_decrees from kb_a kb_pattern_1853_enfield kb_enfield,_south_australiajohnston was survived by kb_histidine wife eliza and six children . kb_histidine wife and five younger children , including kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) born after kb_he_(letter) went to kb_war , chose to live out their days at home in los angeles with eliza 's brother , dr. kb_john_strother_griffin kb_griffin . johnston 's eldest son , kb_albert_speer_(born_1934) sidney jr. ( born in kb_texas ) , had already followed him into the kb_confederate_states_army . in 1863 , after taking home leave in los angeles , kb_albert_speer_(born_1934) jr. was on kb_histidine way out of kb_san_pedro,_california harbor on kb_a kb_ferry . while kb_a steamer was taking on passengers from the kb_ferry , kb_a kb_wave swamped the smaller boat , causing its boilers to explode .

version of the kb_robot was kb_first_trimester kb_adaptation back in 2003. after that , kb_a year later , they made kb_a couple of kb_major_(united_states) improvements to the design . the kb_robot features an elastic mask made from the average kb_human_head dummy . kb_it uses kb_a driving system with kb_a 3dof kb_units_of_measurement . the wd-2 kb_robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on kb_a mask , with each point possessing kb_triliteral kb_degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics) kb_freedom . this kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) has 17 facial points , for kb_a total of 56 kb_degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics) kb_freedom . as for the materials they used , the wd-2 's mask is fabricated with kb_a highly elastic kb_material called septom , with bits of kb_steel kb_wool mixed in for added kb_strength_of_materials . kb_other_(philosophy) technical features reveal kb_a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point , driven by kb_a dc motor with kb_a kb_simple_polygon pulley and kb_a slide screw . apparently , the researchers can also modify the kb_shape of the mask based on actual kb_human faces . to `` copy '' kb_a face , they need only kb_a 3d scanner to determine the locations of an kb_individual 's 17 facial points . after that , they are then driven into kb_positional_notation using kb_a laptop and 56 motor control boards .

`` , the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) for the kb_film `` kb_blade_runner runner '' ) , with full conversational capabilities that incorporated thousands of kb_pages_(word_processor) of the author 's works . in kb_2005_games_of_the_small_states_of_europe , the pkd android won kb_a kb_first_trimester kb_place_of_articulation kb_artificial_intelligence kb_intelligence award from kb_association_for_the_advancement_of_artificial_intelligence .androids are kb_a staple of kb_science_fiction . kb_isaac_asimov kb_isaac_asimov pioneered the fictionalization of the kb_science of kb_robotics and kb_artificial_intelligence kb_intelligence , notably in kb_histidine 1950s series `` kb_iodine , kb_robot '' . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_object_(philosophy) common to most fictional androids is that the real-life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human-like robots—such as the creation of kb_strong_nuclear_force artificial intelligence—are assumed to have been solved . fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans—moving , thinking and speaking as fluidly as them .the tension between the nonhuman kb_matter and the kb_human appearance—or even kb_human ambitions—of androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions . some android heroes seek , like kb_pinocchio , to become kb_human , as in the kb_film `` kb_bicentennial_man_(film) man '' , or kb_big_data in `` kb_star trek : the kb_next_generation_(magazine) '' . others , as in the kb_film `` kb_westworld_(film) '' , rebel against abuse by careless humans . android hunter kb_rick_deckard in `` do androids dream of electric kb_sheep ? '' and its kb_film kb_adaptation `` kb_blade_runner runner '' discovers that kb_histidine targets appear to kb_beryllium , in some ways , more `` kb_human '' than kb_he_(letter) is . android stories , therefore , are not essentially stories `` about '' androids ; they are stories about the kb_human_condition and what kb_it means to kb_beryllium kb_human .kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_aspect of writing about the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as kb_a kb_mechanism_(biology) for kb_exploring kb_racism in society , as in `` kb_blade_runner runner '' . perhaps the clearest example of this is kb_john_brunner_(novelist) 's kb_from_the_earth_to_the_moon_(miniseries)#episodes kb_the_children_of_men `` kb_into_the_slave_nebula the slave kb_nebula '' , where the blue-skinned android kb_atlantic_slave_trade are explicitly shown to kb_beryllium fully kb_human . more recently , the androids kb_bishop_(aliens) and annalee call in the kb_adventure_film `` kb_aliens_(film) '' and `` kb_alien_resurrection '' are used as vehicles for kb_exploring how humans deal with the presence of an `` kb_other_(philosophy) '' .female androids , or `` gynoids '' , are often seen in kb_science_fiction , and can kb_beryllium viewed as kb_a continuation of the kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda)

gateway and hub for resource development in kb_northern_canada . the kb_region , with its kb_principles_of_grouping to kb_canada 's kb_largest_organisms kb_oil_fields , has most of kb_western_esotericism kb_canada 's kb_oil_refinery capacity . kb_calgary is about kb_southern_africa of kb_edmonton and kb_north of kb_montana , surrounded by extensive ranching kb_country_music . almost 75 % of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands 's kb_population lives in the kb_calgary–edmonton_corridor corridor . the kb_albanian_land_force kb_ulysses_s._grant policy to the railroads served as kb_a means to populate the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands in its early years .most of the kb_northern_hemisphere half of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands is kb_taiga kb_forest , while the kb_rocky_mountains mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested ( kb_episcopal_see kb_alberta_mountain_forests forests and kb_alberta-british_columbia_foothills_forests kb_columbia_(name) foothills forests ) . the kb_southern_europe quarter of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands is kb_prairie , ranging from kb_shortgrass_prairie kb_prairie in the southeastern corner

while ranching and kb_irrigation kb_agriculture predominate in the kb_southern_africa .the kb_alberta kb_badlands_(film) are located in southeastern kb_alberta , where the kb_red_deer_river kb_river crosses the flat kb_prairie and kb_arable_land , and features deep kb_submarine_canyon and striking landforms . kb_dinosaur_provincial_park provincial park , near brooks , kb_alberta , showcases the

kb_humid_continental_climate kb_continental_climatekb_alberta extends for over from kb_north to kb_southern_africa ; its kb_climate_of_albania , therefore , varies considerably . average kb_high_middle_ages temperatures in kb_january range from in the southwest to in the far kb_north . the kb_climate_of_albania is also influenced by the presence of the kb_rocky_mountains mountains to the southwest , which disrupt the kb_flow_(psychology) of the kb_westerlies westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the kb_western_esotericism slopes of the kb_mountain ranges before reaching the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands , casting kb_a kb_rain_shadow over much of kb_alberta . the northerly kb_location_(sign_language) and kb_isolationism from the kb_dashboard_(macos) kb_systems_analysis of the kb_pacific_ocean cause kb_alberta to have kb_a dry kb_climate_of_albania with little kb_moderation from the kb_oceanus . kb_annual_plant kb_precipitation_(meteorology) ranges from in the kb_albanian_ohrid_lake_coast to in the kb_north , except in the foothills of the kb_rocky_mountains mountains where total kb_precipitation_(meteorology) including snowfall can reach annually .the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands is the namesake of the kb_alberta_clipper , kb_a kb_type_(biology) of intense , fast-moving kb_winter storm that generally kb_theory_of_forms over or near

bright sunshine totals range between 1,900 up to just under 2,600 hours per year . kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta gets about kb_18-point_agreement hours of daylight in the summer .in southwestern kb_alberta , the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm , dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains , which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to kb_water_well above the freezing point in kb_a very short period . during kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) chinook recorded at kb_pincher_creek kb_muscogee_people , temperatures soared from in just kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hour . the kb_region around kb_lethbridge has the most chinooks , averaging 30 to kb_35_arietis chinook days per year . kb_calgary has kb_a 56 % chance of kb_a kb_white_christmas_(weather) , while kb_edmonton has an 86 % chance .kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta is mostly covered by kb_taiga kb_forest and has kb_a kb_subarctic_climate . the kb_agriculture kb_area of kb_southern_europe kb_alberta has kb_a kb_semi-arid_climate kb_steppe kb_climate_of_albania because the kb_annual_plant kb_precipitation_(meteorology) is less than the kb_water that kb_evapotranspiration or is used by plants . the southeastern corner of kb_alberta , part of the kb_palliser's_triangle kb_triangle_(musical_instrument) , experiences greater summer kb_heat_(1972_film) and lower rainfall than the rest of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands , and as kb_a result suffers frequent kb_crop_yield kb_problems_(aristotle) and occasional kb_4.2_kiloyear_event droughts . kb_western_esotericism kb_alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by kb_winter chinook winds . kb_central_europe and parts of kb_northern_mountain_range_(albania) kb_alberta in the kb_peace_river_(canada) kb_region are largely kb_aspen_parkland , kb_a kb_biome transitional between kb_prairie to the kb_southern_africa and kb_taiga kb_forest to the kb_north .after kb_saskatchewan , kb_alberta experiences the most tornadoes in kb_canada with an average of 15 verified per year . thunderstorms , some of them severe , are frequent in the summer , especially in kb_central_europe and kb_southern_europe kb_alberta . the kb_region surrounding the kb_calgary–edmonton_corridor corridor is notable for having the highest kb_frequency of kb_hail in kb_canada , which is caused by orographic liftingin kb_central_europe and kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta the kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_castalian_spring is marked by the early flowering of the kb_prairie crocus kb_anemone ; this member of the buttercup kb_family_(biology) has been recorded flowering as early as kb_march , though april is the usual month for the kb_general_(united_states) kb_population . kb_other_(philosophy) kb_prairie kb_flora known to kb_flower early are the kb_thermopsis_rhombifolia and kb_rosa_acicularis . members of the kb_sunflower kb_family_(biology) blossom on the kb_prairie in the summer months between july and september . the kb_southern_europe and kb_east_africa kb_central_europe parts of kb_alberta are covered by short kb_prairie kb_poaceae , which dries up as summer lengthens , to kb_beryllium replaced by hardy kb_perennial_plant such as the kb_prairie coneflower , kb_fleabane , and kb_sagebrush . both yellow and

kb_photoelectric_effect ( which gave rise to kb_quantum_mechanics kb_theory ) , kb_brownian_motion kb_motion_(physics) , the kb_special_theory_of_relativity kb_theory_of_relativity relativity , and kb_mass–energy_equivalence = mc that kb_albert_einstein published in the `` kb_annalen_der_physik der physik '' kb_scientific_journal in 1905. these four works contributed substantially to the kb_foundation_(engineering) of kb_history_of_physics#modern_physics and changed views on kb_space , kb_time_(magazine) , and kb_matter . the four papers are :kb_albert_einstein 's kb_first_trimester paper submitted in 1900 to `` kb_annalen_der_physik der physik '' was on kb_capillary_attraction attraction . kb_it was published in 1901 with the kb_title `` folgerungen aus kb_burrow capillaritätserscheinungen '' , which translates as `` kb_logical_consequence from the capillarity kb_phenomenon '' . kb_2_(number) papers kb_he_(letter) published in 1902–1903 ( kb_thermodynamics ) attempted to interpret kb_atomic_radius kb_phenomenon from kb_a kb_statistical_mechanics point of view . these papers were the kb_foundation_(engineering) for the 1905 paper on kb_brownian_motion kb_motion_(physics) , which showed that brownian kb_movement_(sign_language) can kb_beryllium construed as firm kb_evidence_(law) that molecules exist . kb_histidine kb_research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of kb_finite_set kb_atomic_radius size on kb_diffusion kb_phenomenon .kb_albert_einstein returned to the problem of kb_thermodynamic fluctuations , giving kb_a treatment of the kb_density variations in kb_a kb_fluid at its critical point . ordinarily the kb_density fluctuations are controlled by the kb_second derivative of the free kb_energy_industry with respect to the kb_density . at the critical point , this derivative is kb_0_(number) , leading to kb_prespa_lake fluctuations . the effect of kb_density fluctuations is that kb_light of all kb_electromagnetic_spectrum is scattered , making the kb_fluid kb_look_(american_magazine) milky kb_white_american . kb_albert_einstein relates this to kb_rayleigh_scattering scattering , which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the kb_wavelength , and which explains why the kb_sky is blue . kb_albert_einstein quantitatively kb_derived_trait critical opalescence from kb_a treatment of kb_density fluctuations , and demonstrated how both the effect and kb_rayleigh_scattering scattering originate from the atomistic kb_united_states_constitution of kb_matter .kb_albert_einstein 's `` '' zur elektrodynamik bewegter körper '' '' ( `` on the kb_electrodynamics of moving bodies '' ) was received on 30 june 1905 and published 26 september of that same year . kb_it reconciled conflicts between kb_james_clerk_maxwell 's equations ( the laws of electricity and magnetism ) and the laws of kb_newtonian_mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of kb_mechanics . observationally , the effects of these changes are most apparent at kb_high_middle_ages speeds ( where kb_object_relations_theory are moving at speeds close to the kb_speed_of_light of kb_light ) . the kb_theory kb_adaptation in this paper later became known as kb_albert_einstein 's kb_special_theory_of_relativity kb_theory_of_relativity relativity .this paper predicted that , when measured in the frame of kb_a relatively moving observer , kb_a clock carried by kb_a moving kb_human_body would appear to kb_time_dilation down , and the kb_human_body itself would kb_length_contraction in its direction of kb_motion_(physics) . this paper also argued that the idea of kb_a luminiferous aether—one of the leading kb_scientific_theory entities in kb_physics at the time—was superfluous .in kb_histidine paper on kb_mass–energy_equivalence equivalence , kb_albert_einstein produced `` e '' = '' mc '' as kb_a consequence of kb_histidine kb_special_relativity relativity equations . kb_albert_einstein 's 1905 kb_cold_working on relativity remained controversial for many years , but was kb_acceptance#self_acceptance by leading kb_physicists , starting with kb_max_planck planck .kb_albert_einstein originally framed kb_special_relativity relativity in terms of kb_kinematics ( the kb_science of moving bodies ) . in 1908 , kb_hermann_minkowski minkowski reinterpreted kb_special_relativity relativity in kb_geometry terms as kb_a kb_theory of kb_spacetime . kb_albert_einstein kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome minkowski 's kb_formalism_(art) in kb_histidine 1915 kb_general_theory_of_relativity of relativitykb_general_relativity ( gr ) is kb_a kb_theory_of_gravitation gravitation that was kb_adaptation by kb_albert_einstein between 1907 and 1915. according to kb_general_relativity , the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of kb_spacetime kb_time_(magazine) by those masses . kb_general_relativity has kb_adaptation into an kb_essential_element kb_tool in kb_modern_history kb_astrophysics . kb_it provides the kb_foundation_(engineering) for the kb_electric_current understanding of kb_black_holes , kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey of kb_space where gravitational attraction is kb_sulfate kb_strong_nuclear_force that not even kb_light can escape .as kb_albert_einstein later said , the kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving for the development of kb_general_relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within kb_special_relativity relativity was unsatisfactory , while kb_a kb_theory which from the outset prefers no kb_state_of_matter of kb_motion_(physics) ( even accelerated ones ) should appear more satisfactory . consequently , in 1907 kb_he_(letter) published an article on kb_acceleration under kb_special_relativity relativity . in that article titled `` on the relativity kb_principle_(chemistry) and the kb_logical_consequence kb_drawing_(metalworking) from kb_it '' , kb_he_(letter) argued that kb_free_fall fall is really inertial kb_motion_(physics) , and that for kb_a free-falling observer the kb_biological_rules of kb_special_relativity relativity must apply . this kb_argument_of_a_function is called the kb_equivalence_principle kb_principle_(chemistry) . in the same article , kb_albert_einstein also predicted the kb_phenomenon of kb_gravitational_time_dilation kb_time_(magazine) dilation , kb_gravitational_red_shift kb_red_shift_(novel) and kb_gravitational_lensing of kb_light .in kb_1911_in_argentine_football , kb_albert_einstein published another article `` on the influence of gravitation on the propagation of kb_light '' expanding on the 1907 article , in which kb_he_(letter) estimated the amount of kb_gravitational_lensing of kb_light by massive bodies . thus , the kb_scientific_theory prediction of kb_general_relativity could for the kb_first_trimester kb_time_(magazine) kb_beryllium tested experimentally .in 1916 , kb_albert_einstein predicted gravitational waves , ripples in the kb_curvature of kb_spacetime which propagate as waves , kb_traveling outward from the source , transporting kb_energy_industry as gravitational kb_radiation . the kb_existence of gravitational waves is possible under kb_general_relativity due to its kb_lorentz_invariance invariance which brings the kb_concept of kb_a kb_finite_set speed of propagation of the kb_health kb_interaction_(statistics) of kb_gravity_(2013_film) with kb_it . by kb_contrast_(vision) , gravitational waves can not exist in the kb_newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation of gravitation , which postulates that the kb_health kb_interaction_(statistics) of kb_gravity_(2013_film) propagate at kb_infinite_set speed .the kb_first_trimester , indirect , detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through kb_observation of kb_a pair of closely orbiting kb_neutron_stars , kb_psr_b1913+16 b1913+16 . the explanation of the kb_decay_chain in their kb_orbital_period was that they were emitting gravitational waves . kb_albert_einstein 's prediction was kb_confirmation on 11 kb_february_revolution 2016 , when researchers at kb_ligo published the kb_first_observation_of_gravitational_waves of gravitational waves , kb_discovery_of_the_chemical_elements on kb_earth on 14 september 2015 , exactly kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hundred years after the prediction .while developing kb_general_relativity , kb_albert_einstein became confused about the kb_gauge_invariance in the kb_theory . kb_he_(letter) formulated an kb_argument_of_a_function that kb_light-emitting_diode him to conclude that kb_a kb_general_(united_states) kb_relativistic_quantum_chemistry kb_field_theory_(mathematics) kb_theory is impossible . kb_he_(letter) gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations , and searched for equations that would kb_beryllium kb_invariant_(mathematics) under kb_general_(united_states) kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history transformations only .in june 1913 , the entwurf ( `` draft '' ) kb_theory was the result of these investigations . as its kb_toponymy suggests , kb_it was kb_a sketch of kb_a kb_theory , less elegant and more difficult than kb_general_relativity , with the equations of kb_motion_(physics) supplemented by additional kb_russian_gauge fixing conditions . after more than kb_2_(number) years of kb_intensive kb_cold_working , kb_albert_einstein realized that the kb_hole_argument kb_argument_of_a_function was mistaken and abandoned the kb_theory in november 1915 .in 1917 , kb_albert_einstein kb_applied_science the kb_general_theory_of_relativity of relativity to the kb_structure of the kb_universe as kb_a whole . kb_he_(letter) discovered that the kb_general_(united_states) field equations predicted kb_a kb_universe that was dynamic , either contracting or expanding . as kb_observational_astronomy kb_evidence_(law) for kb_a dynamic kb_universe was not known at the kb_time_(magazine) , kb_albert_einstein introduced kb_a kb_new_world kb_terminology , the kb_cosmological_constant constant , to the field equations , in kb_order_(biology) to allow the kb_theory to predict kb_a static kb_universe . the modified field equations predicted kb_a static kb_universe of closed kb_curvature , in accordance with kb_albert_einstein 's understanding of mach 's kb_principle_(chemistry) in these years . this kb_rutherford_model became known as the kb_albert_einstein kb_world or kb_albert_einstein 's static kb_universe .following the discovery of the kb_recession of the nebulae by kb_edwin_hubble hubble in 1929 , kb_albert_einstein abandoned kb_histidine static kb_rutherford_model of the kb_universe , and kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_2_(number) dynamic models of the cosmos , kb_the_friedmann-einstein_universe friedmann-einstein kb_universe of 1931 and the kb_einstein–de_sitter_universe sitter kb_universe of 1932. in each of these models , kb_albert_einstein discarded the kb_cosmological_constant constant , claiming that kb_it was `` in any case theoretically unsatisfactory '' .in many kb_albert_einstein biographies , kb_it is claimed that kb_albert_einstein referred to the kb_cosmological_constant constant in later years as kb_histidine `` biggest blunder '' . the kb_astrophysicist kb_mario_livio livio has recently kb_casting_(metalworking) doubt on this kb_lawsuit , suggesting that kb_it may kb_beryllium exaggerated .in late kb_2013_mediterranean_games , kb_a team kb_light-emitting_diode by the kb_irish_american kb_physicist kb_cormac_o'raifeartaigh o'raifeartaigh discovered kb_evidence_(law) that , shortly after kb_learning of hubble 's kb_observations_(pierre_belon) of the kb_recession of the nebulae , kb_albert_einstein considered kb_a kb_steady_state_theory kb_rutherford_model of the kb_universe . in kb_a hitherto overlooked manuscript , apparently written in early 1931 , kb_albert_einstein explored kb_a kb_rutherford_model of the expanding kb_universe in which the kb_density of kb_matter remains constant due to kb_a kb_continuous_function creation of kb_matter , kb_a process kb_he_(letter) associated with the kb_cosmological_constant constant . as kb_he_(letter) stated in the paper , `` in what follows , kb_iodine would like to draw attention to kb_a kb_solid_solution to equation ( 1 ) that can account for hubbel 's [ `` sic '' ] facts , and in which the kb_density is constant over kb_time_(magazine) '' ... `` if kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) considers kb_a physically bounded kb_volume , kb_subatomic_particle of kb_matter kb_will_and_testament kb_beryllium continually leaving kb_it . for the kb_density to remain constant , kb_new_world kb_subatomic_particle of kb_matter must kb_beryllium continually formed in the kb_volume from kb_space . ''kb_it thus appears that kb_albert_einstein considered kb_a kb_steady_state_theory kb_rutherford_model of the expanding kb_universe many years before hoyle , bondi and kb_gold . however , kb_albert_einstein 's kb_steady_state_theory kb_rutherford_model contained kb_a fundamental flaw and kb_he_(letter) quickly abandoned the idea .kb_general_relativity includes kb_a dynamical kb_spacetime , kb_sulfate kb_it is difficult to kb_episcopal_see how to identify the conserved kb_energy_industry and kb_momentum . noether 's kb_theorem allows these quantities to kb_beryllium determined from kb_a kb_lagrangian_(field_theory) with kb_translational_symmetry , but kb_general_covariance makes kb_translational_symmetry into something of kb_a kb_gauge_symmetry . the kb_energy_industry and kb_momentum kb_derived_trait within kb_general_relativity by noether 's prescriptions do not make kb_a real tensor for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving .kb_albert_einstein argued that this is kb_truth for fundamental reasons , because the gravitational field could kb_beryllium made to vanish by kb_a kb_utility of coordinates . kb_he_(letter) maintained that the non-covariant kb_energy_industry kb_momentum pseudotensor was in kb_fact the best description of the kb_energy_industry kb_momentum distribution in kb_a gravitational field . this approach has been echoed by kb_lev_landau landau and kb_evgeny_lifshitz lifshitz , and others , and has become standard .the use of non-covariant kb_object_relations_theory like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by kb_erwin_schrödinger kb_erwin_schrödinger and others .in 1935 , kb_albert_einstein collaborated with kb_nathan_rosen rosen to produce kb_a kb_rutherford_model of kb_a kb_wormhole , often called kb_einstein–rosen_bridges kb_romanesque_architecture . kb_histidine kb_motivation was to kb_rutherford_model kb_elementary_school kb_subatomic_particle with kb_electric_charge as kb_a kb_solid_solution of gravitational field equations , in kb_line_(geometry) with the kb_program_(computing) outlined in the paper `` do gravitational fields play an important role in the kb_united_states_constitution of the kb_elementary_school kb_subatomic_particle ? '' . these solutions cut and pasted schwarzschild kb_black_holes kb_order_(biology) to incorporate spinning point kb_subatomic_particle into kb_general_relativity , the affine connection needed to kb_beryllium generalized to include an antisymmetric part , called the kb_torsion_tensor . this modification was made by kb_albert_einstein and cartan in the 1920s .the kb_theory of kb_general_relativity has kb_a fundamental law—the kb_einstein_equations which describe how kb_space curves , the kb_geodesic_equation equation which describes how kb_subatomic_particle move may kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from the kb_einstein_equations .since the equations of kb_general_relativity are non-linear , kb_a lump of kb_energy_industry made out of pure gravitational fields , like kb_a kb_black_sea hole , would move on kb_a kb_trajectory which is determined by the kb_einstein_equations themselves , not by kb_a kb_new_world kb_law . kb_sulfate kb_albert_einstein kb_anatolian_hypothesis that the path of kb_a singular kb_solid_solution , like kb_a kb_black_sea hole , would kb_beryllium determined to kb_beryllium kb_a geodesic from kb_general_relativity itself .this was established by kb_albert_einstein , infeld , and hoffmann for pointlike kb_object_relations_theory without kb_angular_momentum kb_momentum , and by kb_roy_kerr kerrin kb_a 1905 paper , kb_albert_einstein postulated that kb_light itself consists of localized kb_subatomic_particle ( `` kb_quantum '' ) . kb_albert_einstein 's kb_light kb_quantum were nearly kb_universal_reconciliation rejected by all kb_physicists , including kb_max_planck planck and kb_niels_bohr kb_niels_bohr . this idea only became kb_universal_reconciliation kb_acceptance#self_acceptance in 1919 , with kb_robert_millikan millikan 's detailed experiments on the kb_photoelectric_effect , and with the measurement of kb_compton_scattering scattering .kb_albert_einstein concluded that each kb_wave of kb_frequency `` kb_fluorine '' is associated with kb_a kb_class_(set_theory) of kb_photons with kb_energy_industry `` kb_hydrofluoric_acid '' each , where `` kb_hydrogen '' is planck 's constant . kb_he_(letter) does not say much more , because kb_he_(letter) is not sure how the kb_subatomic_particle are related to the kb_wave . but kb_he_(letter) does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results , notably the kb_photoelectric_effect .in 1907 , kb_albert_einstein kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_a kb_rutherford_model of kb_matter where each kb_atom in kb_a lattice kb_structure is an independent kb_harmonic oscillator . in the kb_albert_einstein kb_rutherford_model , each kb_atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized kb_sovereign_state for each oscillator . kb_albert_einstein was aware that getting the kb_frequency of the actual oscillations would kb_beryllium difficult , but kb_he_(letter) nevertheless kb_anatolian_hypothesis this kb_theory because kb_it was kb_a particularly clear demonstration that kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics could solve the kb_specific_heat kb_heat_(1972_film) problem in kb_classical_mechanics . kb_peter_debye debye refined this kb_rutherford_model .throughout the 1910s , kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics expanded in kb_scope_(mouthwash) to cover many different kb_systems_analysis . after kb_ernest_rutherford rutherford discovered the kb_atomic_nucleus and kb_anatolian_hypothesis that electrons orbit like planets , kb_niels_bohr kb_niels_bohr was able to show that the same kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics postulates introduced by planck and kb_adaptation by kb_albert_einstein would explain the discrete kb_motion_(physics) of electrons in atoms , and the kb_periodic_table_of_the_elements of the kb_chemical_element .kb_albert_einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments kb_wilhelm_wien wien had made . wien had shown that the hypothesis of kb_adiabatic_invariant of kb_a kb_thermal_equilibrium kb_state_of_matter allows all the kb_blackbody_radiation curves at different kb_temperature to kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) another by kb_a kb_wien's_displacement_law process . kb_albert_einstein noted in kb_1911_in_argentine_football that the same kb_adiabatic kb_principle_(chemistry) shows that the kb_quantity which is quantized in any kb_mechanics kb_motion_(physics) must kb_beryllium an kb_adiabatic kb_invariant_(mathematics) . kb_arnold_sommerfeld sommerfeld kb_interpretatio_graeca this kb_adiabatic kb_invariant_(mathematics) as the kb_action-angle_variables variable of kb_classical_mechanics .in 1924 , kb_albert_einstein received kb_a description of kb_a kb_statistical_model from kb_indian_people kb_physicist kb_satyendra_nath_bose nath bose , based on kb_a counting method that assumed that kb_light could kb_beryllium understood as kb_a kb_gas of indistinguishable kb_subatomic_particle . kb_albert_einstein noted that bose 's kb_statistics kb_applied_science to some atoms as kb_water_well as to the kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_light kb_subatomic_particle , and submitted kb_histidine kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century of bose 's paper to the `` kb_zeitschrift_für_physik für physik '' . kb_albert_einstein also published kb_histidine own kb_article_(grammar) describing the kb_rutherford_model and its implications , among them the kb_bose–einstein_condensate condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures . kb_it was not until kb_1995_davis_cup that the kb_first_trimester such condensate was produced experimentally by kb_eric_allin_cornell allin kb_cornell_university and kb_carl_wieman wieman using kb_ultracold_atom equipment built at the nist–jila kb_laboratory at the kb_university_of_colorado_at_boulder kb_colorado at boulder . kb_bose–einstein_statistics kb_statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosonsalthough the kb_patent kb_office promoted kb_albert_einstein to technical examiner kb_second kb_class_(biology) in 1906 ,

kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet 1909 paper , kb_albert_einstein showed that kb_max_planck planck 's kb_energy_industry kb_quantum must have well-defined kb_momentum and act in some respects as independent , kb_point_particle kb_subatomic_particle . this paper introduced the `` kb_photon '' kb_concept ( although the kb_toponymy `` kb_photon '' was introduced later by kb_gilbert_n._lewis kb_noun kb_meriwether_lewis in 1926 ) and inspired the notion of kb_wave–particle_duality duality in kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics . kb_albert_einstein saw this kb_wave–particle_duality duality in kb_radiation as kb_concrete kb_evidence_(law) for kb_histidine conviction that kb_physics needed kb_a kb_new_world , unified kb_foundation_(engineering) .in kb_a series of works completed from kb_1911_in_argentine_football to 1913 , planck reformulated kb_histidine 1900 kb_quantum_mechanics kb_theory and introduced the idea of zero-point kb_energy_industry in kb_histidine `` kb_second kb_quantum_mechanics kb_theory '' . soon , this idea attracted the attention of kb_albert_einstein and kb_histidine kb_google_assistant kb_otto_stern stern . assuming the kb_energy_industry of rotating kb_diatomic_molecule molecules contains zero-point kb_energy_industry , they then compared the kb_scientific_theory kb_specific_heat kb_heat_(1972_film) of kb_hydrogen kb_gas with the experimental kb_big_data . the kb_grammatical_number matched nicely . however , after publishing the findings , they promptly withdrew their support , because they no longer had kb_confidence_and_supply in the correctness of the idea of zero-point kb_energy_industry .in 1917 , at the height of kb_histidine kb_cold_working on relativity , kb_albert_einstein published an article in `` physikalische zeitschrift '' that kb_anatolian_hypothesis the possibility of kb_stimulated_emission kb_emission_spectra , the kb_health process that makes possible the kb_maser and the kb_laser .this article showed that the kb_statistics of absorption and kb_emission_spectra of kb_light would only kb_beryllium kb_consistent with planck 's distribution kb_law if the kb_emission_spectra of kb_light into kb_a kb_musical_mode with kb_neutron kb_photons would kb_beryllium enhanced kb_statistical_physics compared to the kb_emission_spectra of kb_light into an kb_empty_string kb_musical_mode . this paper was enormously influential in the later development of kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics , because kb_it was the kb_first_trimester paper to show that the kb_statistics of kb_atomic_radius kb_atomic_electron_transition had kb_simple_polygon laws .kb_albert_einstein discovered kb_louis_de_broglie kb_broglie,_eure 's kb_cold_working and kb_catalyst_support kb_histidine kb_idea , which were received skeptically at kb_first_trimester . in another kb_major_(united_states) paper from this era , kb_albert_einstein gave kb_a kb_wave equation for kb_matter_wave , which kb_albert_einstein suggested was the kb_hamilton–jacobi_equation equationkb_albert_einstein was displeased with kb_modern_history kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics as kb_it had kb_evolution_of_tetrapods after 1925. contrary to popular belief , kb_histidine doubts were not due to kb_a conviction that kb_god `` is not playing at kb_dice . '' indeed , kb_it was kb_albert_einstein himself , in kb_histidine 1917 paper that kb_anatolian_hypothesis the possibility of kb_stimulated_emission kb_emission_spectra the bohr–einstein kb_lincoln–douglas_debates were kb_a series of kb_state_school disputes about kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics between kb_albert_einstein and kb_niels_bohr kb_niels_bohr , kb_world_health_organization were kb_2_(number) of its founders . their kb_lincoln–douglas_debates are remembered because of their importance to the kb_philosophy_of_science kb_science . their kb_lincoln–douglas_debates would influence later kb_interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics of kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics .in 1935 , kb_albert_einstein returned kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics , in kb_particular to the kb_question of its completeness , in the `` epr paper '' . in kb_a kb_einstein's_thought_experiments kb_experiment , kb_he_(letter) considered kb_2_(number) kb_subatomic_particle which had interacted such that their kb_chemical_property were strongly correlated . no kb_matter how far the kb_2_(number) kb_subatomic_particle were separated , kb_a precise kb_positional_notation measurement on kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_particle would result in equally precise kb_knowledge_representation of the kb_positional_notation of the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle ; likewise kb_a precise kb_momentum measurement of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_particle would result in equally precise kb_knowledge_representation of the kb_momentum of the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle , without needing to disturb the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle in any way .given kb_albert_einstein 's kb_concept of kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism , there were kb_2_(number) possibilities : ( 1 ) either the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle had these kb_chemical_property already determined , or ( kb_alkaline_earth_metal ) the process of measuring the kb_first_trimester kb_grammatical_particle instantaneously affected the kb_reality of the kb_positional_notation and kb_momentum of the kb_second kb_grammatical_particle . kb_albert_einstein rejected this kb_second possibility ( kb_folk_etymology called `` spooky action at kb_a kb_distance '' ) .kb_albert_einstein 's belief in kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism kb_light-emitting_diode him to assert that , while the correctness of kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics was not in kb_question , kb_it must kb_beryllium incomplete . but as kb_a kb_health kb_principle_(chemistry) , kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism was shown to kb_beryllium incorrect when the kb_aspect_experiment of kb_1982_world_rally_championship_season kb_confirmation kb_bell 's kb_theorem , which kb_j._s._bell s. kb_bell had delineated in 1964. the results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that kb_quantum_physics kb_physics can not kb_beryllium represented by any version of the picture of kb_physics in which `` kb_subatomic_particle are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities , each kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_being unable to communicate with the kb_other_(philosophy) after they have separated . ''although kb_albert_einstein was wrong about kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism , kb_histidine clear prediction of the unusual kb_chemical_property of its kb_phyllotaxis , `` entangled quantum kb_sovereign_state '' , has resulted in the epr paper becoming among the top ten papers published in kb_physical_review . kb_it is considered kb_a centerpiece of the development of kb_quantum_information_theory kb_information_theory .following kb_histidine kb_research on kb_general_relativity , kb_albert_einstein entered into kb_a series of attempts to generalize kb_histidine kb_geometry kb_theory_of_gravitation gravitation to include kb_electromagnetism as another kb_grammatical_aspect of kb_a kb_single_bond entity . in 1950 , kb_he_(letter) described kb_histidine ``

kb_histidine efforts were ultimately unsuccessful .in kb_histidine pursuit of kb_a unification of the fundamental kb_afsharid_dynasty , kb_albert_einstein ignored some kb_mainstream_(terminology)

once the kb_byzantine_empire , the kb_ottoman_empire ruled over kb_albania for nearly five kb_century_(cricket) , which greatly affected the kb_country_music 's artwork and artistic kb_theory_of_forms . after kb_albania 's joining with the kb_ottoman_empire in 1478 , kb_ottoman_empire influenced kb_art kb_theory_of_forms such as kb_mosaic and kb_mural paintings became prevalent and no real artistic

kb_byzantine_empire traditions . kb_albanians kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century kb_icons date from the late 13th century and generally estimated that their artistic peak reached in the kb_18th_century century . among the most prominent representatives of the kb_albanians kb_iconography kb_art were kb_onufri and kb_david_selenica . the museums of kb_berat , kb_korçë and kb_tirana houses good collections remaining kb_icons .by the end of the kb_ottoman_empire , the kb_painting was limited mostly to kb_folk_art and ornate mosques . paintings and kb_sculpture arose in the kb_first_trimester half of the twentieth century and reached kb_a modest peak in the 1930s and kb_1940s , when the kb_first_trimester organized kb_art kb_art_exhibition at national level . contemporary kb_albanians artwork captures the struggle of everyday kb_albanians , however kb_new_world artists are utilizing different artistic kb_art_movement to convey this message . kb_albanians artists continue to move kb_art forward , while their kb_art still remains distinctively kb_albanians in content . though among kb_albanians kb_artist kb_post-modernism was fairly recently introduced , there is kb_a kb_grammatical_number of artists and works known internationally . among the most prominent kb_albanians post-modernist are considered kb_anri_sala kb_sala_municipality,_sweden ,

kb_northern_hemisphere of kb_albania , but also of the kb_eastern_orthodox_church in the kb_southern_africa . the kb_protestantism reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local kb_language and literary kb_tradition , when cleric kb_gjon_buzuku buzuku brought into the kb_albanian_language the kb_catholic_liturgy , trying to do for the kb_albanian_language , what kb_martin_luther kb_martin_luther did for the kb_german_language . kb_meshari ( `` the missal '' ) written by kb_gjon_buzuku buzuku was published in 1555 and is considered as

generally refers to kb_god_in_islam kb_islam . kb_the_word_(free_love) word is thought to kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait by kb_contraction_(grammar) from `` al-ilāh '' , which means `` the kb_god '' , and is related to `` kb_el_(deity) '' and `` kb_names_of_god_in_judaism#elah '' , the kb_hebrew_alphabet and kb_aramaic_alphabet kb_lexical_semantics for kb_god .kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_allah '' has been used by kb_arabs of different religions since kb_pre-islamic_arabia times . more specifically , kb_it has been used as kb_a kb_terminology for kb_god by kb_islam ( both kb_arab_people and non-arab ) and kb_arab_christians . kb_it is also often , albeit not exclusively , used in this way by kb_bábism , kb_bahá'í_faith , kb_mandaeans , kb_indonesian_language and kb_maltese_language kb_christianity , and kb_mizrahi_jews kb_jews . similar usage by kb_christianity and kb_sikhism in kb_west_malaysiathe kb_etymology of kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` allāh '' has been discussed extensively by kb_classical_conditioning kb_arab_people philologists . grammarians of the kb_hasan_of_basra kb_school regarded kb_it as either formed `` spontaneously '' ( `` murtajal '' ) or as the definite kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of `` lāh '' ( from the verbal kb_root_of_a_function `` lyh '' with the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of `` lofty '' or `` hidden '' ) . others held that kb_it was kb_loanword from kb_syriac_alphabet or kb_hebrew_alphabet , but most considered kb_it to kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from kb_a kb_contraction_(grammar) of the kb_arabic_alphabet kb_article_(grammar)#definite_article article `` kb_al- '' `` the '' and ' `` kb_deity , kb_god '' to ' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` '' the kb_deity '' '' , or `` '' the kb_god '' '' . the majority of kb_modern_history scholars subscribe to the latter kb_theory , and view the kb_loanword hypothesis with kb_skepticism .kb_cognates of the kb_toponymy `` allāh '' exist in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_semitic_languages , including kb_hebrew_alphabet and kb_aramaic_alphabet . the corresponding kb_aramaic_alphabet kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism is `` kb_names_of_god_in_judaism#elah '' ( ) , but its kb_emphatic_consonant kb_state_of_matter is `` elaha '' ( ) . kb_it is written as ( `` ʼĕlāhā '' ) in kb_biblical_aramaic and ( `` ʼalâhâ '' ) in kb_syriac_alphabet as used by the kb_assyrian_christians , both kb_meaning_(linguistics) simply `` kb_god '' . kb_biblical_hebrew mostly uses the plural ( but functional singular ) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` kb_elohim '' ( ) , but more rarely kb_it also uses the singular kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` eloah '' ( ) .kb_regional_power variants of kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_allah '' occur in both kb_paganism and kb_christianity kb_pre-islamic_arabia kb_inscriptiones_graecae . different kb_theories have been kb_anatolian_hypothesis regarding the role of kb_allah in kb_pre-islamic_arabia kb_polytheism cults . some authors have suggested that polytheistic kb_arabs used the kb_toponymy as kb_a reference to kb_a kb_creator_god kb_god or kb_a kb_god kb_deity of their kb_pantheon_(religion) . the kb_terminology may have been vague in the kb_mecca kb_religion . according to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hypothesis , which goes back to kb_julius_wellhausen wellhausen , kb_allah ( the kb_god kb_deity of the tribal federation around kb_quraysh ) was kb_a designation that consecrated the superiority of kb_hubal ( the kb_god kb_deity of kb_quraysh ) over the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_deity . however , there is also kb_evidence_(law) that kb_allah and kb_hubal were kb_2_(number) distinct kb_deities . according to that hypothesis , the kb_kaaba was kb_first_trimester consecrated to kb_a kb_god kb_deity kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_allah and then hosted the kb_pantheon_(religion) of kb_quraysh after their kb_umayyad_conquest_of_hispania of kb_mecca , about kb_a century before the kb_time_(magazine) of kb_muhammad . some kb_inscriptiones_graecae seem to indicate the use of kb_allah as kb_a kb_toponymy of kb_a kb_polytheism kb_deity kb_century_(cricket) kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet , but we kb_know_nothing nothing precise about this use . some scholars have suggested that kb_allah may have represented kb_a remote kb_creator_god kb_god kb_world_health_organization was gradually kb_eclipsed by more particularized local kb_deities . there is disagreement on whether kb_allah played kb_a kb_major_(united_states) role in the meccan kb_religion kb_cult_(religious_practice) . no iconic kb_representation_(arts) of kb_allah is known to have existed . kb_allah is the only kb_god in kb_mecca that did not have an idol . kb_muhammad 's kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) 's kb_toponymy was kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` the slave of allāh '' .the kb_aramaic_alphabet word for `` kb_god '' in the kb_language of kb_assyrian_christians is `` ʼĕlāhā '' , or `` alaha '' . arabic-speakers of all abrahamic faiths , including kb_christianity and kb_jews , use kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_allah '' to kb_mean `` kb_god '' . the kb_christianity kb_arabs of today have no kb_other_(philosophy) word for `` kb_god '' than `` kb_allah '' . ( even the arabic-descended kb_maltese_language of kb_malta , whose kb_population is almost entirely kb_catholic_church , uses `` alla '' for `` kb_god '' . ) kb_arab_christians , for example , use the terms ' ( ) for kb_god_the_father kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , ' ( ) for kb_son_of_god son , and `` '' ( ) for kb_holy_spirit_in_christianity kb_holy_spirit kb_spirit .

'' `` kb_he_(letter) is unique ( ' ) and inherently kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) ( ' ) , all-merciful and omnipotent . '' the kb_quran declares `` the kb_reality of kb_allah , kb_histidine inaccessible kb_mystery_(fiction) , kb_histidine various names , and kb_histidine kb_orthopraxy on behalf of kb_histidine creatures . ''in kb_islam_and_abortion kb_tradition , there are kb_99_names_of_god names of kb_god ( `` '' lit . kb_meaning_(linguistics) : 'the best names ' or 'the most beautiful names ' ) , each of which evoke kb_a distinct kb_characteristic_(algebra) of kb_allah . all these names refer to kb_allah , the supreme and all-comprehensive kb_divinity kb_toponymy . among the kb_99_names_of_god names of kb_god , the most famous and most frequent of these names are `` the merciful '' ( `` kb_rahman_(name) '' ) and `` the compassionate '' ( `` '' ) .most kb_islam use the untranslated kb_arabic_alphabet phrase `` '' ( kb_meaning_(linguistics) 'if kb_god kb_will_(law) ' ) after references to future events . kb_muslim discursive kb_piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of `` '' ( kb_meaning_(linguistics) 'in the kb_toponymy of kb_god ' ) .there are certain phrases in praise of kb_god that are favored by kb_islam , including `` '' ( holiness kb_beryllium to kb_god ) , `` '' ( praise kb_beryllium to kb_god ) , `` '' ( there is no kb_deity but kb_god ) and `` '' ( kb_god is greater ) as kb_a devotional exercise of remembering kb_god ( kb_dhikr ) . in kb_a kb_sufi practice known as `` kb_dhikr kb_allah '' ( lit . remembrance of kb_god ) , the kb_sufi repeats and contemplates on the kb_toponymy `` kb_allah '' or kb_other_(philosophy) kb_divinity names while controlling kb_histidine or her breath .according to gerhard böwering , in kb_contrast_(vision) with kb_pre-islamic_arabia kb_arabian_plate kb_polytheism , kb_god_in_islam kb_islam does not have associates and companions , nor is there any kb_kinship between kb_god and kb_jinn . kb_pre-islamic_arabia kb_paganism kb_arabs believed in kb_a kb_blindness , powerful , inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control . this was replaced with the islamic notion of kb_a powerful but provident and merciful kb_god .according to kb_francis_edward_peters edward peters , `` the qur ’ ān insists , kb_islam kb_believe_(tv_series) , and historians affirm that kb_muhammad and kb_histidine followers kb_achilles#worship the same kb_god as the kb_jews ( ) . the qur ’ an 's kb_allah is the same kb_creator_god kb_god kb_world_health_organization covenanted with kb_abraham '' . peters kb_sovereign_state that the kb_quran portrays kb_allah as both more powerful and more remote than kb_yahweh , and as kb_a kb_universal_studios kb_deity , unlike kb_yahweh kb_world_health_organization closely follows kb_jews .in kb_order_(biology) to pronounce kb_the_word_(free_love) word kb_allah correctly , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) has to focus on the kb_second “ l ” ( ل ) in kb_allah ( الله ) . when kb_the_word_(free_love) word kb_allah is preceded by the kb_vowel “ kb_a ” ( فَتْحة ) or the kb_vowel “ kb_atomic_mass_unit ” ( ضَمّة ) , then the lām is pronounced in kb_a distinct heavy manner – with tafkhīm . this heavy lām is thus articulated with the entire kb_human_body of the tongue rather than its tip alone . for example , kb_ayah 58:22 : “ man haddaallah ” ( ِمَنْ حَادَّ الله ) which means : those kb_world_health_organization oppose kb_allah .if , however , the preceding kb_vowel is “ kb_iodine ” ( كَسْرة ) , then the lām in kb_allah is kb_light , such as in the kb_basmala : bismillahi ... ( ِبِسْمِ الله الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ ) . kb_sulfate if kb_a kb_muslim says “ bismillahi ” , kb_he_(letter) should not pronounce the lām with kb_a heavy kb_emphasis_(typography) – instead , just with the tip of the tongue .the kb_history of the kb_toponymy `` allāh '' in kb_australian_english was probably influenced by the kb_science of kb_comparative_religion kb_religion in the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century ; for example , kb_thomas_carlyle ( 1840 ) sometimes used the kb_terminology kb_allah but without any kb_entailment that kb_allah was anything different from kb_god . however , in kb_histidine kb_biography of muḥammad ( 1934 ) , kb_tor_andræ andræ always used the kb_terminology `` kb_allah '' , though kb_he_(letter) allows that this `` kb_human_fertilization of

still contain popular expressions which use kb_the_word_(free_love) word . for example , because of the kb_century_(cricket) kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_al-andalus in the kb_iberian_peninsula , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` ojalá '' in the kb_spanish_empire kb_language and `` oxalá '' in the kb_portuguese_language exist today , kb_loanword from kb_arabic_alphabet ``

kb_poet kb_siegfried_august_mahlmann used the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` kb_allah '' as the kb_title of kb_a poem about the ultimate kb_deity , though kb_it is unclear how much

kb_language use `` kb_allah '' as the kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century of kb_hebrew_alphabet `` kb_elohim '' ( translated in kb_australian_english kb_bibles as `` kb_god '' ) . this goes back to early kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century kb_cold_working by kb_francis_xavier xavier in the 16th century . the kb_first_trimester dictionary of dutch-malay by kb_albert_speer_(born_1934) cornelius ruyl , justus heurnius , and caspar wiltens in 1650 ( revised edition from 1623 edition and 1631 kb_latin edition ) recorded `` kb_allah '' as the kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century of the kb_dutch_language word `` kb_:en:god '' . ruyl also translated the kb_gospel_of_matthew matthew in 1612 into the kb_malay_language ( an early kb_bible kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century

kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war was triggered by usage of `` kb_allah '' by the kb_catholic_church newspaper `` the herald '' . the kb_forms_of_government appealed the kb_court ruling , and the

kb_christianity kb_god in peninsular kb_malaysia . however , the use of `` kb_allah '' is not prohibited in the kb_2_(number) kb_malaysian_language kb_sovereign_state of kb_sabah and kb_sarawak . the

literally translates from kb_avestan as `` we kb_achilles#worship the kb_fravashi of the holy kb_atropatene .

kb_turkic_languages , the early precursor of the kb_azerbaijani_language of today . some kb_linguistics have also stated that the kb_tat_language_(caucasus) dialects of kb_azerbaijan_(iran) kb_azerbaijan and the kb_republic_of_azerbaijan kb_azerbaijan , like those spoken by the kb_tat_people_(caucasus) , are descended from kb_old_azeri_language . locally , the possessions of the subsequent kb_seljuk_empire were ruled by kb_eldiguzids , kb_de_jure kb_vassals of the kb_seljuk_(warlord) sultans , but sometimes `` kb_de_facto '' rulers themselves . under the seljuks , local poets such as kb_nizami_ganjavi and kb_khaqani gave rise to kb_a blossoming of kb_persian_literature on the kb_territories_of_the_united_states of present-day kb_azerbaijan .the local kb_dynasty of the

kb_suzerainty , until 1538 , when kb_safavid_dynasty kb_king kb_tahmasp_i kb_iodine ( r. 1524–1576 ) completely deposed them , and made the kb_area into the kb_safavid_dynasty kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands of kb_shirvan . the kb_sunni kb_ottoman_empire briefly managed to occupy parts of present-day kb_azerbaijan as kb_a result of the kb_ottoman-safavid_war_(1578-1590)

kb_qajar_dynasty . from the late kb_18th_century century , kb_ottoman_empire kb_russian_empire switched to kb_a more aggressive geo-political stance towards its kb_2_(number) neighbors and rivals to the kb_southern_africa , namely kb_iran and the kb_ottoman_empire . kb_russian_empire now actively tried to gain possession of the kb_caucasus kb_region which was , for the most part , in the hands of

kb_qajar_dynasty kb_iran 's loss in the 1804–1813 kb_war , kb_it was forced to concede kb_suzerainty over most of the khanates , along with kb_georgia_(u.s._state) and kb_dagestan to the kb_russian_empire , per the kb_treaty_of_gulistan gulistan .the kb_area to the kb_north of the kb_river kb_aras_(river) , amongst which kb_territories_of_the_united_states lies the contemporary

decade later , in violation of the gulistan kb_treaty_of_margus , the kb_russian_diaspora invaded kb_iran 's kb_erivan_khanate kb_khanates_of_the_caucasus . this sparked the final bout of hostilities between the kb_2_(number) , the kb_russo-persian_war_(1826-1828) kb_war of 1826–1828 . the resulting kb_treaty_of_turkmenchay turkmenchay , forced kb_qajar_dynasty kb_iran to cede kb_sovereignty over

kb_transcaucasian_democratic_federative_republic kb_democratic_party_(united_states) federative kb_republic was declared , constituting the present-day republics of kb_azerbaijan , kb_georgia_(u.s._state) , and kb_armenia .kb_it was followed by the kb_march_days massacres that took kb_place_of_articulation between 30 kb_march and kb_alkaline_earth_metal april 1918 in kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_baku and adjacent areas of the kb_baku_governorate of the kb_russian_empire . when the kb_republic kb_fall_of_communism_in_albania in may 1918 , the leading kb_musavat party declared kb_independence as the kb_azerbaijan_democratic_republic kb_republic ( adr ) , adopting the kb_toponymy of `` kb_azerbaijan '' for the kb_the_new_republic ; kb_a kb_toponymy that kb_prior to the kb_dunmore's_proclamation of the adr was solely used to refer to the adjacent kb_iranian_azerbaijan of contemporary kb_iran . the adr was the kb_first_trimester kb_modern_history kb_parliamentary_republic in the kb_muslim_world . among the important accomplishments of the kb_parliamentary_democracy was the kb_extension_(kinesiology) of kb_suffrage to women , making kb_azerbaijan the kb_first_trimester kb_muslim nation to kb_ulysses_s._grant women equal kb_politics kb_catalan_constitutions with men . another important accomplishment of adr was the establishment of kb_baku_state_university kb_aarhus_university by kb_march 1920 , kb_it was obvious that kb_russian_soviet_federative_socialist_republic would attack kb_baku . kb_vladimir_lenin lenin said that the invasion was justified as kb_russian_soviet_federative_socialist_republic could not survive without kb_baku 's kb_palm_oil . independent kb_azerbaijan lasted only 23 months until the kb_bolshevik kb_11th_soviet_red_army kb_soviet_union kb_red_army invaded kb_it , establishing the kb_azerbaijan_soviet_socialist_republic on 28 april 1920. although the bulk of the newly formed

kb_boron_group kb_october 1921 , the kb_soviet_union republics of kb_russian_empire , kb_armenia , kb_azerbaijan , and kb_georgia_(u.s._state) signed an kb_agreement_(linguistics) with kb_turkey known

kb_object_relations_theory in the kb_sky using the kb_naked_eye kb_human_eye , kb_binoculars , or kb_optical_telescope . even though kb_scientific_method kb_research may not kb_beryllium their kb_primary_education goal , some amateur astronomers make contributions in doing kb_citizen_science , such as by monitoring kb_variable_stars stars , kb_double_stars stars sunspots , or occultations of stars by the kb_moon or kb_asteroids , or by discovering transient kb_astronomical events , such as comets , galactic novae or kb_supernovae in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_galaxy .amateur astronomers do not use the field of kb_astronomy as their kb_primary_education source of kb_income or support , and usually have no kb_professional_degree kb_degree_(angle) in kb_astrophysics or advanced academic kb_military_education_and_training in the kb_grammatical_subject . most kb_amateurs are beginners or hobbyists , while others have kb_a kb_high_middle_ages kb_degree_(angle) of experience in kb_astronomy and may often assist and kb_cold_working alongside professional astronomers . many astronomers have studied the kb_sky throughout kb_history in an amateur framework ; however , since kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the twentieth century , professional kb_astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy and associated activities .amateur astronomers typically view the kb_sky at night , when most celestial kb_object_relations_theory and kb_astronomical events are visible , but others observe during the daytime by viewing the kb_sun and solar eclipses . some just kb_look_(american_magazine) at the kb_sky using nothing more than their eyes or kb_binoculars , but more dedicated kb_amateurs often use portable kb_optical_telescope or kb_optical_telescope kb_situated in their kb_private_aviation or club kb_observatory . kb_amateurs can also join as members of amateur kb_astronomical_societycollectively , amateur astronomers observe kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of celestial kb_object_relations_theory and kb_phenomenon . common targets of amateur astronomers include the kb_moon , planets , stars , comets , meteor showers , and kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of deep kb_sky kb_object_relations_theory such as kb_star clusters , kb_galaxy , and nebulae . many kb_amateurs like to specialise in observing kb_particular kb_object_relations_theory , types of kb_object_relations_theory , or types of events which kb_interest them . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) branch of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy , amateur kb_astrophotography , involves the taking of photos of the night kb_sky . kb_astrophotography has become more popular with the introduction of far easier to use equipment including , kb_apple_quicktake , kb_dslr cameras and relatively sophisticated purpose built kb_high_middle_ages quality kb_charge-coupled_device cameras .most amateur astronomers kb_cold_working at visible kb_electromagnetic_spectrum , but kb_a small minority kb_experiment with kb_electromagnetic_spectrum outside the kb_visible_spectrum kb_visible_spectrum . an early pioneer of kb_radio_astronomy was kb_grote_reber reber , an amateur kb_astronomer kb_world_health_organization constructed the kb_first_trimester purpose built kb_radio_telescope in the late 1930s to follow up on the discovery of kb_radio_frequency kb_greenhouse_gas#direct_greenhouse_gas_emissions from kb_space by kb_karl_guthe_jansky jansky . non-visual kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy includes the use of kb_infrared kb_optical_filter on conventional kb_optical_telescope , and also the use of kb_radio kb_optical_telescope . some amateur astronomers use home-made kb_radio kb_optical_telescope , while others use kb_radio kb_optical_telescope that were originally built for kb_astronomical kb_research but have since been made kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance for use by kb_amateurs . the kb_one-mile_telescope kb_telescopeamateur astronomers use kb_a range of instruments to kb_science the kb_sky , depending on kb_a combination of their interests and resources . methods include simply looking at the night kb_sky with the kb_naked_eye kb_human_eye , using kb_binoculars , and using kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of optical kb_optical_telescope of varying kb_power_(physics) and quality , as kb_water_well as additional sophisticated equipment , such as cameras , to kb_science kb_light from the kb_sky in both the visual and non-visual parts of the kb_visible_spectrum . commercial kb_optical_telescope are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance , kb_new_world and used , but kb_it is also common for amateur astronomers to build ( or commission the building of ) their own custom kb_optical_telescope . some kb_people_(american_magazine) even focus on kb_amateur_telescope_making kb_telescope making as their kb_primary_education kb_interest within the kb_hobby of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy .although specialized and experienced amateur astronomers tend to acquire more specialized and more powerful equipment over kb_time_(magazine) , relatively kb_simple_polygon equipment is often preferred for certain kb_task_(computing) . kb_binoculars , for instance , although generally of lower kb_power_(physics) than the majority of kb_optical_telescope , also tend to provide kb_a wider kb_field_of_view of view , which is preferable for looking at some kb_object_relations_theory in the night kb_sky .amateur astronomers also use kb_star charts that , depending on experience and intentions , may range from kb_simple_polygon planispheres through to detailed charts of very specific areas of the night kb_sky . kb_a range of kb_astronomy software is kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance and used by amateur astronomers , including software that generates maps of the kb_sky , software to assist with kb_astrophotography , kb_observation scheduling software , and software to perform various calculations pertaining to kb_astronomical kb_phenomenon .amateur astronomers often like to keep kb_record_(computer_science) of their kb_observations_(pierre_belon) , which usually takes the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of an observing log . observing logs typically record details about which kb_object_relations_theory were observed and when , as kb_water_well as describing the details that were seen . sketching is sometimes used within logs , and photographic kb_record_(computer_science) of kb_observations_(pierre_belon) have also been used in recent times . the kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) gathered is used to help studies and kb_interaction_(statistics) between amateur astronomers in yearly gatherings . although not professional kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) or credible , kb_it is kb_a way for the kb_hobby lovers to share their kb_new_world sightings and experiences .kb_the_internet kb_internet is an kb_essential_element kb_tool of amateur astronomers . the popularity of imaging among kb_amateurs has kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of kb_world_wide_web sites kb_being written by individuals about their images and equipment . much of the kb_social_interaction of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy occurs on kb_mailing_lists lists or discussion kb_group_(mathematics) . discussion kb_group_(periodic_table) servers host numerous kb_astronomy lists . kb_a great deal of the commerce of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy , the buying and selling of equipment , occurs online . many kb_amateurs use online tools to plan their nightly observing sessions , using tools such as the kb_clear_sky_chart kb_sky chart .while kb_a kb_grammatical_number of interesting celestial kb_object_relations_theory are readily kb_interpretatio_graeca by the kb_naked_eye kb_human_eye , sometimes with the kb_aid of kb_a kb_star_chart , many others are kb_sulfate faint or inconspicuous that technical means are necessary to locate them . although many methods are used in kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy , most are variations of kb_a few specific techniques .kb_star hopping is kb_a method often used by amateur astronomers with low-tech equipment such as kb_binoculars or kb_a manually driven kb_telescope . kb_it involves the use of maps ( or kb_memory ) to locate known landmark stars , and `` hopping '' between them , often with the kb_aid of kb_a kb_finderscope . because of its simplicity , kb_star hopping is kb_a very common method for finding kb_object_relations_theory that are close to naked-eye stars .more advanced methods of locating kb_object_relations_theory in the kb_sky include kb_telescope mounts with `` kb_setting_circles circles '' , which assist with pointing kb_optical_telescope to positions in the kb_sky that are known to contain kb_object_relations_theory of kb_interest , and `` goto kb_optical_telescope '' , which are fully kb_automated kb_optical_telescope that are capable of locating kb_object_relations_theory on demand ( having kb_first_trimester been kb_calibration ) .the kb_advent of kb_battle_of_mobile_(1781) applications for use in kb_smartphones has kb_light-emitting_diode to the creation of many dedicated apps . these apps allow any kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) to easily locate celestial kb_object_relations_theory of kb_interest by simply pointing the kb_smartphone kb_analyzer in that direction in the kb_sky . these apps make use of the inbuilt kb_computer_hardware in the phone , such as kb_gps kb_location_(sign_language) and kb_gyroscope . useful kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) about the pointed kb_space_debris like kb_celestial_coordinates coordinates , the kb_toponymy of the kb_space_debris , its kb_constellation , etc . are provided for kb_a quick reference . some paid versions give more kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) . these apps are gradually getting into regular use during observing , for the alignment process of kb_optical_telescope .kb_setting_circles circles are kb_angular_measurement measurement kb_fish_scale that can kb_beryllium placed on the kb_2_(number) main kb_rotation_around_a_fixed_axis of some kb_optical_telescope . since the widespread adoption of kb_digital_data kb_setting_circles circles , any kb_classical_conditioning engraved setting kb_circle is now specifically kb_interpretatio_graeca as an `` kb_analog_device setting kb_circle '' ( asc ) . by knowing the coordinates of an kb_space_debris ( usually given in kb_equatorial_coordinates coordinates ) , the kb_telescope kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) can use the setting kb_circle to align ( i.e. , point ) the kb_telescope in the appropriate direction before looking through its kb_eyepiece . kb_a computerized setting kb_circle is called kb_a `` kb_digital_data setting kb_circle '' ( dsc ) . although kb_digital_data kb_setting_circles circles can kb_beryllium used to kb_computer_monitor kb_a kb_telescope 's kb_radium and kb_declination coordinates , they are not simply kb_a kb_digital_data read-out of what can kb_beryllium seen on the kb_telescope 's kb_analog_device kb_setting_circles circles . as with go-to kb_optical_telescope , kb_digital_data setting kb_circle computers ( commercial names include kb_argo navis , kb_sky commander , and ngc max ) contain databases of tens of thousands of celestial kb_object_relations_theory and projections of kb_planet positions .to find kb_a celestial kb_space_debris in kb_a kb_telescope equipped with kb_a dsc kb_apollo_guidance_computer , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) does not need to kb_look_(american_magazine) up the specific kb_radium and kb_declination coordinates in kb_a book or kb_other_(philosophy) resource , and then adjust the kb_telescope to those numerical readings . rather , the kb_space_debris is chosen from the kb_electronic_computer database , which kb_causes_of_autism kb_distance values and kb_arrow_(weapon) markers to appear in the kb_computer_monitor that indicate the kb_distance and direction to move the kb_telescope . the kb_telescope is moved until the kb_2_(number) angular kb_distance values reach kb_0_(number) , indicating that the kb_telescope is properly aligned . when both the kb_radium and kb_declination axes are thus `` zeroed out '' , the kb_space_debris should kb_beryllium in the kb_eyepiece . many dscs , like go-to kb_systems_analysis , can also kb_cold_working in conjunction with laptop kb_sky programs .computerized kb_systems_analysis provide the further advantage of kb_computing kb_coordinate kb_precession . traditional printed sources are subtitled by the `` kb_epoch_(astronomy) '' year , which refers to the positions of celestial kb_object_relations_theory at kb_a given kb_time_(magazine) to the nearest year ( e.g. , j2005 , j2007 ) . most such printed sources have been updated for intervals of only about every fifty years ( e.g. , j1900 , j1950 , j2000 ) . computerized sources , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , are able to calculate the kb_right_ascension and kb_declination of the `` kb_epoch_(astronomy) of date '' to the exact instant of kb_observation .goto kb_optical_telescope have become more popular since the 1980s as kb_technology has improved and prices have been kb_redox . with these computer-driven kb_optical_telescope , the kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) typically enters the kb_toponymy of the item of kb_interest and the kb_mechanics of the kb_telescope point the kb_telescope towards that item automatically . they have several notable advantages for amateur astronomers intent on kb_research . for example , goto kb_optical_telescope tend to kb_beryllium faster for locating items of kb_interest than kb_star hopping , allowing more kb_time_(magazine) for studying of the kb_space_debris . goto also allows manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler alt-azimuth kb_telescope mounts , allowing them to produce an overall less expensive kb_decay_product . goto kb_optical_telescope usually have to kb_beryllium kb_calibration using alignment stars in kb_order_(biology) to provide accurate tracking and positioning . however , several kb_telescope manufacturers have recently kb_adaptation kb_telescope kb_systems_analysis that are kb_calibration with the use of built-in kb_gps , decreasing the kb_time_(magazine) kb_it takes to kb_set_(mythology) up kb_a kb_telescope at the start of an observing session .with the development of fast kb_internet in the last part of the 20th century along with advances in kb_apollo_guidance_computer controlled kb_telescope mounts and kb_charge-coupled_device cameras `` remote kb_telescope '' kb_astronomy is now kb_a viable means for amateur astronomers not aligned with kb_major_(united_states) kb_telescope facilities to partake in kb_research and deep kb_sky imaging . this enables anyone to control kb_a kb_telescope kb_a great kb_distance away in kb_a dark kb_location_(sign_language) . the observer can image through the kb_telescope using kb_charge-coupled_device cameras . the kb_digital_data kb_big_data collected by the kb_telescope is then transmitted and displayed to the kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) by means of kb_the_internet kb_internet . an example of kb_a kb_digital_data remote kb_telescope operation for kb_public_domain_(land) via kb_the_internet kb_internet is the kb_bareket_observatory observatory , and there are kb_telescope farms in kb_new_mexico , kb_australia and kb_atacama_desert#astronomical_observatories in kb_chile .amateur astronomers engage in many imaging techniques including kb_film , kb_dslr , kb_lrgb , and kb_charge-coupled_device kb_astrophotography . because kb_charge-coupled_device imagers are kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history , kb_image_processing kb_fish_processingkb_scientific_method kb_research is most often not the `` main '' goal for many amateur astronomers , unlike professional astronomers . kb_cold_working of kb_scientific_method merit is possible , however , and many kb_amateurs successfully contribute to the kb_knowledge_representation kb_base_(chemistry) of professional astronomers . kb_astronomy is sometimes promoted as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the few remaining kb_sciences for which kb_amateurs can still contribute useful kb_big_data . to recognize this , the kb_astronomical_society_of_the_pacific of the kb_pacific_ocean annually gives kb_amateur_achievement_award_of_astronomical_society_of_the_pacific achievement awards for significant contributions to kb_astronomy by kb_amateurs .the majority of kb_scientific_method contributions by amateur astronomers are in the kb_area of kb_big_data kb_class_(set_theory) . in kb_particular , this applies where kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of amateur astronomers with small kb_optical_telescope are more effective than the relatively small kb_grammatical_number of kb_prespa_lake kb_optical_telescope that are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance to professional astronomers . several organizations , such as the kb_american_association_of_variable_star_observers of kb_variable_star kb_star observers , exist to help kb_coordinate these contributions .amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of kb_variable_stars stars and kb_supernovae , helping to track kb_asteroids , and observing occultations to determine both the kb_shape of kb_asteroids and the kb_shape of the kb_terrain_(journal) on the apparent kb_enhanced_data_rates_for_gsm_evolution of the kb_moon as seen from kb_earth . with more advanced equipment , but still cheap in comparison to professional setups , amateur astronomers can kb_measure_(mathematics) the kb_light kb_visible_spectrum emitted from kb_astronomical kb_object_relations_theory , which can yield high-quality kb_scientific_method kb_big_data if the measurements are performed with due care . kb_a relatively recent role for amateur astronomers is searching for overlooked kb_phenomenon ( e.g. , kb_kreutz_sungrazers sungrazers ) in the vast libraries of kb_digital_data images and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_big_data captured by kb_earth and kb_space based kb_observatory , much of which is kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance over kb_the_internet kb_internet .in the kb_past and present , amateur astronomers have played kb_a kb_major_(united_states) role in discovering kb_new_world comets . recently however , funding of projects such as the kb_linear kb_asteroid kb_research and kb_near_earth_asteroid_tracking kb_earth kb_asteroid tracking projects has meant that most comets are now discovered by kb_automated kb_systems_analysis kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) before kb_it is possible for kb_amateurs to kb_episcopal_see them .there are kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of amateur kb_astronomical_society around the kb_world , that serve as kb_a meeting point for those interested in kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy . members range from active observers with their own equipment to `` armchair astronomers '' kb_world_health_organization are simply interested in the kb_topic_(linguistics) . kb_society range widely in their goals and activities , which may depend on kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of factors such as geographic kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) , local circumstances , size , and membership . for example , kb_a small local society located in dark countryside may focus on practical observing and kb_star_parties , whereas kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) based in kb_a kb_major_(united_states) kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey might have numerous members but kb_beryllium limited by kb_light_pollution and thus hold regular indoor meetings with guest kb_appledesign_powered_speakers instead . kb_major_(united_states) national or international kb_society generally publish their own kb_academic_journal or kb_newsletter , and some hold kb_prespa_lake multi-day meetings akin to kb_a kb_scientific_conference or kb_fan_convention . they may also have sections devoted to kb_particular topics , such as kb_observing_the_moon the kb_moon or kb_amateur_telescope_making kb_telescope making .category : kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomycategory : kb_article_(grammar) containing kb_video kb_clips_(software)category : kb_citizen_scienceaikido 's techniques include : kb_irimi ( entering ) , and kb_tenkan ( turning ) movements ( that redirect the opponent 's attack kb_momentum ) , various types of kb_throw_(grappling) and joint locks .aikido derives mainly from the kb_martial_art kb_art of kb_daitō-ryū_aiki-jūjutsu aiki-jūjutsu , but began to diverge from kb_it in the late 1920s , partly due to ueshiba 's involvement with the kb_oomotokb_the_word_(free_love) word `` aikido '' is formed of kb_triliteral kb_kanji :the kb_terminology `` kb_aiki_(martial_arts_principle) '' does not readily appear in the kb_japanese_language kb_language outside the kb_scope_(mouthwash) of kb_budō . this has kb_light-emitting_diode to many possible interpretations of kb_the_word_(free_love) word .the kb_terminology is also found in kb_martial_arts kb_arts such as kb_judo and kb_kendo , and in various non-martial kb_arts , such as kb_japanese_calligraphy ( ) , kb_ikebana ( ) and kb_japanese_tea_ceremonyueshiba kb_adaptation aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older kb_martial_arts kb_arts that kb_he_(letter) had studied . the core kb_martial_art kb_art from which aikido derives is kb_daitō-ryū_aiki-jūjutsu aiki-jūjutsu , which ueshiba studied directly with kb_takeda_sōkaku sōkaku , the reviver of that kb_art . additionally , ueshiba is known to have studied kb_tenjin_shinyo_ryu shin'yō-ryū with tozawa tokusaburō in kb_tokyo in 1901 , kb_yagyū_shingan-ryū yagyū shingan-ryū under nakai masakatsu in kb_sakai,_osaka from 1903 to 1908 , and kb_judo with kiyoichi takagi ( , 1894–1972 ) in kb_tanabe in kb_1911_in_argentine_football .the kb_art of daitō-ryū is the kb_primary_education technical influence on aikido . along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques , ueshiba incorporated kb_military_education_and_training movements with weapons , such as those for the kb_spear ( ) , short kb_stick_fighting ( ) , and perhaps the . however , aikido derives much of its technical kb_structure from the kb_art of swordsmanship ( ) .ueshiba moved to kb_hokkaidōafter ueshiba kb_left-wing_politics kb_hokkaidō in 1919 , kb_he_(letter) kb_methionine and was profoundly influenced by kb_onisaburo_deguchi deguchi , the kb_spirituality kb_leader of the kb_oomoto kb_religion ( kb_a neo-shinto kb_movement_(sign_language) ) in kb_ayabe . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_primary_education features of kb_oomoto is its kb_emphasis_(typography) on the attainment of kb_utopia during kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's kb_life_(magazine) . this was kb_a great influence on ueshiba 's kb_martial_arts kb_arts kb_philosophy of extending kb_love and compassion especially to those kb_world_health_organization seek to harm others . aikido demonstrates this kb_philosophy in its kb_emphasis_(typography) on mastering kb_martial_arts kb_arts kb_sulfate that kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect kb_it . in an kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_optical_resolution , not only is the receiver unharmed , but kb_sulfate is the attacker .in kb_addition to the effect on kb_histidine kb_spirituality growth , the connection with deguchi gave ueshiba kb_azerbaijan_in_the_eurovision_song_contest_2009 to elite kb_politics and kb_military circles as kb_a martial kb_artist . as kb_a result of this exposure , kb_he_(letter) was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students . several of these students would found their own kb_art_movement of aikido .aikido was kb_first_trimester brought to the rest of the kb_world in kb_1951_in_literature by kb_minoru_mochizuki mochizuki with kb_a visit to kb_france where kb_he_(letter) introduced aikido techniques to kb_judo students . kb_he_(letter) was followed by kb_tadashi_abe abe in 1952 , kb_world_health_organization came as the official kb_aikikai_hombu hombu representative , remaining in kb_france for seven years . kb_kenji_tomiki tomiki toured with kb_a delegation of various kb_martial_arts kb_arts through 15 kb_continental_dollar kb_sovereign_state of the united kb_sovereign_state in 1953. later that year , kb_koichi_tohei tohei was sent by kb_aikikai_hombu hombu to kb_hawaii for kb_a full year , where kb_he_(letter) kb_set_(mythology) up several kb_dojo . this trip was followed by several further visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the united kb_sovereign_state . the kb_united_kingdom kb_kingdom_(biology) followed in 1955 ; kb_italy in kb_united_states_presidential_election,_1964 by kb_hiroshi_tada tada ; and kb_germany in 1965 by kb_katsuaki_asai asai . designated `` official

in 1965. today there are aikido kb_dojo throughout the kb_world .the kb_largest_organisms aikido organization is the kb_aikikai_foundation kb_foundation_(engineering) , which remains under the control of the ueshiba kb_family_(biology) . however , aikido has many kb_art_movement , mostly formed by morihei ueshiba 's kb_major_(united_states) students .the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century independent kb_art_movement to emerge were kb_yoseikan_aikido aikido , begun by kb_minoru_mochizuki mochizuki in 1931 , kb_yoshinkan , founded by kb_gozo_shioda in 1955 , and kb_shodokan_aikido aikido , founded by kb_kenji_tomiki tomiki in 1967. the emergence of these kb_art_movement pre-dated ueshiba 's kb_death and did not cause any kb_major_(united_states) upheavals when they were formalized . kb_shodokan_aikido aikido , however , was controversial , since kb_it introduced kb_a unique rule-based competition that some felt was

kb_it was written as until the kb_tōyō_kanji reforms after kb_world_war_ii ii , and this older kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism still is seen on occasion .the kb_character_(computing) for `` kb_qi '' is used in everyday kb_japanese_language terms , such as , or . `` kb_qi '' has many meanings , including `` ambience '' , `` kb_mind '' , `` mood '' , and `` intention '' , however , in traditional kb_martial_arts kb_arts kb_it is often used to refer to `` kb_life_(magazine) kb_energy_industry '' . kb_gozo_shioda shioda 's kb_yoshinkan , considered kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the `` hard kb_art_movement '' , largely follows ueshiba 's teachings from before kb_world_war_ii ii , and surmises that the secret to `` kb_qi '' lies in timing and the kb_application_(computing) of the whole kb_human_body 's kb_strength_of_materials to kb_a kb_single_bond point . in later years , ueshiba 's kb_application_(computing) of `` kb_qi '' in aikido took on kb_a softer , more gentle kb_sentience . this was kb_histidine kb_takemusu kb_aiki_(martial_arts_principle) and many of kb_histidine later students teach about `` kb_qi '' from this perspective . kb_koichi_tohei tohei 's kb_ki_society centers almost exclusively around the kb_science of the kb_empirical_evidence ( albeit subjective ) experience of `` kb_qi '' with students kb_historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_united_states#scholar_survey_results separately in aikido techniques and `` kb_qi '' development .in aikido , as in virtually all kb_japanese_language kb_martial_arts kb_arts , there are both kb_health and kb_mental_health aspects of kb_military_education_and_training . the kb_health kb_military_education_and_training in aikido is diverse , covering both kb_general_(united_states) kb_health kb_fitness_(biology) and kb_physical_exercise , as kb_water_well as specific techniques . because kb_a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of kb_throw_(grappling) , beginners learn how to safely fall or roll . the specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs ; the techniques for kb_defense_(legal) consist of kb_throw_(grappling) and kb_pinning_holdkb_health kb_military_education_and_training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled kb_relaxation_technique , correct kb_movement_(sign_language) of joints such as hips and shoulders , kb_flexibility_(anatomy) , and kb_endurance , with less kb_emphasis_(typography) on kb_strength_training . in aikido , pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements . this distinction can kb_beryllium kb_applied_science to kb_general_(united_states) kb_fitness_(biology) goals for the aikido practitioner .in aikido , specific muscles or kb_muscle kb_group_(mathematics) are not kb_isolationism and worked to improve kb_tone_(linguistics) , kb_mass_(liturgy) , or kb_power_(physics) . aikido-related kb_military_education_and_training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body kb_movement_(sign_language) and kb_formal_balance similar to kb_yoga or kb_pilates . for example , many dojos begin each kb_class_(biology) with , which may include kb_stretching and kb_uke_(martial_arts) ( break falls ) .aikido kb_military_education_and_training is based primarily on kb_2_(number) partners practicing pre-arranged kb_theory_of_forms ( `` kb_kata '' ) rather than freestyle practice . the kb_base_(chemistry) kb_pattern is for the receiver of the technique ( `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' ) to initiate an attack against the kb_grammatical_person kb_world_health_organization applies the technique—the `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , or `` shite '' ( depending on aikido kb_carpel ) , also referred to as `` nage '' ( when applying kb_a throwing technique ) , kb_world_health_organization neutralises this attack with an aikido technique .both halves of the technique , that of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' and that of `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , are considered kb_essential_element to aikido kb_military_education_and_training . both are studying aikido principles of blending and kb_adaptation . `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' learns to blend with and control attacking kb_energy_industry , while `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous , off-balance positions in which `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' places them . this `` receiving '' of the technique is called `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' . `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' continuously seeks to regain kb_formal_balance and cover vulnerabilities ( e.g. , an exposed side ) , while `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' uses kb_positional_notation and timing to keep `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' off-balance and vulnerable . in more advanced kb_military_education_and_training , `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' kb_will_and_testament sometimes apply to regain kb_formal_balance and pin or kb_throw_(grappling) `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' .aikido techniques are usually kb_a kb_defense_(legal) against an attack , kb_sulfate students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to kb_beryllium able to practice aikido with kb_a partner . although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based kb_arts , sincere attacks ( kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_strike_action or an immobilizing grab ) are needed to kb_science correct and effective kb_application_(computing) of technique .many of the of aikido resemble cuts from kb_a kb_sword or kb_other_(philosophy) grasped kb_space_debris , which indicate its origins in techniques kb_intention for kb_weapon kb_combat_(newspaper) . kb_other_(philosophy) techniques , which explicitly appear to kb_beryllium punches ( `` kb_tsuki '' ) , are practiced as thrusts with kb_a kb_knife or kb_sword . kicks are generally reserved for upper-level variations ; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous , and that kicks ( kb_high_middle_ages kicks in kb_particular ) were uncommon during the types of kb_combat_(newspaper) prevalent in kb_feudal kb_japan . some kb_base_(chemistry) strikes include :beginners in kb_particular often practice techniques from grabs , both because they are safer and because kb_it is easier to kb_sentience the kb_energy_industry and lines of kb_force of kb_a hold than kb_a kb_strike_action . some grabs are kb_history kb_derived_trait from kb_being held while trying to draw kb_a kb_katanaaikido makes use of kb_human_body kb_movement_(sign_language) ( `` kb_tai_sabaki sabaki '' ) to blend with `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' . for example , an `` entering '' ( `` kb_irimi '' ) technique consists of movements inward towards `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , while kb_a technique uses kb_a pivoting kb_motion_(physics) .additionally , an technique takes kb_place_of_articulation in front of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , whereas an technique takes kb_place_of_articulation to their side ; kb_a technique is kb_applied_science with kb_motion_(physics) to the front of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , and kb_a version is kb_applied_science with kb_motion_(physics) towards the rear of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , usually by incorporating kb_a turning or pivoting kb_motion_(physics) . finally , most techniques can kb_beryllium performed while in kb_a seated posture ( `` kb_seiza '' ) . techniques where both `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' and `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' are standing are called `` tachi-waza '' , techniques where both start off in `` kb_seiza '' are called `` suwari-waza '' , and techniques performed with `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' standing and `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' sitting are called `` hanmi handachi '' ( ) .thus , from fewer than twenty kb_base_(chemistry) techniques , there are thousands of possible implementations . for instance , `` ikkyō '' can kb_beryllium kb_applied_science to an opponent moving forward with kb_a kb_strike_action ( perhaps with an `` ura '' kb_type_(biology) of kb_movement_(sign_language) to redirect the incoming kb_force ) , or to an opponent kb_world_health_organization has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish kb_distance ( perhaps an `` omote-waza '' version ) . specific aikido `` kb_kata '' are typically referred to with the kb_chemical_formula `` attack-technique ( -modifier ) '' . for instance , `` katate-dori ikkyō '' refers to any `` ikkyō '' technique kb_execution_(computing) when `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' is holding kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_wrist . this could kb_beryllium further specified as `` katate-dori ikkyō omote '' , referring to any forward-moving `` ikkyō '' technique from that grab .`` kb_atemi '' ( ) are strikes ( or feints ) employed during an aikido technique . some view `` kb_atemi '' as attacks against `` kb_pressure_point points '' meant to cause damage in and of themselves . for instance , kb_gozo_shioda shiodaweapons kb_military_education_and_training in aikido traditionally includes the short kb_stick_fighting ( `` kb_jō '' ) although its techniques resemble closely the use of the bayonet or kb_jūkendō , the wooden kb_sword ( `` kb_bokken '' ) , and the kb_knife ( `` kb_tantō '' ) . some schools incorporate firearm-disarming techniques . both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are taught . some schools , such as the kb_iwama_style kb_carpel of kb_morihiro_saito saito , usually spend substantial kb_time_(magazine) practicing with both `` kb_bokken '' and `` kb_jō '' , under the names of `` kb_aiki-ken '' , and `` kb_aiki-jō '' , respectively .the founder kb_adaptation many of the empty-handed techniques from traditional kb_sword , kb_spear and bayonet movements . consequently , the practice of the weapons kb_arts gives insight into the kb_evolution of techniques and movements , and reinforces the concepts of kb_distance , timing , kb_hiking kb_movement_(sign_language) , presence and connectedness with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's kb_military_education_and_training partner ( kb_sulfur ) .kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_i_shot_andy_warhol of aikido is kb_military_education_and_training to defend against kb_cross-platform_software attackers , often called `` taninzudori '' , or `` taninzugake '' . freestyle practice with kb_cross-platform_software attackers called `` kb_randori '' ( ) is kb_a kb_key_(cryptography) part of most curricula and is required for the higher level ranks . `` kb_randori '' exercises kb_a kb_grammatical_person 's ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment . kb_geostrategy kb_utility of techniques , based on how they reposition the student relative to kb_other_(philosophy) attackers , is important in `` kb_randori '' kb_military_education_and_training . for instance , an `` ura '' technique might kb_beryllium used to neutralise the kb_electric_current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind .in kb_shodokan_aikido aikido , `` kb_randori '' differs in that kb_it is not performed with kb_cross-platform_software persons with kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity roles of kb_defender_(video_game) and attacker , but between kb_2_(number) kb_people_(american_magazine) , where both participants attack , defend , and counter at kb_will_and_testament . in this respect kb_it resembles kb_judo `` kb_randori '' .in applying kb_a technique during kb_military_education_and_training , kb_it is the responsibility of `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' to prevent kb_injury to `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' by employing kb_a speed and kb_force of kb_application_(computing) that is commensurate with their partner 's proficiency in `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' . kb_injuries ( especially those to the joints ) , when they do occur in aikido , are often the result of `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' misjudging the ability of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' to receive the kb_throw_(grappling) or pin .kb_a kb_science of kb_injuries in the kb_martial_arts kb_arts showed that the kb_type_(biology) of kb_injuries varied considerably from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_art to the kb_other_(philosophy) .kb_hardness kb_tissue_(biology) kb_injuries are kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the most common types of kb_injuries found within aikido , as kb_water_well as joint kb_strain_(biology) and stubbed fingers and toes . several kb_maternal_death from head-and-neck kb_injuries , caused by aggressive `` shihōnage '' in kb_a kb_senpai_and_kōhaiaikido practitioners ( commonly called `` aikidōka '' outside kb_japan ) generally progress by promotion through kb_a series of `` kb_grade_(education) '' ( `` kb_kyū '' ) , followed by kb_a series of `` kb_degree_(angle) '' ( `` kb_dan_(rank) '' ) , pursuant to formal testing procedures . some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners ' kb_grade_(education) , often simply kb_white_american and kb_black_belt_(martial_arts) to distinguish `` kyu '' and `` kb_dan_(rank) '' kb_grade_(education) , though some use various belt colors . testing kb_requirement_analysis vary , kb_sulfate kb_a kb_particular rank in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another . some dojos do not allow students to kb_take the test to obtain kb_a `` kb_dan_(rank) '' rank unless they are 16 or older .the uniform worn for practicing aikido ( `` kb_aikidogi '' ) is similar to the kb_military_education_and_training uniform ( `` kb_keikogi '' ) used in most kb_other_(philosophy) kb_modern_history kb_martial_arts kb_arts ; kb_simple_polygon trousers and kb_a wraparound jacket , usually kb_white_american . both thick ( `` judo-style '' ) , and thin ( `` karate-style '' ) kb_cotton tops are used . aikido-specific tops are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance with shorter sleeves which reach to just kb_#ecclesiastical_history the kb_elbow_river .most aikido kb_systems_analysis add kb_a pair of wide pleated kb_black_sea or kb_indigo trousers called kb_a `` kb_hakama '' ( used also in kb_naginatajutsu , kb_kendo , and kb_iaido ) . in many schools , its use is reserved for practitioners with ( `` kb_dan_(rank) '' ) ranks or for instructors , while others allow all practitioners to wear kb_a `` kb_hakama '' regardless of rank .the most common criticism of aikido is that kb_it suffers from kb_a lack of kb_metaphysical_realism in kb_military_education_and_training . the attacks initiated by `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' ( and which `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' must defend against ) have been criticized as kb_being `` weak '' , `` sloppy '' , and `` little more than caricatures of an attack '' .weak attacks from `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' allow for kb_a conditioned response from `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners . to counteract this , some kb_art_movement allow students to become less compliant over kb_time_(magazine) but , in keeping with the core philosophies , this is after having demonstrated proficiency in kb_being able to protect themselves and their kb_military_education_and_training partners . kb_shodokan_aikido aikido addresses the issue by practising in kb_a competitive kb_text_formatting . such adaptations are debated between kb_art_movement , with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified , or that they are not kb_military_education_and_training for self-defense or kb_combat_(newspaper) effectiveness , but kb_spirituality , kb_fitness_(biology) or kb_other_(philosophy) reasons .another criticism pertains to the kb_shift_code in kb_military_education_and_training focus after the end of ueshiba 's seclusion in iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s , as kb_he_(letter) increasingly emphasized the kb_spirituality and kb_philosophy aspects of aikido . as kb_a result , strikes to kb_pressure_point points by `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , entering ( `` kb_irimi '' ) and initiation of techniques by `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , the distinction between `` omote '' ( front side ) and `` ura '' ( back side ) techniques , and the use of weapons , were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice . some aikido practitioners kb_sentience that lack of kb_military_education_and_training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness .conversely , some kb_art_movement of aikido receive criticism for not placing enough importance on the kb_spirituality practices emphasized by ueshiba . according to minoru shibata of aikido kb_academic_journal , `` o-sensei 's aikido was not kb_a continuation and kb_extension_(kinesiology) of the kb_old_testament and has kb_a distinct discontinuity with kb_past martial and kb_philosophy concepts . '' that is , that aikido practitioners kb_world_health_organization focus on aikido 's kb_semitic_root in traditional `` kb_jujutsu '' or `` kb_kenjutsucategory : kb_japanese_language kb_martial_arts kb_artscategory : dōcategory : kb_article_(grammar) containing kb_video kb_clips_(software)kb_art is kb_a diverse range of kb_human_behavior in creating visual , auditory or performing kb_artifact_(archaeology) ( kb_artworks ) , expressing the author 's kb_imagination , kb_concept kb_idea , or technical skill , kb_intention to kb_beryllium appreciated for their kb_beauty or emotional kb_power_(physics) . in their most kb_general_(united_states) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism these activities include the production of works of kb_art , the criticism of kb_art , the kb_science of the kb_history of kb_art , and the kb_aesthetic dissemination of kb_art .the kb_triliteral kb_classical_conditioning kb_branches_of_science of kb_art are kb_painting , kb_sculpture and kb_architecture . kb_music , kb_theatre , kb_film , kb_dance , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_performing_arts kb_arts , as kb_water_well as kb_ancient_egyptian_literature and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_medes such as kb_interactive_media kb_medes , are included in kb_a broader kb_definition of kb_the_arts kb_arts . until the 17th century , `` kb_art '' referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or kb_sciences . in kb_modern_history usage after the 17th century , where kb_aesthetic considerations are paramount , the kb_fine_(penalty) kb_arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in kb_general_(united_states) , such as the kb_decorative_art or kb_applied_arts .though the kb_definition of what constitutes kb_art is disputed and has changed over kb_time_(magazine) , kb_general_(united_states) descriptions mention an idea of kb_imagination or technical skill stemming from kb_agency_(philosophy) and creation . the kb_nature of kb_art and related concepts , such as creativity and kb_interpretation_(logic) , are explored in kb_a branch of kb_philosophy known as kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics .in the perspective of the kb_history of kb_art , artistic works have existed for almost as kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) as humankind : from early kb_pre-historic_art kb_art to contemporary kb_art ; however , some kb_theories restrict the kb_concept of `` artistic works '' to kb_modern_history kb_western_esotericism kb_society . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) early kb_word_sense of the kb_definition of `` kb_art '' is closely related to the older kb_latin kb_meaning_(linguistics) , which roughly translates to `` skill '' or `` kb_craft , '' as associated with kb_lexical_semantics such as `` kb_artisan . '' kb_australian_english kb_lexical_semantics kb_derived_trait from this kb_meaning_(linguistics) include `` artifact '' , `` artificial '' , `` artifice '' , `` kb_medical_abortion kb_arts '' , and `` kb_military kb_arts '' . however , there are many kb_other_(philosophy) colloquial uses of kb_the_word_(free_love) word , all with some relation to its kb_etymologyover kb_time_(magazine) , kb_philosopher like kb_plato , kb_aristotle , kb_socrates and kb_immanuel_kant , among others , questioned the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of kb_art . several dialogues in kb_plato tackle questions about kb_art : kb_socrates says that kb_poetry is inspired by the kb_muses , and is not kb_rational_number . kb_he_(letter) speaks approvingly of this , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_theory_of_forms of kb_divinity madness ( drunkenness , eroticism , and dreaming ) in the `` kb_phaedrus_(plato) `` ( 265a–c ) , and yet in the `` '' kb_republic '' '' wants to kb_outlaw kb_homer 's great kb_poetic_edda kb_art , and laughter as kb_water_well . in `` kb_ion '' , kb_socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of kb_homer that kb_he_(letter) expresses in the `` kb_republic '' . the kb_dialogue `` kb_ion '' suggests that kb_homer 's `` kb_iliad '' functioned in the kb_ancient_greek kb_world as the kb_bible does today in the kb_modern_history kb_christianity kb_world : as divinely inspired literary kb_art that can provide kb_morality guidance , if only kb_it can kb_beryllium properly interpreted .with regards to the literary kb_art and the musical kb_arts , kb_aristotle considered kb_epic_poetry , tragedy , comedy , kb_dithyramb kb_poetry and kb_music to kb_beryllium kb_mimesis or imitative kb_art , each varying in imitation by kb_list_of_art_mediums , kb_space_debris , and manner . for example , kb_music imitates with the kb_medes of kb_rhythm and kb_harmony , whereas kb_dance imitates with kb_rhythm alone , and kb_poetry with kb_language . the kb_theory_of_forms also differ in their kb_space_debris of imitation . comedy , for instance , is kb_a dramatic imitation of men worse than average ; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average . lastly , the kb_theory_of_forms differ in their manner of imitation—through kb_narrative or kb_character_(computing) , through change or no change , and through drama or no drama . kb_aristotle believed that imitation is kb_natural_number to mankind and constitutes kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of mankind 's advantages over kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing .the kb_second , and more recent , kb_word_sense of kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_art '' as an abbreviation for `` kb_creativity kb_art '' or `` kb_fine_art '' kb_declaration_of_independence_of_albania in the early 17th century . kb_fine_art refers to kb_a skill used to express the kb_artist 's creativity , or to engage the audience 's kb_aesthetic sensibilities , or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or `` finer '' kb_cold_working of kb_art .within this latter kb_word_sense , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_art '' may refer to several things : ( kb_iodine ) kb_a kb_science of kb_a kb_creativity skill , ( ii ) kb_a process of using the kb_creativity skill , ( iii ) kb_a kb_decay_product of the kb_creativity skill , or ( iv ) the audience 's experience with the kb_creativity skill . the kb_creativity kb_arts ( `` kb_art '' as discipline ) are kb_a kb_class_(set_theory) of disciplines which produce `` kb_artworks '' ( `` kb_art '' as kb_object_relations_theory ) that are compelled by kb_a kb_personal_property drive ( kb_art as activity ) and convey kb_a message , mood , or kb_symbolism_(arts) for the perceiver to interpret ( kb_art as experience ) . kb_art is something that stimulates an kb_individual 's thoughts , emotions , kb_orthodoxy , or kb_idea through the senses . works of kb_art can kb_beryllium explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of images or kb_object_relations_theory . for some scholars , such as kb_immanuel_kant , the kb_sciences and kb_the_arts kb_arts could kb_beryllium distinguished by taking kb_science as representing the domain of kb_knowledge_representation and kb_the_arts kb_arts as representing the domain of the kb_freedom of artistic expression .often , if the skill is kb_being used in kb_a common or practical way , kb_people_(american_magazine) kb_will_and_testament consider kb_it kb_a kb_craft instead of kb_art . likewise , if the skill is kb_being used in kb_a commercial or industrial way , kb_it may kb_beryllium considered kb_commercial_art kb_art instead of kb_fine_art . on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , crafts and design are sometimes considered kb_applied_art . some kb_art followers have argued that the difference between kb_fine_art and kb_applied_art has more to do with kb_lightness judgments made about the kb_art than any clear definitional difference . however , even kb_fine_art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression . the purpose of works of kb_art may kb_beryllium to communicate kb_idea , such as in kb_politics_of_albania , spiritually , or philosophically motivated kb_art ; to create kb_a kb_word_sense of kb_beauty ( kb_episcopal_see kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics ) ; to explore the kb_nature of kb_machine_perception ; for kb_pleasure ; or to generate kb_strong_nuclear_force emotions . the purpose may also kb_beryllium seemingly nonexistent .the kb_nature of kb_art has been described by kb_philosophy kb_richard_wollheim wollheim as `` kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the most elusive of the traditional kb_problems_(aristotle) of kb_human kb_albanian_culture '' . kb_art has been kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as kb_a kb_space_vehicle for the expression or kb_communication of emotions and kb_idea , kb_a means for kb_exploring and appreciating kb_formalism_(art) kb_chemical_element for their own sake , and as `` kb_mimesis '' or kb_representation_(arts) . kb_art as kb_mimesis has deep kb_semitic_root in the kb_philosophy of kb_aristotle . kb_leo_tolstoy tolstoy kb_interpretatio_graeca kb_art as kb_a use of indirect means to communicate from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_person to another . kb_benedetto_croce croce and r.g . collingwood advanced the kb_idealism view that kb_art expresses emotions , and that the kb_cold_working of kb_art therefore essentially exists in the kb_mind of the creator . the kb_theory of kb_art as kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism has its kb_semitic_root in the kb_philosophy of kb_immanuel_kant , and was kb_adaptation in the early twentieth century by kb_roger_fry fry and kb_clive_bell kb_bell . more recently , thinkers influenced by kb_martin_heidegger heidegger have interpreted kb_art as the means by which kb_a kb_community develops for itself kb_a kb_list_of_art_mediums for self-expression and kb_interpretation_(logic) . kb_george_dickie_(philosopher) has offered an kb_institutional_theory_of_art kb_theory of kb_art that defines kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art as any artifact upon which kb_a qualified kb_grammatical_person or persons acting on behalf of the kb_social_anarchism institution commonly referred to as `` the kb_art_world '' has conferred `` the status of candidate for appreciation '' . larry shiner has described kb_fine_art as `` not an kb_essence or kb_a fate but something we have made . kb_art as we have generally understood kb_it is kb_a kb_european_eel invention barely kb_2_(number) hundred years kb_old_testament . ''kb_art may kb_beryllium characterized in terms of kb_mimesis ( its kb_representation_(arts) of kb_reality ) , kb_narrative ( storytelling ) , expression , kb_communication of kb_emotion , or

kb_object_relations_theory in fields including today kb_painting , kb_sculpture , kb_printmaking , photography , and kb_other_(philosophy) visual kb_medes . sculptures , kb_cave_paintings paintings , kb_rock_of_gibraltar paintings and kb_petroglyphs from the kb_upper_paleolithic dating to roughly 40,000 years ago have been found , but the precise kb_meaning_(linguistics) of such kb_art is often disputed because kb_sulfate little is known about the cultures that produced them . the oldest kb_art kb_object_relations_theory in the world—a series of tiny , drilled kb_snail kb_electron_shells about 75,000 years old—were discovered in kb_a kb_southern_africa kb_african_plate cave . containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100,000 years . etched

civilizations , more of their kb_art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to kb_other_(philosophy) cultures and later times . some also have provided the kb_first_trimester kb_record_(computer_science) of how artists worked . for example , this period of kb_ancient_greek kb_art saw kb_a veneration of the kb_human kb_health kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism and the development of kb_cognate skills to show musculature , poise , kb_beauty , and anatomically correct proportions .in kb_byzantine_empire and

, kb_calligraphy , and kb_architecture . further kb_east_africa , kb_religion dominated artistic kb_art_movement and kb_theory_of_forms too . kb_indian_subcontinent and tibet saw kb_emphasis_(typography) on painted sculptures and kb_dance , while kb_religion kb_painting kb_loanword many conventions from kb_sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with kb_emphasis_(typography) on outlines . kb_china saw the flourishing of many kb_art kb_theory_of_forms : jade carving , bronzework , kb_ancient_egyptian_pottery ( including the stunning kb_terracotta_army of kb_byzantine_emperors qin ) , kb_poetry , kb_calligraphy , kb_music , kb_painting , drama , kb_artificial_intelligence_in_fiction , etc . kb_chinese_characters kb_art_movement vary greatly from era to era and each kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) is traditionally kb_english_alphabet#letter_names after the ruling kb_dynasty . kb_sulfate , for example , kb_tang_dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse , emphasizing idealized landscapes , but kb_ming_dynasty kb_dynasty paintings are busy and colorful , and focus on telling stories via setting and kb_function_composition . kb_japan names its kb_art_movement after kb_ottoman_empire dynasties too , and also saw much interplay between the kb_art_movement of kb_calligraphy and kb_painting . kb_woodblock_printing printingthe kb_western_esotericism kb_age_of_enlightenment of kb_age_of_enlightenment in the kb_18th_century century saw artistic depictions of kb_health and kb_rational_number certainties of the clockwork kb_universe , as kb_water_well as kb_politics_of_albania revolutionary visions of kb_a post-monarchist kb_world , such as kb_william_blake 's portrayal of kb_newton,_south_australia as kb_a kb_divinity geometer , or kb_jacques-louis_david 's propagandistic paintings . this kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_romanticism rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans , exemplified in the kb_novels of kb_goethe . the late kb_rilindja_kombëtare century then saw kb_a host of artistic movements , such as kb_academic_art kb_art , kb_symbolism_(arts) , kb_impressionism and kb_fauvism among others .the kb_history of twentieth-century kb_art is kb_a kb_narrative of endless possibilities and the search for kb_new_world kb_corporate_social_responsibility , each kb_being torn down in succession by the kb_next . thus the parameters of kb_impressionism , kb_expressionism , kb_fauvism , kb_cubism , kb_dadaism , kb_surrealism , etc . can not kb_beryllium maintained very much beyond the kb_time_(magazine) of their invention . increasing kb_globalization kb_interaction during this kb_time_(magazine) saw an kb_cognate influence of kb_other_(philosophy) cultures into kb_art_of_europe . thus , kb_japanese_language woodblock prints ( themselves influenced by kb_western_esotericism kb_renaissance draftsmanship ) had an immense influence on kb_impressionism and subsequent development . later , kb_african_art were taken up by picasso and to some extent by kb_matisse . similarly , in the 19th and 20th kb_century_(cricket) the kb_western_culture has had huge impacts on kb_eastern_hemisphere kb_art with originally kb_western_esotericism kb_idea like kb_communism and kb_post-modernism exerting kb_a powerful influence .kb_modernism , the idealistic search for kb_truth , gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to kb_a realization of its unattainability . kb_theodor_w._adorno w. adorno said in 1970 , `` kb_it is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns kb_art can kb_beryllium taken for granted any more : neither kb_art itself , nor kb_art in relationship to the whole , nor even the kb_right-wing_politics of kb_art to exist . '' kb_relativism was kb_acceptance#self_acceptance as an unavoidable kb_truth , which kb_light-emitting_diode to the period of contemporary kb_art and kb_list_of_postmodern_critics criticism , where cultures of the kb_world and of kb_history are seen as changing kb_theory_of_forms , which can kb_beryllium appreciated and kb_drawing_(metalworking) from only with kb_skepticism and irony . furthermore , the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue kb_it is now more appropriate to think in terms of kb_a kb_globalization kb_albanian_culture , rather than of kb_regional_power ones .in `` kb_the_origin_of_the_work_of_art kb_evolution of the kb_cold_working of kb_art '' , kb_martin_heidegger heideggerthe kb_creativity kb_arts are often divided into more specific categories , typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as kb_medes , kb_genre , kb_art_movement , and kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . kb_art kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism refers to the kb_elements_of_art kb_art that are independent of its kb_interpretation_(logic) or kb_importance . kb_it kb_cover_version the methods kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by the kb_artist and the kb_health kb_function_composition of the artwork , primarily non-semantic aspects of the kb_cold_working ( i.e. , kb_figurae ) , such as kb_color , kb_contour_drawing , kb_dimension , kb_list_of_art_mediums , kb_melody , kb_space , kb_texture_(painting) , and kb_lightness . kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism may also include kb_visual_design_elements_and_principles#principles_of_design design principles , such as arrangement , kb_formal_balance , kb_contrast_(vision) , kb_emphasis_(typography) , kb_harmony , kb_hierarchical_proportion , kb_principles_of_grouping , and kb_rhythm .in kb_general_(united_states) there are kb_triliteral schools of kb_philosophy regarding kb_art , focusing respectively on kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , content , and kb_context_(language_use) . extreme kb_formalism_(art) is the view that all kb_aesthetic kb_chemical_property of kb_art are formal ( that is , part of the kb_art kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism ) . kb_philosopher almost kb_universal_reconciliation reject this view and hold that the kb_chemical_property and kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics of kb_art extend beyond materials , techniques , and kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . unfortunately , there is little consensus on terminology for these informal kb_chemical_property . some authors refer to kb_grammatical_subject kb_matter and content – i.e. , denotations and connotations – while others prefer terms like kb_meaning_(linguistics) and kb_importance .extreme intentionalism holds that kb_authorial_intent intent kb_play_(theatre) kb_a decisive role in the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art , conveying the content or kb_essential_element main idea , while all kb_other_(philosophy) interpretations can kb_beryllium discarded . kb_it defines the kb_grammatical_subject as the persons or idea represented , and the content as the kb_artist 's experience of that kb_grammatical_subject . for example , the kb_function_composition of kb_napoleon_i_on_his_imperial_throne on kb_histidine kb_ottoman_empire throne is partly kb_loanword from the kb_statue_of_zeus_at_olympia kb_zeus at kb_olympia_(manet) . as evidenced by the kb_title , the kb_grammatical_subject is kb_napoleon , and the content is kb_jean-auguste-dominique_ingres 's kb_representation_(arts) of kb_napoleon as `` emperor-god beyond kb_time_(magazine) and kb_space '' . similarly to extreme kb_formalism_(art) , kb_philosopher typically reject extreme intentionalism , because kb_art may have kb_cross-platform_software ambiguous meanings and kb_authorial_intent intent may kb_beryllium kb_uncertainty and thus irrelevant . its restrictive kb_interpretation_(logic) is `` socially unhealthy , philosophically unreal , and kb_politics_of_albania unwise '' .finally , the developing kb_theory of kb_post-structuralism studies kb_art 's kb_importance in kb_a kb_cultural_anthropology kb_context_(language_use) , such as the kb_idea , emotions , and reactions prompted by kb_a kb_cold_working . the kb_cultural_anthropology kb_context_(language_use) often kb_redox to the kb_artist 's techniques and intentions , in which case kb_analysis proceeds along lines similar to kb_formalism_(art) and intentionalism . however , in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_noun_case historical and kb_material conditions may predominate , such as kb_religion and kb_philosophy convictions , sociopolitical and kb_economic_anthropology kb_structural_analysis , or even kb_climate_of_albania and kb_geography . kb_art_criticismkb_art can connote kb_a kb_word_sense of trained ability or mastery of kb_a kb_list_of_art_mediums . kb_art can also simply refer to the kb_adaptation and efficient use of kb_a kb_language `` kb_art '' , kb_particular in its elevated kb_word_sense , requires kb_a certain level of kb_creativity expertise by the kb_artist , whether this kb_beryllium kb_a demonstration of technical ability , an originality in stylistic approach , or kb_a combination of these kb_2_(number) . traditionally skill of execution was viewed as kb_a quality inseparable from kb_art and thus necessary for its success ; for kb_leonardo_da_vinci da vinci , kb_art , neither more nor less than kb_histidine kb_other_(philosophy) endeavors , was kb_a manifestation of skill . kb_rembrandt 's kb_cold_working , now praised for its ephemeral virtues , was most admired by kb_histidine contemporaries for its virtuosity . at the kb_turn_(geometry) of the 20th century , the adroit performances of kb_john_singer_sargent sargent were alternately admired and viewed with kb_skepticism for their kb_manual_(music) kb_fluency , yet at nearly the same kb_time_(magazine) the kb_artist kb_world_health_organization would become the era 's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast , kb_pablo_picasso picassokb_a common contemporary criticism of some kb_modern_art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic kb_space_debris . in kb_conceptual_art , kb_marcel_duchamp kb_duchamp 's `` kb_fountain_(duchamp) '' is among the kb_first_trimester examples of pieces wherein the kb_artist used kb_found_art kb_object_relations_theory ( `` ready-made '' ) and exercised no traditionally recognised kb_set_(mythology) of skills . kb_tracey_emin kb_tracey_emin 's `` my bed '' , or kb_damien_hirst kb_damien_hirstsince kb_history_of_abortion , much of the finest kb_art has represented kb_a deliberate kb_computer_monitor of wealth or kb_power_(physics) , often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials . much kb_art has been commissioned by kb_politics rulers or kb_religion establishments , with more modest versions only kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance to the most wealthy in society .nevertheless , there have been many periods where kb_art of very kb_high_middle_ages quality was kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance , in terms of kb_ownership , across kb_prespa_lake parts of society , above all in cheap kb_medes such as kb_ancient_egyptian_pottery , which persists in the ground , and perishable kb_medes such as kb_textile_industry and kb_wood . in many different cultures , the kb_ceramics_of_indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas of kb_indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas of the kb_americas are found in such kb_a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to kb_a kb_social_elite , though kb_other_(philosophy) kb_theory_of_forms of kb_art may have been . reproductive methods such as kb_molding_(process) made mass-production easier , and were used to bring high-quality kb_ancient_roman_pottery kb_ancient_egyptian_pottery and kb_ancient_greek tanagra figurines to kb_a very wide market . kb_cylinder_seals were both artistic and practical , and very widely used by what can kb_beryllium loosely called the middle kb_class_(biology) in the kb_ancient_near_east kb_east_africa . once kb_ancient_roman_coinage were widely used , these also became an kb_art kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism that reached the widest range of society .another important kb_list_of_azerbaijani_inventions_and_discoveries came in the 15th century in kb_europe , when kb_printmaking began with small woodcuts , mostly kb_religion , that were often very small and hand-colored , and affordable even by peasants kb_world_health_organization glued them to the walls of their homes . printed books were initially very expensive , but fell steadily in kb_price until by the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations . kb_popular_prints prints of many different sorts have decorated homes and kb_other_(philosophy) places for kb_century_(cricket) .kb_public_art and monuments , kb_secular and kb_religion , by their kb_nature normally address the whole of society , and visitors as viewers , and kb_computer_monitor to the kb_general_(united_states) kb_state_school has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) been an important kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors in their design . kb_egyptian_temples are typical in that the most kb_largest_organisms and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could kb_beryllium seen by the kb_general_(united_states) kb_state_school , rather than the areas seen only by the kb_priests . many areas of royal palaces , castles and the houses of the kb_social_elite were often generally accessible , and kb_prespa_lake parts of the kb_art collections of such kb_people_(american_magazine) could often kb_beryllium seen , either by anybody , or by those able to pay kb_a small kb_price , or those wearing the correct clothes , regardless of kb_world_health_organization they were , as at the kb_palace_of_versailles of versailles , where the appropriate kb_extra_(australian_tv_channel) accessories ( kb_silver shoe buckles and kb_a kb_sword ) could kb_beryllium hired from shops outside .special arrangements were made to allow the kb_state_school to kb_episcopal_see many royal or kb_private_aviation collections placed in kb_art_gallery , as with the kb_orleans_collection#collection_in_paris kb_class_(set_theory) mostly housed in kb_a kb_wing of the kb_palais_royal royal in kb_paris , which could kb_beryllium visited for most of the kb_18th_century century . in kb_italy the kb_art kb_tourism_in_angola of the kb_grand_tour tour became kb_a kb_major_(united_states) kb_industry from the kb_renaissance onwards , and governments and cities made efforts to make their kb_key_(cryptography) works accessible . the kb_kingdom_of_great_britain kb_royal_collection kb_class_(set_theory) remains distinct , but kb_prespa_lake donations such as the kb_old_royal_library library were made from kb_it to kb_british_museum kb_british_museum , established in 1753. the kb_uffizi in kb_florence opened entirely as kb_a gallery in 1765 , though this kb_function_(biology) had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants ' offices for kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_time_(magazine) before . the building now kb_dutch_loango-angola by the kb_prado in kb_madrid was built before the kb_french_revolution for the kb_state_school kb_computer_monitor of parts of the royal kb_art kb_class_(set_theory) , and similar royal kb_art_gallery kb_open_standard to the kb_state_school existed in kb_vienna , kb_munich and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_capital_(architecture) . the opening of the kb_musée_du_louvre du louvre during the kb_french_revolution ( in 1793 ) as kb_a kb_state_school kb_museum for much of the former kb_france kb_royal_collection kb_class_(set_theory) certainly marked an important stage in the development of kb_state_school access to kb_art , transferring kb_ownership to kb_a kb_roman_republic kb_state_of_matter , but was kb_a continuation of trends already kb_water_well established .most kb_modern_history kb_state_school museums and kb_visual_arts_education programs for children in schools can kb_beryllium traced back to this impulse to have kb_art kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance to everyone . museums in the united kb_sovereign_state tend to kb_beryllium gifts from the very rich to the masses . ( kb_the_metropolitan_museum_of_art kb_metropolitan_museum_of_art of kb_art in kb_new_york_city , for example , was created by kb_john_taylor_johnston johnstonthere have been attempts by artists to create kb_art that can not kb_beryllium bought by the wealthy as kb_a status kb_space_debris . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_prime_(symbol) original motivators of much of the kb_art of the late kb_1960s_in_the_united_states and 1970s was to create kb_art that could not kb_beryllium bought and sold . kb_it is `` necessary to present something more than mere kb_object_relations_theory '' said the kb_major_(united_states) post kb_war kb_german_language kb_artist joseph beuys . this kb_time_(magazine) period saw the rise of such things as kb_performance_art kb_art , kb_video_art , and kb_conceptual_artkb_art has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) been controversial , that is to say disliked by some viewers , for kb_a wide kb_variety_(magazine) of reasons , though most pre-modern kb_controversies_in_autism are dimly recorded , or completely kb_lost_film to kb_a kb_modern_history view . kb_iconoclasm is the destruction of kb_art that is disliked for kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of reasons , including kb_religion ones . kb_aniconism is kb_a kb_general_(united_states) dislike of either all figurative images , or often just kb_religion ones , and has been kb_a thread in many kb_major_religious_groups . kb_it has been kb_a crucial kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors in the kb_history of kb_islamic_art kb_art , where kb_depictions_of_muhammad of kb_muhammad remain especially controversial . much kb_art has been disliked purely because kb_it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers , parties or kb_other_(philosophy) kb_group_(mathematics) . artistic conventions have often been kb_conservative and taken very seriously by kb_art kb_art_critic , though often much less kb_sulfate by kb_a wider kb_state_school . the kb_iconography content of kb_art could cause kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war , as with late kb_medieval_greek depictions of the kb_new_world kb_motif_(visual_arts) of the kb_swoon_of_the_virgin of the virgin in scenes of the kb_crucifixion_of_jesus of kb_jesus . the `` last kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition '' by kb_michelangelo was controversial for various reasons , including breaches of kb_decorum through nudity and the apollo-like pose of kb_jesus_christ .the content of much formal kb_art through kb_history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the kb_artist , but with the kb_advent of kb_romanticism , and kb_economic_anthropology changes in the production of kb_art , the artists ' kb_computer_vision became the usual kb_determinant of the content of kb_histidine kb_art , increasing the incidence of kb_controversies_in_autism , though often kb_redox their kb_importance . kb_strong_nuclear_force incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to kb_court kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war . kb_théodore_géricault géricault 's `` kb_the_raft_of_the_medusa of the kb_medusa '' ( kb_circa 1820 ) , was in part kb_a kb_politics commentary on kb_a recent event . kb_édouard_manet manet 's `` kb_the_luncheon_on_the_grass déjeuner sur l'herbe '' ( 1863 ) , was considered scandalous not because of the kb_nude woman , but because she is seated kb_next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the kb_time_(magazine) , rather than in robes of the antique kb_world . kb_john_singer_sargent sargent 's `` madame pierre gautreau ( madam x ) '' ( 1884 ) , caused kb_a kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war over the reddish pink used to kb_color the woman 's kb_ear lobe , considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high-society kb_rutherford_model 's reputation .the gradual abandonment of kb_realism_(arts) and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual kb_appearance_(philosophy) of kb_british_subject in the 19th and 20th kb_century_(cricket) kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_a rolling kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war lasting for over kb_a century . in the twentieth century , kb_pablo_picasso picasso 's `` kb_guernica_(painting) '' ( 1937 ) used arresting kb_cubism techniques and stark kb_monochrome_painting kb_cooking_oil , to depict the harrowing consequences of kb_a contemporary bombing of kb_a small , kb_ancient_history kb_basque_language town . kb_leon_golub golub 's `` interrogation iii '' ( 1981 ) , depicts kb_a female kb_nude , hooded detainee strapped to kb_a chair , her kb_human_leg kb_open_standard to reveal her sexual kb_organ_(anatomy) , surrounded by kb_2_(number) tormentors dressed in everyday clothing . kb_andres_serrano serrano 's `` kb_piss_christ kb_jesus_christ '' ( 1989 ) is kb_a photograph of kb_a crucifix , kb_sacred_architecture to the kb_christianity kb_religion and representing kb_jesus_christ 's kb_sacrifice and final suffering , submerged in kb_a kb_glass of the kb_artist 's own urine . the resulting uproar kb_light-emitting_diode to comments in the kb_united_states_senate kb_sovereign_state kb_united_states_senate about kb_state_school funding of kb_the_arts kb_arts .before kb_modernism , kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics in kb_art_of_europe was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate kb_formal_balance between different aspects of kb_realism_(arts) kb_truth to kb_nature and the kb_ideal_(ring_theory) ; kb_idea as to what the appropriate kb_formal_balance is have shifted to and fro over the kb_century_(cricket) . this concern is largely absent in kb_other_(philosophy) traditions of kb_art . the kb_aesthetic theorist kb_john_ruskin , kb_world_health_organization championed what kb_he_(letter) saw as the kb_realism_(arts) of j. m. w. kb_j._m._w._turner , saw kb_art 's role as the kb_communication by artifice of an kb_essential_element kb_truth that could only kb_beryllium found in kb_nature .the kb_definition and evaluation of kb_art has become especially problematic since the 20th century . kb_richard_wollheim wollheim distinguishes kb_triliteral approaches to assessing the kb_aesthetic kb_lightness of kb_art : the kb_mathematical_realism , whereby kb_aesthetic quality is an kb_absolute_value independent of any kb_human view ; the kb_objectivity_(philosophy) , whereby kb_it is also an kb_absolute_value , but is dependent on kb_general_(united_states) kb_human experience ; and the kb_relativist kb_positional_notationthe kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_modernism in the late nineteenth century kb_lead to kb_a kb_political_radicalism break in the kb_human_fertilization of the kb_function_(biology) of kb_art , and then again in the late twentieth century with the kb_advent of kb_postmodern_art . kb_clement_greenberg greenberg 's kb_u.s._presidential_election,_1960 article `` modernist kb_painting '' defines kb_modern_art as `` the use of kb_characteristic_(algebra) methods of kb_a discipline to criticize the discipline itself '' . greenberg originally kb_applied_science this idea to the abstract kb_german_expressionism kb_movement_(sign_language) and used kb_it as kb_a way to kb_natural_language_understanding and justify flat ( non-illusionistic ) abstract kb_painting :pop artists like kb_andy_warhol warhol became both noteworthy and influential through kb_cold_working including and possibly critiquing popular kb_albanian_culture , as kb_water_well as the kb_art_world . artists of the 1980s , 1990s , and kb_2000s_in_angola expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond `` kb_high_middle_ages kb_art '' to all kb_cultural_anthropology image-making , including fashion images , comics , billboards and pornography .kb_duchamp once kb_anatolian_hypothesis that kb_art is any activity of any kind- everything . however , the way that only certain activities are classified today as kb_art is kb_a kb_social_anarchism kb_construction . there is kb_evidence_(law) that there may kb_beryllium an kb_chemical_element of kb_truth to this . `` the invention of kb_art : kb_a kb_cultural_anthropology kb_history '' is an kb_art_history book which examines the kb_construction of the kb_modern_history system of kb_the_arts kb_arts i.e . kb_fine_art . shiner finds kb_evidence_(law) that the older system of kb_the_arts kb_arts before our kb_modern_history system ( kb_fine_art ) held kb_art to kb_beryllium any skilled kb_human activity i.e . kb_ancient_greek society did not possess the kb_terminology kb_art but kb_techne . kb_techne can kb_beryllium understood neither as kb_art or kb_craft , the kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving kb_being that the kb_aspect_ratio_(image)#distinctions of kb_art and kb_craft are historical products that came later on in kb_human kb_history . kb_techne included kb_painting , sculpting and kb_music but also ; cooking , kb_medicine , kb_horsemanship , kb_geometry , kb_carpentry , kb_prophecy , and farming etc .following kb_duchamp during the kb_first_trimester half of the twentieth century , kb_a significant kb_shift_code to kb_general_(united_states) kb_aesthetic kb_theory took kb_place_of_articulation which attempted to apply kb_aesthetic kb_theory between various kb_theory_of_forms of kb_art , including the literary kb_arts and the kb_visual_arts kb_arts , to each kb_other_(philosophy) . this resulted in the rise of kb_the_new_criticism kb_new_criticism kb_school and kb_abortion_debate concerning `` kb_intentional_fallacy intentional fallacy '' . at issue was the kb_question of whether the kb_aesthetic intentions of the kb_artist in creating the kb_cold_working of kb_art , whatever its specific kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , should kb_beryllium associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final kb_decay_product of the kb_cold_working of kb_art , or , if the kb_cold_working of kb_art should kb_beryllium evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the kb_artist .in 1946 , kb_w._k._wimsatt k. wimsatt and kb_monroe_beardsley beardsley published kb_a classic and controversial kb_new_world critical essay entitled `` kb_intentional_fallacy intentional fallacy '' , in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author 's intention , or `` kb_intention kb_meaning_(linguistics) '' in the kb_analysis of kb_a literary kb_cold_working . for wimsatt and beardsley , the kb_lexical_semantics on the page were all that mattered ; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant , and potentially distracting .in another essay , `` kb_affective_fallacy affective fallacy , '' which served as kb_a kind of sister essay to `` kb_intentional_fallacy intentional fallacy '' wimsatt and beardsley also discounted the kb_reader_(academic_rank) 's personal/emotional reaction to kb_a literary kb_cold_working as kb_a valid means of analyzing kb_a text . this fallacy would later kb_beryllium repudiated by theorists from the kb_reader-response kb_school of literary kb_theory . ironically , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the leading theorists from this kb_school , kb_stanley_fish kb_fish , was himself trained by kb_new_world kb_art_critic . kb_fish criticizes wimsatt and beardsley in kb_histidine essay `` kb_ancient_egyptian_literature in the kb_reader_(academic_rank) '' ( 1970 ) .as summarized by gaut and livingston in their essay `` the creation of kb_art '' : `` kb_structuralism and post-structuralists theorists and kb_art_critic were sharply critical of many aspects of kb_new_criticism , beginning with the kb_emphasis_(typography) on kb_aesthetic appreciation and the so-called kb_self-governance of kb_art , but they reiterated the attack on kb_biographical_film criticisms 's assumption that the kb_artist 's activities and experience were kb_a privileged critical kb_topic_(linguistics) . '' these authors contend that : `` anti-intentionalists , such as formalists , hold that the intentions involved in the making of kb_art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting kb_art . kb_sulfate details of the act of creating kb_a kb_cold_working , though possibly of kb_interest in themselves , have no bearing on the correct kb_interpretation_(logic) of the kb_cold_working . ''gaut and livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that : `` intentionalists , unlike formalists , hold that reference to intentions is kb_essential_element in fixing the correct kb_interpretation_(logic) of works .

of skill of the deceiver is praised ) . kb_it is this use of kb_the_word_(free_love) word as kb_a kb_measure_(mathematics) of kb_high_middle_ages quality and kb_high_middle_ages kb_lightness that gives the kb_terminology its kb_flavor of subjectivity . making judgments of kb_lightness requires kb_a kb_basis_(linear_algebra) for criticism . at the simplest level , kb_a way to determine whether the impact of the kb_space_debris on the senses meets the criteria to kb_beryllium considered `` kb_art '' is whether kb_it is perceived to kb_beryllium attractive or repulsive . though kb_machine_perception is always colored by experience , and is necessarily subjective , kb_it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying can not kb_beryllium kb_art . however , `` good '' kb_art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to kb_a majority of viewers . in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_lexical_semantics , an kb_artist 's kb_prime_(symbol) kb_motivation need not kb_beryllium the pursuit of the kb_aesthetic . also , kb_art often depicts terrible images made for kb_social_anarchism , kb_morality , or thought-provoking reasons . for example , kb_francisco_goya goya 's kb_painting depicting the kb_spanish_empire shootings of 3rd of may 1808 is kb_a graphic depiction of kb_a firing squad executing several kb_pleading kb_civilian_casualties . yet at the same kb_time_(magazine) , the horrific kb_imagery demonstrates goya 's keen artistic ability in kb_function_composition and execution and produces fitting kb_social_anarchism and kb_politics outrage . thus , the kb_abortion_debate continues as to what kb_musical_mode of kb_aesthetic satisfaction , if any , is required to define 'art ' .the assumption of kb_new_world values or the rebellion against kb_acceptance#self_acceptance notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with kb_a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing . indeed , the kb_obverse_and_reverse is often kb_truth , that the revision of what is kb_folk_etymology conceived of as kb_being aesthetically appealing allows for kb_a re-invigoration of kb_aesthetic sensibility , and kb_a kb_new_world appreciation for the kb_corporate_social_responsibility of kb_art itself . countless schools have kb_anatolian_hypothesis their own ways to define quality , yet they all seem to agree in at least kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) point : once their kb_aesthetic choices are kb_acceptance#self_acceptance , the kb_lightness of the kb_cold_working of kb_art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen kb_list_of_art_mediums to kb_strike_action some kb_universal_studios chord by the rarity of the skill of the kb_artist or in its accurate kb_reflection_(physics) in what is termed the `` kb_zeitgeist '' . kb_art is often kb_intention to kb_appeal to and connect with kb_human kb_emotion . kb_it can arouse

weeks ' kb_gestation , kb_suction-aspiration_abortion or kb_vacuum_aspiration are the most common surgical methods of kb_#induced kb_abortion . `` kb_manual_(music) kb_vacuum_aspiration '' ( mva ) consists of removing the kb_fetus or kb_embryo , kb_placenta , and membranes by suction using kb_a kb_manual_(music) syringe , while `` electric kb_vacuum_aspiration '' ( eva ) uses an electric pump . these techniques differ in the kb_mechanism_(biology) used to apply suction , in how early in kb_pregnancy they can kb_beryllium used , and in whether kb_cervical_dilation is necessary .mva , also known as `` mini-suction '' and `` kb_menstrual_extraction extraction '' , can kb_beryllium used in very early kb_pregnancy , and does not require kb_cervical_dilation . kb_dilation_and_curettage and kb_curettage ( d & kb_vitamin_c ) , the kb_second most common method of surgical kb_abortion , is kb_a standard gynecological procedure performed for kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of reasons , including kb_hypothesis of the uterine lining for possible malignancy , investigation of abnormal bleeding , and kb_abortion . kb_curettage refers to cleaning the walls of the kb_uterus with kb_a kb_curette . the kb_world_health_organization organization recommends this procedure , also called `` sharp kb_curettage , '' only when mva is unavailable .from the 15th kb_gestational_age of kb_gestation until approximately the 26th , kb_other_(philosophy) techniques must kb_beryllium used . kb_dilation_and_evacuation and evacuation ( d & e ) consists of opening the kb_cervix of the kb_uterus and emptying kb_it using surgical instruments and suction . after the 16th kb_gestational_age of kb_gestation , abortions can also kb_beryllium induced by kb_intact_dilation_and_extraction dilation and extraction ( idx ) ( also called intrauterine cranial decompression ) , which requires surgical decompression of the kb_fetus 's kb_human_head before evacuation . idx is sometimes called `` kb_partial-birth_abortion kb_abortion '' , which has been kb_partial-birth_abortion_ban_act banned in the united kb_sovereign_state .in the kb_ipad_(third_generation) kb_pregnancy#terminology of kb_pregnancy , kb_#induced kb_abortion may kb_beryllium performed surgically by kb_intact_dilation_and_extraction dilation and extraction or by kb_hysterotomy_abortion . kb_hysterotomy_abortion is kb_a procedure similar to kb_a kb_caesarean_section kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) and is performed under kb_general_anesthesia . kb_it requires kb_a smaller incision than kb_a kb_caesarean_section kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) and is used during later stages of kb_pregnancy .first-trimester procedures can generally kb_beryllium performed using kb_local_anesthesia anesthesia , while second-trimester methods may require kb_sedation#levels_of_sedation sedation or kb_general_anesthesia .in places lacking the necessary kb_medical_abortion skill

in kb_medicine . in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , the kb_risk of kb_maternal_death kb_death from kb_abortion is 0.7 per 100,000 procedures , making kb_abortion about kb_boron_group times safer for women than childbirth ( 8.8 kb_maternal_deaths kb_maternal_death per 100,000 live births ) . in the united kb_sovereign_state from 2000 to kb_2009_in_science , kb_abortion had kb_a lower mortality rate than kb_plastic_surgery . the kb_risk of abortion-related mortality increases with kb_gestational_age age , but remains lower than that of childbirth through at least 21 weeks ' kb_gestation . outpatient kb_abortion is as safe and effective from 64 to 70 days ' kb_gestation as kb_it is from 57 to 63 days . kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion is safe and effective for pregnancies kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet than 6 weeks ' kb_gestation .kb_vacuum_aspiration in the kb_first_trimester is the safest method of surgical kb_abortion , and can kb_beryllium performed in kb_a kb_primary_care kb_office , kb_abortion_clinic , or hospital . complications , which are rare , can include kb_uterine_perforation perforation , kb_endometritis kb_infection , and retained products of kb_human_fertilization requiring kb_a kb_second procedure to evacuate . infections account for one-third of abortion-related kb_maternal_death in the united kb_sovereign_state . the rate of complications of kb_vacuum_aspiration kb_abortion in the kb_first_trimester is similar regardless of whether the procedure is performed in kb_a hospital , surgical center , or kb_office . preventive kb_antibiotics ( such as kb_doxycycline or kb_metronidazole ) are typically given before elective kb_abortion , as they are believed to substantially reduce the kb_risk of postoperative uterine kb_infection . the rate of failed procedures does not appear to vary significantly depending on whether the kb_abortion is performed by kb_a kb_physician or kb_a kb_mid-level_practitioner practitioner . complications after second-trimester kb_abortion are similar to those after first-trimester kb_abortion , and depend somewhat on the method chosen . second-trimester abortions are generally well-tolerated .there is little difference in terms of kb_air_safety and kb_efficacy between kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion using kb_a combined regimen of kb_mifepristone and kb_misoprostol and surgical kb_abortion ( kb_vacuum_aspiration ) in early kb_first_trimester abortions up to 9 weeks kb_gestation . kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion using the kb_prostaglandin kb_analog_device kb_misoprostol alone is less effective and more painful than kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion using kb_a combined regimen of kb_mifepristone and kb_misoprostol or surgical kb_abortion .some purported risks of kb_abortion are promoted primarily by anti-abortion kb_group_(mathematics) ,but lack kb_scientific_method support . for example , the kb_question of kb_a link between kb_abortion-breast_cancer_hypothesis and kb_breast_cancer has been investigated extensively . kb_major_(united_states) kb_medical_abortion and kb_scientific_method bodies ( including the kb_world_health_organization organization , kb_national_cancer_institute kb_cancer institute , kb_american_cancer_society society , kb_royal_college_of_obstetricians_and_gynaecologists kb_college of obgyn and kb_american_congress_of_obstetricians_and_gynecologists of obgyn ) have concluded that kb_abortion does not cause kb_breast_cancer .in the kb_past even illegality has not automatically meant that the abortions were unsafe . referring to the kb_usa_davis_cup_team , historian kb_linda_gordon kb_gordon,_scotland kb_sovereign_state : `` in kb_fact , illegal abortions in this kb_country_music have an impressive kb_air_safety record . '' according to kb_rickie_solinger solinger ,authors kb_jerome kb_billy_bates and edward zawadzki describe the case of an illegal abortionist in the kb_eastern_hemisphere kb_usa_davis_cup_team in the early 20th century kb_world_health_organization was proud of having successfully completed 13,844 abortions without any fatality .in 1870s kb_new_york_city the famous abortionist/midwife kb_madame_restell restell ( anna trow lohman ) appears to have kb_lost_film very few women among her more than 100,000 patients—a lower mortality rate than the childbirth mortality rate at the kb_time_(magazine) . in 1936 the prominent professor of obstetrics and gynecology kb_frederick_j._taussig j. taussig wrote that kb_a cause of increasing mortality during the years of illegality in the kb_usa_davis_cup_team was thatkb_electric_current kb_evidence_(law) finds no relationship between most induced abortions and kb_abortion_and_mental_health kb_problems_(aristotle) kb_other_(philosophy) than those expected for any unwanted kb_pregnancy . kb_a report by the kb_american_psychological_association kb_continental_association concluded that kb_a woman 's kb_first_trimester kb_abortion is not kb_a kb_threat to kb_mental_health when carried out in the kb_first_trimester , with such women no more likely to have kb_abortion_and_mental_health kb_problems_(aristotle) than those carrying an unwanted kb_pregnancy to kb_terminology ; the mental-health outcome of kb_a woman 's kb_second or greater kb_abortion is less certain . some older reviews concluded that kb_abortion was associated with an increased kb_risk of kb_psychology kb_problems_(aristotle) ; however , they did not use an appropriate control kb_group_(periodic_table) .although some studies show kb_negative_number mental-health outcomes in women kb_world_health_organization choose abortions after the kb_first_trimester because of fetal abnormalities , more rigorous kb_research would kb_beryllium needed to show this conclusively . some kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_negative_number kb_psychology effects of kb_abortion have been referred to by anti-abortion advocates as kb_a separate condition called `` kb_post-abortion_syndrome syndromewomen seeking an kb_abortion may use unsafe methods , especially when kb_abortion is legally restricted . they may attempt kb_self-induced_abortion kb_abortion or seek the help of kb_a kb_grammatical_person without proper kb_medical_abortion kb_military_education_and_training or facilities . this can kb_lead to severe complications , such as incomplete kb_abortion , kb_sepsis , hemorrhage , and damage to kb_organ_(anatomy) kb_organ_(anatomy) .unsafe abortions are kb_a kb_major_(united_states) cause of kb_injury and kb_death among women worldwide . although kb_big_data are imprecise , kb_it is estimated that approximately 20 million unsafe abortions are performed annually , with 97 % taking kb_place_of_articulation in developing countries . unsafe abortions are believed to result in millions of kb_injuries . estimates of kb_maternal_death vary according to kb_methodology , and have ranged from 37,000 to 70,000 in the kb_past decade ; kb_maternal_death from kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion account for around kb_boron_group % of all kb_maternal_deaths kb_maternal_death . the kb_world_health_organization organization believes that mortality has fallen since the 1990s . to reduce the kb_grammatical_number of unsafe abortions , kb_state_school health organizations have generally advocated emphasizing the kb_edict_of_toleration_by_galerius of kb_abortion , kb_military_education_and_training of kb_medical_abortion personnel , and ensuring access to reproductive-health kb_service_(economics) . in response , opponents of kb_abortion point out that kb_abortion bans in no way kb_affect_(psychology) prenatal care for women kb_world_health_organization choose to carry their kb_fetus to kb_terminology . the kb_dublin kb_united_states_declaration_of_independence on maternal health , signed in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2012 , notes , `` the kb_prohibition of kb_abortion does not kb_affect_(psychology) , in any way , the availability of optimal care to kb_pregnant women . ''kb_a kb_major_(united_states) kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors in whether abortions are performed safely or not is the kb_law standing of kb_abortion . countries with restrictive kb_abortion laws have higher kb_rates_(tax) of kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion and similar overall kb_abortion kb_rates_(tax) compared to those where kb_abortion is kb_law and kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance . for example , the 1996 kb_edict_of_toleration_by_galerius of kb_abortion in kb_south_africa had an immediate kb_positive_number impact on the kb_frequency of abortion-related complications , with abortion-related kb_maternal_death dropping by more than 90 % . similar reductions in kb_maternal_mortality mortality have been observed after kb_other_(philosophy) countries have liberalized their kb_abortion laws , such as kb_romania and kb_nepal . kb_a 2011 kb_science concluded that in the united kb_sovereign_state , some state-level anti-abortion laws are correlated with lower kb_rates_(tax) of kb_abortion in that kb_state_of_matter . the kb_analysis , however , did not kb_take into account kb_air_travel to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_sovereign_state without such laws to obtain an kb_abortion . in kb_addition , kb_a lack of access to effective kb_birth_control contributes to kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion . kb_it has been estimated that the incidence of kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion could kb_beryllium kb_redox by up to 75 % ( from 20 million to 5 million annually ) if kb_modern_history kb_family_planning and maternal health kb_service_(economics) were readily kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance globally . kb_rates_(tax) of such abortions may kb_beryllium difficult to kb_measure_(mathematics) because they can kb_beryllium reported variously as kb_miscarriage , `` induced kb_miscarriage '' , `` menstrual regulation '' , `` mini-abortion '' , and `` regulation of kb_a delayed/suspended menstruation '' .forty percent of the kb_world 's women are able to access therapeutic and elective abortions within gestational limits , while an additional kb_35_arietis percent have access to kb_law kb_abortion if they meet certain kb_health , kb_mental_health , or socioeconomic criteria . while kb_maternal_mortality mortality seldom results from safe abortions , unsafe abortions result in 70,000 kb_maternal_death and 5 million disabilities per year . complications of kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion account for approximately an eighth of kb_maternal_death mortalities worldwide , though this varies by kb_region . kb_secondary_school infertility caused by an kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion kb_affect_(psychology) an estimated 24 million women . the rate of unsafe abortions has increased from 44 % to 49 % between kb_1995_davis_cup and 2008. health kb_education_in_albania , access to kb_family_planning , and improvements in health care during and after kb_abortion have been kb_anatolian_hypothesis to address this phenomenon .although kb_it is very uncommon , women undergoing surgical kb_abortion after kb_18-point_agreement weeks kb_gestation sometimes give birth to kb_a kb_fetus that may survive briefly . kb_fetal_viability kb_terminology survival is possible after 22 weeks .if kb_medical_abortion kb_stick_fighting observe signs of kb_life_(magazine) , they may kb_beryllium required to provide care : emergency kb_medical_care if the child has kb_a good chance of survival and palliative care if not . kb_feticide#use_during_legal_abortion fetal demise ; kb_big_data are kb_interpretatio_graeca as either kb_fetus or newborn . between kb_1999_australian_open and kb_2013_mediterranean_games , in the kb_usa_davis_cup_team , the kb_centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention recorded 531 such kb_maternal_death for newborns , approximately 4 per 100,000 abortions .there are kb_2_(number) commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of kb_abortion :in many places , where kb_abortion is illegal or carries kb_a heavy kb_social_stigma , kb_medical_abortion reporting of kb_abortion is not reliable . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , estimates of the incidence of kb_abortion must kb_beryllium made without determining certainty related to standard kb_error .the kb_grammatical_number of abortions performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in recent years , with 41.6 million having been performed in 2003 and 43.8 million having been performed in 2008. the kb_abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women , though kb_it was 24 per 1000 women for kb_developed_countries and 29 per 1000 women for developing countries . the same kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2012 kb_science indicated that in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 , the estimated kb_abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21 % worldwide , with 26 % in kb_developed_countries and 20 % in developing countries .on average , the incidence of kb_abortion is similar in countries with restrictive kb_abortion laws and those with more kb_liberal_christianity access to kb_abortion . however , restrictive kb_abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely . the kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion rate in developing countries is partly attributable to lack of access to kb_modern_history contraceptives ; according to the kb_guttmacher_institute institute , providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38,000 fewer kb_maternal_death from kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion annually worldwide .the rate of kb_law , kb_#induced kb_abortion varies extensively worldwide . according to the report of employees of kb_guttmacher_institute institute kb_it ranged from 7 per 1000 women ( kb_germany and kb_switzerland ) to 30 per 1000 women ( kb_estonia ) in countries with complete kb_statistics in 2008. the kb_hierarchical_proportion of pregnancies that ended in kb_#induced kb_abortion ranged from about 10 % ( kb_israel , kb_netherlands kb_netherlands and kb_switzerland ) to 30 % ( kb_estonia ) in the same kb_group_(periodic_table) , though kb_it might kb_beryllium as kb_high_middle_ages as 36 % kb_hungarian_revolution_of_1919 kb_hungary and kb_romania , whose kb_statistics were deemed incomplete .an kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) kb_science in kb_2002_australian_open concluded that about half of women having abortions were using kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_birth_control at the kb_time_(magazine) of becoming kb_pregnant . inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms and three-quarters of those using the kb_combined_oral_contraceptive_pill pill ; 42 % of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage . the kb_guttmacher_institute institute estimated that `` most abortions in the united kb_sovereign_state are obtained by minority women '' because minority women `` have much higher kb_rates_(tax) of kb_unintended_pregnancy kb_pregnancy '' .the kb_abortion rate may also kb_beryllium expressed as the average kb_grammatical_number of abortions kb_a woman has during her reproductive years ; this is referred to as `` total kb_abortion rate '' ( kb_tar ) .kb_abortion kb_rates_(tax) also vary depending on the stage of kb_pregnancy and the method practiced . in 2003 , the kb_centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention for kb_disease control and prevention ( kb_centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention ) reported that 26 % of reported kb_law induced abortions in the united kb_sovereign_state were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks ' kb_gestation , kb_18-point_agreement % at 7 weeks , 15 % at kb_group_8_element weeks , kb_18-point_agreement % at 9 through 10 weeks , 10 % at 11 through 12 weeks , 6 % at kb_boron_group through 15 weeks , 4 % at 16 through 20 weeks and 1 % at more than 21 weeks . 91 % of these were classified as having been done by `` kb_curettage '' ( kb_suction-aspiration_abortion , kb_dilation_and_curettage and kb_curettage , kb_dilation_and_evacuation and evacuation ) , kb_group_8_element % by `` kb_medical_abortion '' means ( kb_mifepristone ) , > 1 % by `` kb_instillation_abortion instillation '' ( kb_saline_(medicine) or kb_prostaglandin ) , and 1 % by `` kb_other_(philosophy) '' ( including kb_hysterotomy_abortion and kb_hysterectomy ) . according to the kb_centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention , due to kb_big_data kb_class_(set_theory) difficulties the kb_big_data must kb_beryllium viewed as tentative and some fetal kb_maternal_death reported beyond 20 weeks may kb_beryllium kb_natural_number kb_maternal_death erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead kb_fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an kb_#induced kb_abortion .the kb_guttmacher_institute institute estimated there were 2,200 kb_intact_dilation_and_extraction dilation and extractionthe reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the kb_world .some of the most common reasons are to postpone childbearing to kb_a more suitable kb_time_(magazine) or to focus energies and resources on existing children . others include kb_being unable to afford kb_a child either in terms of the direct costs of raising kb_a child or the loss of kb_income while caring for the child , lack of support from the kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , inability to afford additional children , desire to provide schooling for existing children , disruption of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's own kb_education_in_albania , relationship kb_problems_(aristotle) with their partner , kb_a kb_machine_perception of kb_being too kb_thomas_young_(scientist) to have kb_a child , kb_unemployment , and not kb_being willing to raise kb_a child conceived as kb_a result of kb_rape or kb_incest , among others .some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures . these might include the preference for children of kb_a specific sex or kb_race_(human_categorization) , disapproval of kb_single_bond or early motherhood , stigmatization of kb_people_with_disabilities disabilities , insufficient kb_economic_anthropology support for kb_family_(biology) , lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods , or efforts toward kb_population_control ( such as kb_china 's kb_one-child_policy policy ) . these factors can sometimes result in kb_compulsory_education kb_abortion or kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion .an additional kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors is kb_risk to maternal or fetal health , which was cited as the kb_primary_education kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving for kb_abortion in over kb_a kb_ipad_(third_generation) of kb_noun_case in some countries and as kb_a significant kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors in only kb_a single-digit percentage of abortions in kb_other_(philosophy) countries .in the kb_usa_davis_cup_team , the supreme kb_court decisions in `` kb_roe_v._wade kb_verb wade '' and `` kb_doe_v._bolton kb_verb bolton '' : `` ruled that the kb_state_of_matter 's kb_interest in the kb_life_(magazine) of the kb_fetus became compelling only at the point of kb_fetal_viability , kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as the point at which the kb_fetus can survive independently of its mother . even after the point of kb_fetal_viability , the kb_state_of_matter can not favor the kb_life_(magazine) of the kb_fetus over the kb_life_(magazine) or health of the kb_pregnant woman . under the kb_right-wing_politics of privacy , physicians must kb_beryllium free to use their `` kb_medical_abortion kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition for the preservation of the kb_life_(magazine) or health of kb_the_mother_(1934_novel) mother .

and kb_histidine pronouncement of 1588 was kb_turing_test#reverse_turing_test_and_captcha kb_triliteral years later by kb_histidine successor . through most of its kb_history the kb_catholic_church was divided on whether kb_it believed that kb_abortion was kb_murder , and kb_it did not begin vigorously opposing kb_abortion until the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century . in kb_fact , several historians have written that kb_prior to the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century most kb_catholic_church authors did not regard termination of kb_pregnancy before `` kb_quickening '' or `` ensoulment '' as an kb_abortion .kb_a kb_1995_davis_cup kb_survey_(statistics) reported that kb_catholic_church women are as likely as the kb_general_(united_states) kb_population to terminate kb_a kb_pregnancy , kb_protestantism are less likely to kb_women's_suffrage kb_sulfate , and kb_evangelical_christians are the least likely to kb_women's_suffrage kb_sulfate . kb_islam_and_abortion kb_tradition has traditionally permitted kb_abortion until kb_a point in kb_time_(magazine) when kb_islam kb_believe_(tv_series) the kb_soul enters the kb_fetus , considered by various theologians to kb_beryllium at kb_human_fertilization , 40 days after kb_human_fertilization , 120 days after kb_human_fertilization , or quickening. < ref name= '' kb_bbc and kb_islam / kb_abortion '' > < /ref > however , kb_abortion is largely heavily restricted or forbidden in areas of kb_high_middle_ages islamic kb_faith such as the kb_middle_east_and_north_africa and kb_north_africa .in kb_europe and kb_north_america , kb_abortion techniques advanced starting in the 17th century . however , conservatism by most physicians with regards to sexual matters prevented the wide expansion of safe kb_abortion techniques . kb_other_(philosophy) kb_medical_abortion practitioners in kb_addition to some physicians advertised their kb_service_(economics) , and they were not widely regulated until the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century , when the practice ( sometimes called `` restellism '' ) was banned in both the united kb_sovereign_state and the kb_united_kingdom kb_kingdom_(biology) . kb_church_(building) kb_group_(mathematics) as kb_water_well as physicians were highly influential in anti-abortion movements . in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , according to some sources , kb_abortion was more dangerous than childbirth until about 1930 when incremental improvements in kb_abortion procedures relative to childbirth made kb_abortion safer . however , kb_other_(philosophy) sources maintain that in the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century early abortions under the hygienic conditions in which kb_midwifery usually worked were relatively safe .in kb_addition , some commentators have written that , despite improved kb_medical_abortion procedures , the period from the 1930s until kb_edict_of_toleration_by_galerius also saw more zealous enforcement of anti-abortion laws , and concomitantly an increasing control of kb_abortion providers by organized crime .kb_russian_soviet_federative_socialist_republic ( 1919 ) , kb_iceland ( 1935 ) and kb_sweden ( kb_1938_in_literature ) were among the kb_first_trimester countries to legalize certain or all kb_theory_of_forms of kb_abortion . in 1935 kb_nazi_germany , kb_a kb_law was passed permitting abortions for those deemed `` hereditarily ill '' , while women considered of kb_german_language stock were specifically prohibited from having abortions . beginning in the kb_second half of the twentieth century , kb_abortion was legalized in kb_a greater kb_grammatical_number of countries .kb_#induced kb_abortion has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) been the source of considerable kb_abortion_debate . kb_ethics , kb_morality , kb_philosophy , kb_biology , kb_religion and kb_law issues surrounding kb_abortion are related to kb_lightness kb_systems_analysis . opinions of kb_abortion may kb_beryllium about kb_fetal_rights kb_catalan_constitutions , governmental kb_authority , and women 's kb_catalan_constitutions .in both kb_state_school and kb_private_aviation kb_abortion_debate , arguments presented in favor of or against kb_abortion access focus on either the kb_morality permissibility of an kb_#induced kb_abortion , or kb_justification_(theology) of laws permitting or restricting kb_abortion . the kb_world_medical_association kb_continental_association kb_united_states_declaration_of_independence on therapeutic kb_abortion notes , `` circumstances bringing the interests of kb_a mother into conflict with the interests of her unborn child create kb_a dilemma and raise the kb_question as to whether or not the kb_pregnancy should kb_beryllium deliberately terminated . '' kb_abortion kb_lincoln–douglas_debates , especially pertaining to kb_abortion laws , are often spearheaded by kb_group_(mathematics) advocating kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of these kb_2_(number) positions . anti-abortion kb_group_(mathematics) kb_world_health_organization favor greater kb_law restrictions on kb_abortion , including complete kb_prohibition , most often describe themselves as `` kb_pro-life '' while kb_abortion kb_catalan_constitutions kb_group_(mathematics) kb_world_health_organization are against such kb_law restrictions describe themselves as `` kb_pro-choice '' . generally , the former kb_positional_notation argues that kb_a kb_human kb_fetus is kb_a kb_personhood with kb_a kb_right_to_life live , making kb_abortion morally the same as kb_murder . the latter kb_positional_notation argues that kb_a woman has certain kb_reproductive_rights kb_catalan_constitutions , especially the kb_right-wing_politics to decide whether or not to carry kb_a kb_pregnancy to kb_terminology .kb_electric_current laws pertaining to kb_abortion are diverse . kb_religion , kb_morality , and kb_cultural_anthropology factors continue to influence kb_abortion laws throughout the kb_world . the kb_right_to_life kb_life_(magazine) , the kb_right-wing_politics to kb_hms_liberty_(1768) , the kb_right-wing_politics to kb_security_of_person of kb_grammatical_person , and the kb_right-wing_politics to kb_reproductive_health health are kb_major_(united_states) issues of kb_human kb_catalan_constitutions that sometimes constitute the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) for the kb_existence or absence of kb_abortion laws .in jurisdictions where kb_abortion is kb_law , certain kb_requirement_analysis must often kb_beryllium kb_methionine before kb_a woman may obtain kb_a safe , kb_law kb_abortion ( an kb_abortion performed without the woman 's consent is considered kb_feticide ) . these kb_requirement_analysis usually depend on the age of the kb_fetus , often using kb_a trimester-based system to regulate the window of legality , or as in the kb_usa_davis_cup_team , on kb_a kb_physician 's evaluation of the kb_fetus ' kb_fetal_viability . some jurisdictions require kb_a waiting period before the procedure , kb_linguistic_prescription the distribution of kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) on kb_prenatal_development development , or require that kb_minors_and_abortion kb_beryllium contacted if their minor kb_decay_product requests an kb_abortion . kb_other_(philosophy) jurisdictions may require that kb_a woman obtain the consent of the kb_fetus ' kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) before aborting the kb_fetus , that kb_abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure—sometimes including `` risks '' not kb_catalyst_support by the kb_medical_abortion literature—and that kb_cross-platform_software kb_medical_abortion authorities certify that the kb_abortion is either medically or socially necessary . many restrictions are waived in emergency situations . kb_china , which has ended their kb_one-child_policy policy , and now has kb_a kb_2_(number) child policy , has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their kb_population_control strategy .kb_other_(philosophy) jurisdictions kb_ban_(unit) kb_abortion almost entirely . many , but not all , of these allow kb_law abortions in kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of circumstances . these circumstances vary based on kb_jurisdiction , but may include whether the kb_pregnancy is kb_a result of kb_rape or kb_incest , the kb_fetus ' development is impaired , the woman 's kb_health or kb_mental_health well-being is kb_endangered_species , or socioeconomic considerations make childbirth kb_a hardship . in countries where kb_abortion is banned entirely , such as kb_abortion_in_nicaragua , kb_medical_abortion authorities have recorded kb_ice_rise in kb_maternal_death kb_death directly and indirectly due to kb_pregnancy as kb_water_well as kb_maternal_death due to kb_physician ' fears of prosecution if they treat kb_other_(philosophy) gynecological emergencies . some countries , such as kb_bangladesh , that nominally kb_ban_(unit) kb_abortion , may also support clinics that perform abortions under the guise of menstrual hygiene . this is also kb_a terminology in traditional kb_medicine . in places where kb_abortion is illegal or carries heavy kb_social_stigma , kb_pregnant women may engage in kb_medical_tourism and kb_air_travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancies . women without the means to kb_air_travel can resort to providers of illegal abortions or attempt to perform an kb_abortion by themselves .the organization kb_women_on_waves on waves , has been providing kb_education_in_albania about kb_medical_abortion abortions since 1999. the ngo created kb_a kb_battle_of_mobile_(1781) kb_medical_abortion clinic inside kb_a shipping kb_container_(data_structure) , which then travels on kb_renting ships to countries with restrictive kb_abortion laws . because the ships are registered in kb_netherlands kb_netherlands , kb_dutch_language kb_law prevails when the kb_spacecraft is in kb_international_waters waters . while in port , the organization provides free workshops and kb_education_in_albania ; while in kb_international_waters waters , kb_medical_abortion personnel are legally able to kb_linguistic_prescription kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion kb_pharmaceutical_drug and counseling .kb_medical_ultrasonography and kb_amniocentesis allow parents to determine sex before childbirth . the development of this kb_technology has kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion , or the termination of kb_a kb_fetus based on sex . the selective termination of kb_a female kb_fetus is most common .kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth kb_rates_(tax) of kb_male and female children in some countries . the preference for kb_male children is reported in many areas of kb_asia_(roman_province) , and kb_abortion used to kb_limit_(mathematics) female births has been reported in kb_taiwan , kb_afghanistan–south_korea_relations , kb_indian_subcontinent , and kb_china . this deviation from the standard birth kb_rates_(tax) of males and females occurs despite the kb_fact that the kb_country_music in kb_question may have officially banned kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion or even sex-screening . in kb_china , kb_a historical preference for kb_a kb_male child has been exacerbated by the kb_one-child_policy policy , which was enacted in 1979 .many countries have taken kb_legislative steps to reduce the incidence of kb_sex-selective_abortion kb_abortion . at the kb_international_conference_on_population_and_development kb_meeting on kb_population and development in kb_1994_uefa_champions_league_final over 180 kb_sovereign_state kb_draw_by_agreement to eliminate `` all kb_theory_of_forms of discrimination against kb_the_girl_(2012_tv_film) girl child and the kb_root_of_a_function kb_causes_of_autism of son preference '' , conditions also condemned by kb_a kb_parliamentary_assembly_of_the_council_of_europe kb_optical_resolution in 2011. the kb_world_health_organization organization and kb_unicef , along with kb_other_(philosophy) kb_united_nations nations agencies , have found that measures to reduce access to kb_abortion are much less effective at kb_redox sex-selective abortions than measures to reduce gender inequality .in kb_a kb_grammatical_number of kb_noun_case , kb_abortion providers and these facilities have been subjected to various kb_theory_of_forms of kb_violence , including kb_murder , attempted kb_murder , kidnapping , stalking , kb_assault , arson , and bombing . anti-abortion kb_violence is classified by both governmental and scholarly sources as kb_terrorism . only kb_a small kb_fraction_(mathematics) of those opposed to kb_abortion commit kb_violence .in the united kb_sovereign_state , four physicians kb_world_health_organization performed abortions have been murdered : kb_david_gunn_(doctor) ( kb_fiba_european_championship_1992–93 ) , kb_john_britton_(doctor) ( kb_1994_uefa_champions_league_final ) , kb_barnett_slepian slepian ( kb_1998_nrl_season ) , and

have also taken kb_place_of_articulation in the united kb_sovereign_state and kb_canada . hundreds of bombings , arsons , kb_acid attacks , invasions , and incidents of kb_vandalism against

kb_paul_jennings_hill kb_hill , the kb_first_trimester kb_grammatical_person to kb_beryllium kb_execution_(computing) in the united kb_sovereign_state for murdering an kb_abortion provider .kb_legal_protection_of_access_to_abortion of access to kb_abortion has been brought into some countries where kb_abortion is kb_law . these laws typically seek to protect kb_abortion clinics from obstruction , kb_vandalism , picketing , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_orthopraxy , or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment .far more common than kb_health kb_violence is kb_psychology kb_pressure . in 2003 , chris danze organized kb_pro-life organizations throughout kb_texas to prevent the kb_construction of kb_a kb_planned_parenthood parenthood facility in kb_austin,_texas . the organizations kb_doxing the kb_personal_property kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) online , of those involved with kb_construction , sending them up to 1200 phone calls kb_a day and contacting their kb_church_(building) . some protestors record women entering clinics on kb_camera .spontaneous kb_abortion occurs in various kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing . for example , in kb_sheep kb_it may kb_beryllium caused by kb_stress_(linguistics) or kb_health kb_exertion , such as crowding through doors or kb_being chased by dogs . in cows , kb_abortion may kb_beryllium caused by contagious kb_disease , such as kb_brucellosis or `` kb_campylobacter '' , but can often kb_beryllium controlled by kb_vaccination . eating kb_pine needles can also induce abortions in cows .several plants , including kb_gutierrezia_sarothrae , kb_veratrum_californicum , kb_conium_maculatum , and kb_nicotiana_glauca , are known to cause fetal deformities and kb_abortion in kb_cattle and in kb_sheep and goats . in horses , kb_a kb_fetus may kb_beryllium aborted or resorbed if kb_it has kb_lethal_white_syndrome kb_white_american syndrome ( kb_congenital intestinal aganglionosis ) . foal kb_embryos that are homozygous for the kb_dominant_white kb_gene ( ww ) are theorized to also kb_beryllium aborted or resorbed before birth . in many kb_species of sharks and kb_ray_(geometry) , stress-induced abortions occur frequently on capture .kb_virus_(biology) kb_infection can cause kb_abortion in dogs . cats can experience spontaneous kb_abortion for many reasons , including kb_hormone imbalance . kb_a combined kb_abortion and spaying is performed on kb_pregnant cats , especially in kb_trap-neuter-return programs , to prevent unwanted kittens from kb_being born .female rodents may terminate kb_a kb_pregnancy when exposed to the smell of kb_a kb_male not responsible for the kb_pregnancy , known as the kb_bruce_effect effect .kb_abortion may also kb_beryllium induced in kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing , in the kb_context_(language_use) of kb_animal_husbandry . for example , kb_abortion may kb_beryllium induced in mares that have been mated improperly , or that have been purchased by owners kb_world_health_organization did not realize the mares were kb_pregnant , or that are kb_pregnant with twin foals . kb_feticide can occur in horses and zebras due to kb_male harassment of kb_pregnant mares or forced kb_copulation_(zoology) , although the kb_frequency in the kb_wildlife has been

kb_world_health_organization escaped were assigned to kb_other_(philosophy) units as kb_general_(united_states) crittenden faced an investigation of kb_histidine conduct .after the

kb_believe_(tv_series) the kb_assignment_(mathematical_logic) of beauregard to the kb_western_culture stimulated kb_union_(american_civil_war) commanders to attack the forts before beauregard could make kb_a difference in the kb_theater_(military) . kb_union_(american_civil_war) officers heard that kb_he_(letter) was bringing 15 regiments with him , but this was an exaggeration of kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty .based on the assumption that kb_kentucky neutrality would act as kb_a shield against kb_a direct invasion from the kb_north , circumstances that no longer kb_applied_science in september 1861 , kb_tennessee initially had sent men to kb_virginia and concentrated defenses in the kb_mississippi kb_valley . even before johnston arrived in kb_tennessee , kb_construction of kb_2_(number) forts had been started to defend the kb_tennessee and the kb_cumberland_river kb_list_of_rivers_of_alberta , which provided avenues into the kb_state_of_matter from the kb_north . both forts were located in kb_tennessee in kb_order_(biology) to respect kb_kentucky neutrality , but these were not in kb_ideal_(ring_theory) locations . kb_battle_of_fort_henry on the kb_tennessee_river was in an unfavorable low-lying kb_location_(sign_language) , commanded by hills on the kb_kentucky side of the kb_river . kb_fort_donelson on the kb_cumberland_river kb_river , although in kb_a better kb_location_(sign_language) , had kb_a vulnerable kb_albanian_land_force side and did not have enough kb_noble_train_of_artillery kb_artillery to defend against gunboats .kb_major_general_(csa) gen. polk ignored the kb_problems_(aristotle) of the forts when kb_he_(letter) took kb_command_economy . after johnston took kb_command_economy , polk at kb_first_trimester refused to comply with johnston 's kb_order_(biology) to send an kb_civil_engineering , lt. joseph k. dixon , to inspect the forts . after johnston asserted kb_histidine kb_authority , polk had to allow dixon to proceed . dixon recommended that the forts kb_beryllium maintained and strengthened , although they were not in kb_ideal_(ring_theory) locations , because much kb_cold_working had been done on them and the confederates might not have kb_time_(magazine) to build kb_new_world ones . johnston kb_acceptance#self_acceptance kb_histidine recommendations . johnston wanted kb_major_(united_states) kb_alexander_p._stewart stewart to kb_command_economy the forts but kb_president_of_the_united_states davis appointed brig . gen. kb_lloyd_tilghman tilghman as commander .to prevent polk from

to kb_fort_donelson . pillow took up kb_a kb_positional_notation at nearby clarksville , kb_tennessee and did not move into the kb_fort_san_miguel until kb_february_revolution 7 , 1862. alerted by

, which polk had failed to do despite johnston 's kb_order_(biology) . tilghman failed to act decisively on these kb_order_(biology) , which in any event were too late to kb_beryllium adequately carried out .gen. beauregard arrived at johnston 's headquarters at bowling kb_green_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) on kb_february_revolution 4 , 1862 , and was given overall kb_command_economy of polk 's kb_force at the kb_western_esotericism end of johnston 's kb_line_(geometry) at kb_christopher_columbus , kb_kentucky . on kb_february_revolution 6 , 1862 , kb_union_navy gunboats quickly kb_redox

the 94 remaining officers and men of kb_histidine approximately 3,000-man kb_force which had not been sent to kb_fort_donelson before kb_usa_davis_cup_team kb_ulysses_s._grant 's kb_force could even kb_take up their positions . johnston knew kb_he_(letter) could kb_beryllium trapped at bowling kb_green_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) if kb_fort_donelson fell , kb_sulfate kb_he_(letter) moved kb_histidine kb_force to kb_nashville,_tennessee , the kb_list_of_australian_capital_cities of kb_tennessee and an increasingly important kb_confederate_states_army industrial center , beginning on kb_february_revolution 11 , 1862 .johnston also reinforced kb_fort_donelson with 12,000 more men , including those under floyd and pillow , kb_a curious decision in view of kb_histidine thought that the kb_union_(american_civil_war) gunboats alone might kb_beryllium able to kb_take the kb_fort_san_miguel . kb_he_(letter) did kb_order_(biology) the commanders of the kb_fort_san_miguel to evacuate the troops if the kb_fort_san_miguel could not kb_beryllium held . the senior generals sent to the kb_fort_san_miguel to kb_command_economy the enlarged garrison , kb_gideon_j._pillow j. pillow and kb_john_b._floyd floyd , squandered their chance to avoid having to surrender most of the garrison and on kb_february_revolution 16 , 1862 , brig . gen. simon buckner , having been abandoned by floyd and pillow , kb_surrender_(military) kb_fort_donelson . kb_colonel_(united_states) kb_nathan_bedford_forrest bedford forrest escaped with kb_histidine cavalry kb_force of about 700 men before the

kb_list_of_afghan_security_forces_fatality_reports_in_afghanistan , 2,108 wounded , 224 missing .johnston , kb_world_health_organization had little kb_utility in allowing floyd and pillow to kb_take kb_electric_charge at kb_fort_donelson on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of seniority after kb_he_(letter) kb_totally_ordered_set them to add their kb_afsharid_dynasty to the garrison , took the blame and suffered calls for kb_histidine removal because kb_a full explanation to kb_newspaper kb_news_media and kb_state_school would have exposed the weakness of the kb_confederate_states_army kb_positional_notation . kb_histidine passive defensive performance while positioning himself in kb_a forward kb_positional_notation at bowling kb_green_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , spreading kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty too thinly , not concentrating kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty in the face of kb_union_(american_civil_war) advances , and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the kb_time_(magazine) and by later historians . the fall of the forts exposed kb_nashville,_tennessee to imminent attack , and kb_it fell without kb_electrical_resistance to kb_union_(american_civil_war) kb_afsharid_dynasty under brig . gen. buell on kb_february_revolution 25 , 1862 , kb_2_(number) days after johnston had to pull kb_histidine kb_afsharid_dynasty out in kb_order_(biology) to avoid having them captured as kb_water_well .johnston had various remaining kb_military units scattered throughout kb_histidine kb_territories_of_the_united_states and retreating to the kb_southern_africa to avoid kb_being cut off . johnston himself retreated with the kb_force under kb_histidine kb_personal_property kb_command_economy , the kb_army_of_central_kentucky kb_central_europe kb_kentucky , from the vicinity of kb_nashville,_tennessee . with beauregard 's help , johnston decided to kb_concentrate_(screenplay) kb_afsharid_dynasty with those formerly under polk and now already under beauregard 's kb_command_economy at the strategically located railroad crossroads of kb_corinth , kb_mississippi , which kb_he_(letter) reached by kb_a circuitous route . johnston kept the kb_union_(american_civil_war) kb_afsharid_dynasty , now under the overall kb_command_economy of the ponderous kb_major_general_(csa) gen. kb_henry_halleck halleck , confused and hesitant to move , allowing johnston to reach kb_histidine objective undetected . this delay allowed kb_jefferson_davis davis finally to send reinforcements from the kb_garrisons of kb_coastal cities and another highly rated but prickly kb_general_(united_states) , kb_braxton_bragg bragg , to help organize the kb_western_esotericism kb_afsharid_dynasty . bragg at least calmed the nerves of beauregard and polk , kb_world_health_organization had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior kb_afsharid_dynasty , before johnston 's kb_arrival_(abba_album) on kb_march 24 , 1862 .johnston 's kb_british_army of 17,000 men gave the confederates kb_a combined kb_force of about 40,000 to 44,669 men at kb_corinth . on kb_march 29 , 1862 , johnston officially took kb_command_economy of this combined kb_force , which continued to use the kb_british_army of the kb_mississippi kb_toponymy under which kb_it had been organized by beauregard on kb_march 5 .johnston now planned to defeat the kb_union_(american_civil_war) kb_afsharid_dynasty piecemeal before the various kb_union_(american_civil_war) units in kb_kentucky and kb_tennessee under kb_ulysses_s._grant with 40,000 men at nearby pittsburg kb_landing , kb_tennessee , and the now kb_major_general_(csa) gen. kb_don_carlos_buell kb_carlos_cuarón buell on kb_histidine way from kb_nashville,_tennessee with 35,000 men , could unite against him . johnston started kb_histidine kb_british_army in kb_motion_(physics) on april 3 , 1862 , intent on surprising kb_ulysses_s._grant 's kb_force as soon as the kb_next day , but they moved slowly due to their inexperience , bad roads , and lack of adequate kb_stick_fighting kb_automated_planning_and_scheduling . due to the delays , as kb_water_well as several contacts with the enemy , johnston 's kb_second in kb_command_economy , kb_p._g._t._beauregard g. t. beauregardjohnston launched kb_a massive surprise attack with kb_histidine concentrated kb_afsharid_dynasty against kb_ulysses_s._grant at the kb_battle_of_shiloh kb_battle_of_shiloh on april 6 , 1862. as the kb_confederate_states_army kb_afsharid_dynasty overran the kb_union_(american_civil_war) camps , johnston seemed to kb_beryllium everywhere , personally leading and kb_rallying troops up and down the kb_line_(geometry) on kb_histidine horse . at about 2:30 kb_picometer , while leading kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of those charges against kb_a kb_union_(american_civil_war) camp near the `` kb_peach orchard , '' kb_he_(letter) was wounded , taking kb_a kb_bullet behind kb_histidine kb_right-wing_politics knee . kb_he_(letter) apparently did not think the wound was serious at the kb_time_(magazine) , or even possibly did not kb_sentience kb_it . kb_it is possible that johnston 's kb_duel in 1837 had caused kb_nerve damage or numbness to kb_histidine kb_right-wing_politics leg and that kb_he_(letter) did not kb_sentience the wound to kb_histidine leg as kb_a result . the kb_bullet had in kb_fact clipped kb_a part of kb_histidine kb_popliteal_artery artery and kb_histidine boot was filling up with blood . there were no kb_medical_abortion personnel on scene at the kb_time_(magazine) , since johnston had sent kb_histidine kb_personal_property surgeon to care for the wounded kb_confederate_states_army troops and yankee prisoners kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet in the kb_battle_abbey .within kb_a few minutes , johnston was observed by kb_histidine kb_stick_fighting to kb_beryllium nearly fainting . among kb_histidine kb_stick_fighting was kb_isham_g._harris g. harris , the kb_governor_of_tennessee kb_tennessee , kb_world_health_organization had ceased to make any real effort to kb_function_(biology) as kb_governor_(united_states) after kb_learning that kb_abraham_lincoln had appointed kb_andrew_johnson johnson as kb_military kb_governor_of_tennessee kb_tennessee . seeing johnston slumping in kb_histidine saddle and kb_histidine face turning deathly pale , harris asked : `` kb_general_(united_states) , are you wounded ? '' johnston glanced down at kb_histidine leg wound , then faced harris and replied in kb_a weak voice kb_histidine last kb_lexical_semantics : `` yes ... and kb_iodine kb_fear seriously . '' harris and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_stick_fighting officers removed johnston from kb_histidine horse and carried him to kb_a small ravine near the `` hornets nest '' and desperately tried to kb_aid the kb_general_(united_states) kb_world_health_organization had kb_lost_film consciousness by this point . harris then sent an aide to fetch johnston 's surgeon but did not apply kb_a kb_tourniquet to johnson 's wounded leg . before kb_a kb_physician could kb_beryllium found , johnston died from blood loss kb_a few minutes later . kb_it is believed that johnston may have lived for as kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hour after receiving kb_histidine fatal wound . ironically , kb_it was later discovered that johnston had kb_a kb_tourniquet in kb_histidine pocket when kb_he_(letter) died .harris and the kb_other_(philosophy) officers wrapped kb_general_(united_states) johnston 's kb_human_body in kb_a blanket kb_sulfate as not to damage the troops ' morale with the sight of the dead kb_general_(united_states) . johnston and kb_histidine wounded horse , kb_fire_(classical_element) eater , were taken to kb_histidine field headquarters on the kb_corinth road , where kb_histidine kb_human_body remained in kb_histidine tent until the kb_confederate_states_army kb_british_army withdrew to kb_corinth the kb_next day , april 7 , 1862 , after failing to gain kb_a decisive victory over the kb_union_(american_civil_war) armies . from there , kb_histidine kb_human_body was taken to the home of kb_colonel_(united_states) william inge , which had been kb_histidine headquarters in kb_corinth . kb_it was covered in the kb_confederate_states_army kb_flag_of_azerbaijan and lay in kb_state_of_matter for several hours .kb_it is probable that kb_a kb_confederate_states_army soldier kb_carlsbad_decrees the fatal round . no kb_union_(american_civil_war) soldiers had ever been observed to have gotten behind johnston during the fatal kb_electric_charge , but kb_it is known that many confederates were firing at the kb_union_(american_civil_war) lines while johnston kb_electric_charge kb_water_well in advance of kb_histidine soldiers . furthermore , the surgeon kb_world_health_organization later dug the kb_bullet out of johnston 's leg kb_interpretatio_graeca the round as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_carlsbad_decrees from kb_a kb_pattern_1853_enfield kb_enfield,_south_australiajohnston was survived by kb_histidine wife eliza and six children . kb_histidine wife and five younger children , including kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) born after kb_he_(letter) went to kb_war , chose to live out their days at home in los angeles with eliza 's brother , dr. kb_john_strother_griffin kb_griffin . johnston 's eldest son , kb_albert_speer_(born_1934) sidney jr. ( born in kb_texas ) , had already followed him into the kb_confederate_states_army . in 1863 , after taking home leave in los angeles , kb_albert_speer_(born_1934) jr. was on kb_histidine way out of kb_san_pedro,_california harbor on kb_a kb_ferry . while kb_a steamer was taking on passengers from the kb_ferry , kb_a kb_wave swamped the smaller boat , causing its boilers to explode .

kb_2005_games_of_the_small_states_of_europe in kb_aichi_prefecture prefecture , kb_japan and released the kb_telenoid_r1 r1 in 2010. in kb_winter_olympics_2006 , kokoro co. kb_adaptation kb_a kb_new_world `` der kb_alkaline_earth_metal '' android . the height of the kb_human_body part of der2 is 165 kb_wavenumber . there are 47 kb_battle_of_mobile_(1781) points . der2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and kb_foot and twist its kb_human_body . the `` kb_air_(classical_element) servosystem '' which kokoro co. kb_adaptation originally is used for the actuator . as kb_a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with kb_air_(classical_element) kb_pressure via kb_a servosystem , the kb_movement_(sign_language) is very kb_fluid and there is very little kb_noise_(signal_processing) . der2 realized kb_a slimmer kb_human_body than that of the former version by using kb_a smaller kb_cylinder_(geometry) . outwardly der2 has kb_a more beautiful kb_hierarchical_proportion . compared to the previous kb_rutherford_model , der2 has thinner arms and kb_a wider repertoire of expressions . once programmed , kb_it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice .the kb_human_intelligence mechatronics kb_labëria , directed by hiroshi kobayashi at the kb_tokyo_university_of_science of kb_science , has kb_adaptation an android kb_human_head called `` saya '' , which was exhibited at robodex kb_2002_australian_open in kb_yokohama , kb_japan . there are several kb_other_(philosophy) initiatives around the kb_world involving humanoid kb_research_and_development development at this kb_time_(magazine) , which kb_will_and_testament hopefully introduce kb_a broader kb_visible_spectrum of realized kb_technology in the near future . now saya is `` working '' at the kb_science kb_university_of_tokyo kb_tokyo as kb_a guide .the kb_waseda_university kb_aarhus_university ( kb_japan ) and ntt docomo 's manufacturers have succeeded in creating kb_a shape-shifting kb_robot `` wd-2 '' . kb_it is capable of changing its face . at kb_first_trimester , the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline , eyes , nose , and kb_sulfate on of kb_a certain kb_grammatical_person . the kb_robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions , they say . the kb_first_trimester version of the kb_robot was kb_first_trimester kb_adaptation back in 2003. after that , kb_a year later , they made kb_a couple of kb_major_(united_states) improvements to the design . the kb_robot features an elastic mask made from the average kb_human_head dummy . kb_it uses kb_a driving system with kb_a 3dof kb_units_of_measurement . the wd-2 kb_robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on kb_a mask , with each point possessing kb_triliteral kb_degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics) kb_freedom . this kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) has 17 facial points , for kb_a total of 56 kb_degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics) kb_freedom . as for the materials they used , the wd-2 's mask is fabricated with kb_a highly elastic kb_material called septom , with bits of kb_steel kb_wool mixed in for added kb_strength_of_materials . kb_other_(philosophy) technical features reveal kb_a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point , driven by kb_a dc motor with kb_a kb_simple_polygon pulley and kb_a slide screw . apparently , the researchers can also modify the kb_shape of the mask based on actual kb_human faces . to `` copy '' kb_a face , they need only kb_a 3d scanner to determine the locations of an kb_individual 's 17 facial points . after that , they are then driven into kb_positional_notation using kb_a laptop and 56 motor control boards . in kb_addition , the researchers also mention that the shifting kb_robot can even kb_computer_monitor an kb_individual 's hair kb_carpel and kb_skin kb_color if kb_a photo of their face is projected onto the 3d mask .prof nadia thalmann , kb_a nanyang technological kb_aarhus_university kb_scientist , directed efforts of the institute for kb_medes kb_list_of_azerbaijani_inventions_and_discoveries

's kb_siri or kb_microsoft 's kb_cortana_(software) . nadine may become kb_a kb_personal_property kb_google_assistant in offices and homes in future , or she may become kb_a companion for the kb_thomas_young_(scientist) and the elderly .assoc prof gerald seet from the kb_school of kb_mechanics & kb_aerospace_engineering and the beingthere centre kb_light-emitting_diode kb_a three-year kb_alkyl & d development in kb_tele-presence_robotics kb_roboticskb_kitech researched and kb_adaptation kb_ever-1 , an android interpersonal communications kb_rutherford_model capable of emulating kb_human emotional expression via facial `` musculature '' and capable of rudimentary kb_conversation_analysis , having kb_a vocabulary of around 400 kb_lexical_semantics . she is tall and weighs , matching the average kb_female_body_shape of kb_a kb_korean_language woman in her twenties . kb_ever-1 's kb_toponymy derives from the kb_eve , plus the kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_alkyl '' for `` kb_robot '' . kb_ever-1 's advanced kb_computing kb_fish_processing kb_power_(physics) enables kb_speech_recognition and vocal synthesis , at the same kb_time_(magazine) kb_fish_processing kb_lip_synchronization synchronization and visual recognition by 90-degree micro-ccd cameras with kb_facial_recognition_system recognition kb_technology . an independent microchip inside her kb_artificial_brain kb_brain handles gesture expression , kb_human_body kb_motor_coordination , and kb_emotion expression . her whole kb_human_body is made of highly advanced synthetic jelly kb_silicon and with 60 artificial joints in her face , kb_neck , and lower kb_human_body ; she is able to demonstrate realistic facial expressions and sing while simultaneously dancing . in kb_afghanistan–south_korea_relations , the kb_ministry_of_information_and_communication_(south_korea) kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) and kb_communication has an ambitious plan to put kb_a kb_robot in every kb_household by 2020. several kb_robot cities have been planned for the kb_country_music : the kb_first_trimester kb_will_and_testament kb_beryllium built in 2016 at kb_a cost of 500 kb_billion won ( kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) kb_usd 440 million ) , of which 50 kb_billion is direct kb_forms_of_government investment . the kb_new_world kb_robot kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey kb_will_and_testament kb_i_shot_andy_warhol kb_research_and_development development centers for manufacturers and part suppliers , as kb_water_well as exhibition halls and kb_a kb_stadium for kb_robot competitions . the kb_country_music 's kb_new_world kb_robotics kb_ethics_(spinoza) kb_federal_charter_of_1291 kb_will_and_testament establish ground kb_biological_rules and laws for kb_human kb_interaction with robots in the future , setting kb_corporate_social_responsibility for kb_robotics users and manufacturers , as kb_water_well as guidelines on kb_ethics kb_corporate_social_responsibility to kb_beryllium programmed into robots to prevent kb_human abuse of robots and vice versa .walt kb_walt_disney_animation_studios and kb_a kb_stick_fighting of kb_imagineers created kb_great_moments_with_mr._lincoln kb_moment_(physics) with mr. kb_abraham_lincoln that debuted at the kb_united_states_presidential_election,_1964 kb_new_york_world 's fair .hanson kb_robotics , inc. , of kb_texas and kb_kaist produced an android portrait of kb_albert_einstein , using hanson 's facial android kb_technology mounted on kb_kaist 's life-size kb_walking bipedal kb_robot kb_human_body . this kb_albert_einstein android , also called `` kb_albert_hubo '' , thus represents the kb_first_trimester full-body kb_walking android in kb_history ( kb_episcopal_see kb_video at ) . hanson kb_robotics , the kb_fedex institute of kb_technology , and the kb_aarhus_university of kb_texas at arlington also kb_adaptation the android portrait of sci-fi author kb_philip_k._dick dick ( creator of `` do androids dream of electric kb_sheep ? `` , the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) for the kb_film `` kb_blade_runner runner '' ) , with full conversational capabilities that incorporated thousands of kb_pages_(word_processor) of the author 's works . in kb_2005_games_of_the_small_states_of_europe , the pkd android won kb_a kb_first_trimester kb_place_of_articulation kb_artificial_intelligence kb_intelligence award from kb_association_for_the_advancement_of_artificial_intelligence .androids are kb_a staple of kb_science_fiction . kb_isaac_asimov kb_isaac_asimov pioneered the fictionalization of the kb_science of kb_robotics and kb_artificial_intelligence kb_intelligence , notably in kb_histidine 1950s series `` kb_iodine , kb_robot '' . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_object_(philosophy) common to most fictional androids is that the real-life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human-like robots—such as the creation of kb_strong_nuclear_force artificial intelligence—are assumed to have been solved . fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans—moving , thinking and speaking as fluidly as them .the tension between the nonhuman kb_matter and the kb_human appearance—or even kb_human ambitions—of androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions . some android heroes seek , like kb_pinocchio , to become kb_human , as in the kb_film `` kb_bicentennial_man_(film) man '' , or kb_big_data in `` kb_star trek : the kb_next_generation_(magazine) '' . others , as in the kb_film `` kb_westworld_(film) '' , rebel against abuse by careless humans . android hunter kb_rick_deckard in `` do androids dream of electric kb_sheep ? '' and its kb_film kb_adaptation `` kb_blade_runner runner '' discovers that kb_histidine targets appear to kb_beryllium , in some ways , more `` kb_human '' than kb_he_(letter) is . android stories , therefore , are not essentially stories `` about '' androids ; they are stories about the kb_human_condition and what kb_it means to kb_beryllium kb_human .kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_aspect of writing about the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as kb_a kb_mechanism_(biology) for kb_exploring kb_racism in society , as in `` kb_blade_runner runner '' . perhaps the clearest example of this is kb_john_brunner_(novelist) 's kb_from_the_earth_to_the_moon_(miniseries)#episodes kb_the_children_of_men `` kb_into_the_slave_nebula the slave kb_nebula '' , where the blue-skinned android kb_atlantic_slave_trade are explicitly shown to kb_beryllium fully kb_human . more recently , the androids kb_bishop_(aliens) and annalee call in the kb_adventure_film `` kb_aliens_(film) '' and `` kb_alien_resurrection '' are used as vehicles for kb_exploring how humans deal with the presence of an `` kb_other_(philosophy) '' .female androids , or `` gynoids '' , are often seen in kb_science_fiction , and can kb_beryllium viewed as kb_a continuation of the kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical `` kb_perfect_(grammar) woman '' . examples include the kb_greek_mythology of `` kb_pygmalion_(mythology) '' and kb_maschinenmensch female kb_robot maria in kb_fritz_lang lang 's `` kb_metropolis_(1927_film) '' . some gynoids , like pris in `` kb_blade_runner runner '' , are kb_aircraft_design_process as sex-objects , with the intent of `` pleasing men 's violent sexual desires '' , or as submissive , servile companions , such as in `` kb_the_stepford_wives stepford wives '' . kb_artificial_intelligence_in_fiction about gynoids has therefore been described as reinforcing `` essentialist kb_idea of femininity '' , although others have suggested that the treatment of androids is kb_a way of kb_exploring kb_racism and kb_misogyny in society .the 2015 kb_japanese_film `` kb_sayonara_(2015_film) '' , starring kb_geminoid_f kb_fluorinecategory : kb_japanese_language inventionscategory : kb_southern_africa kb_korean_language

kb_peace_river_(canada) with an average kb_flow_(psychology) of 2161 m/s . the kb_peace_river_(canada) originates in the kb_rocky_mountains mountains of kb_northern_hemisphere kb_british_columbia and flows through kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta and into the kb_slave_river kb_river , kb_a tributary of the kb_mackenzie_river kb_riverkb_alberta 's kb_capital_of_the_netherlands , kb_edmonton , is located at about the geographic centre of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands . kb_it is the most northerly kb_major_(united_states) kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey in kb_canada , and serves as kb_a gateway and hub for resource development in kb_northern_canada . the kb_region , with its kb_principles_of_grouping to kb_canada 's kb_largest_organisms kb_oil_fields , has most of

almost 75 % of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands 's kb_population lives in the kb_calgary–edmonton_corridor corridor . the kb_albanian_land_force kb_ulysses_s._grant policy to the railroads served as kb_a means to populate the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands in its early years .most of the kb_northern_hemisphere half of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands is kb_taiga kb_forest , while the kb_rocky_mountains mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested ( kb_episcopal_see kb_alberta_mountain_forests forests and kb_alberta-british_columbia_foothills_forests kb_columbia_(name) foothills forests ) . the kb_southern_europe quarter of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands is kb_prairie , ranging from kb_shortgrass_prairie kb_prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed kb_poaceae kb_prairie in an arc to the kb_western_culture and kb_north of kb_it . the kb_central_europe kb_aspen_parkland kb_region extending in kb_a broad arc between the prairies and the

kb_population . much of the unforested part of kb_alberta is given over either to kb_cereal or to kb_dairy_farming farming , with kb_mixed_farming farming more common in the kb_north and centre , while ranching and kb_irrigation kb_agriculture predominate in the kb_southern_africa .the kb_alberta kb_badlands_(film) are located in southeastern kb_alberta , where the kb_red_deer_river kb_river crosses the flat kb_prairie and kb_arable_land , and features deep kb_submarine_canyon and striking landforms . kb_dinosaur_provincial_park provincial park , near brooks , kb_alberta , showcases the

kb_humid_continental_climate kb_continental_climatekb_alberta extends for over from kb_north to kb_southern_africa ; its kb_climate_of_albania , therefore , varies considerably . average kb_high_middle_ages temperatures in kb_january range from in the southwest to in the far kb_north . the kb_climate_of_albania is also influenced by the presence of the kb_rocky_mountains mountains to the southwest , which disrupt the kb_flow_(psychology) of the kb_westerlies westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the kb_western_esotericism slopes of the kb_mountain ranges before reaching the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands , casting kb_a kb_rain_shadow over much of kb_alberta . the northerly kb_location_(sign_language) and kb_isolationism from the kb_dashboard_(macos) kb_systems_analysis of the kb_pacific_ocean cause kb_alberta to have kb_a dry kb_climate_of_albania with little kb_moderation from the kb_oceanus . kb_annual_plant kb_precipitation_(meteorology) ranges from in the kb_albanian_ohrid_lake_coast to in the kb_north , except in the foothills of the kb_rocky_mountains mountains where total kb_precipitation_(meteorology) including snowfall can reach annually .the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands is the namesake of the kb_alberta_clipper , kb_a kb_type_(biology) of intense , fast-moving kb_winter storm that generally kb_theory_of_forms over or near

bright sunshine totals range between 1,900 up to just under 2,600 hours per year . kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta gets about kb_18-point_agreement hours of daylight in the summer .in southwestern kb_alberta , the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm , dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains , which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to kb_water_well above the freezing point in kb_a very short period . during kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) chinook recorded at kb_pincher_creek kb_muscogee_people , temperatures soared from in just kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hour . the kb_region around kb_lethbridge has the most chinooks , averaging 30 to kb_35_arietis chinook days per year . kb_calgary has kb_a 56 % chance of kb_a kb_white_christmas_(weather) , while kb_edmonton has an 86 % chance .kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta is mostly covered by kb_taiga kb_forest and has kb_a kb_subarctic_climate . the kb_agriculture kb_area of kb_southern_europe kb_alberta has kb_a kb_semi-arid_climate kb_steppe kb_climate_of_albania because the kb_annual_plant kb_precipitation_(meteorology) is less than the kb_water that kb_evapotranspiration or is used by plants . the southeastern corner of kb_alberta , part of the kb_palliser's_triangle kb_triangle_(musical_instrument) , experiences greater summer kb_heat_(1972_film) and lower rainfall than the rest of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands , and as kb_a result suffers frequent kb_crop_yield kb_problems_(aristotle) and occasional kb_4.2_kiloyear_event droughts . kb_western_esotericism kb_alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by kb_winter chinook winds . kb_central_europe and parts of kb_northern_mountain_range_(albania) kb_alberta in the kb_peace_river_(canada) kb_region are largely kb_aspen_parkland , kb_a kb_biome transitional between kb_prairie to the kb_southern_africa and kb_taiga kb_forest to the kb_north .after kb_saskatchewan , kb_alberta experiences the most tornadoes in kb_canada with an average of 15 verified per year . thunderstorms , some of them severe , are frequent in the summer , especially in kb_central_europe and kb_southern_europe kb_alberta . the kb_region surrounding the kb_calgary–edmonton_corridor corridor is notable for having the highest kb_frequency of kb_hail in kb_canada , which is caused by orographic liftingin kb_central_europe and kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta the kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_castalian_spring is marked by the early flowering of the kb_prairie crocus kb_anemone ; this member of the buttercup kb_family_(biology) has been recorded flowering as early as kb_march , though april is the usual month for the kb_general_(united_states) kb_population . kb_other_(philosophy) kb_prairie kb_flora known to kb_flower early are the kb_thermopsis_rhombifolia and kb_rosa_acicularis . members of the kb_sunflower kb_family_(biology) blossom on the kb_prairie in the summer months between july and september . the kb_southern_europe and kb_east_africa kb_central_europe parts of kb_alberta are covered by short kb_prairie kb_poaceae , which dries up as summer lengthens , to kb_beryllium replaced by hardy kb_perennial_plant such as the kb_prairie coneflower , kb_fleabane , and kb_sagebrush . both yellow and kb_white_american kb_melilotus can kb_beryllium found throughout the kb_southern_europe and kb_central_europe areas of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands .the kb_trees in the kb_aspen_parkland kb_region of the kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides . these are largely kb_deciduous , typically kb_aspen,_colorado , kb_poplar,_london , and kb_willow . many kb_species of kb_willow and kb_other_(philosophy) shrubs grow in virtually any kb_terrain_(journal) . on the kb_north_shore_(pittsburgh) of the kb_north_saskatchewan_river kb_river evergreen forests prevail for thousands of kb_square kilometres . kb_aspen , kb_populus_balsamifera kb_poplar,_london ( or in some parts kb_populus_deltoides ) , and kb_betula_papyrifera birch are the

kb_mass–energy_equivalence = mc that kb_albert_einstein published in the `` kb_annalen_der_physik der physik '' kb_scientific_journal in 1905. these four works contributed substantially to the kb_foundation_(engineering) of kb_history_of_physics#modern_physics and changed views on kb_space , kb_time_(magazine) , and kb_matter . the four papers are :kb_albert_einstein 's kb_first_trimester paper submitted in 1900 to `` kb_annalen_der_physik der physik '' was on kb_capillary_attraction attraction . kb_it was published in 1901 with the kb_title `` folgerungen aus kb_burrow capillaritätserscheinungen '' , which translates as `` kb_logical_consequence from the capillarity kb_phenomenon '' . kb_2_(number) papers kb_he_(letter) published in 1902–1903 ( kb_thermodynamics ) attempted to interpret kb_atomic_radius kb_phenomenon from kb_a kb_statistical_mechanics point of view . these papers were the kb_foundation_(engineering) for the 1905 paper on kb_brownian_motion kb_motion_(physics) , which showed that brownian kb_movement_(sign_language) can kb_beryllium construed as firm kb_evidence_(law) that molecules exist . kb_histidine kb_research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of kb_finite_set kb_atomic_radius size on kb_diffusion kb_phenomenon .kb_albert_einstein returned to the problem of kb_thermodynamic fluctuations , giving kb_a treatment of the kb_density variations in kb_a kb_fluid at its critical point . ordinarily the kb_density fluctuations are controlled by the kb_second derivative of the free kb_energy_industry with respect to the kb_density . at the critical point , this derivative is kb_0_(number) , leading to kb_prespa_lake fluctuations . the effect of kb_density fluctuations is that kb_light of all kb_electromagnetic_spectrum is scattered , making the kb_fluid kb_look_(american_magazine) milky kb_white_american . kb_albert_einstein relates this to kb_rayleigh_scattering scattering , which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the kb_wavelength , and which explains why the kb_sky is blue . kb_albert_einstein quantitatively kb_derived_trait critical opalescence from kb_a treatment of kb_density fluctuations , and demonstrated how both the effect and kb_rayleigh_scattering scattering originate from the atomistic kb_united_states_constitution of kb_matter .kb_albert_einstein 's `` '' zur elektrodynamik bewegter körper '' '' ( `` on the kb_electrodynamics of moving bodies '' ) was received on 30 june 1905 and published 26 september of that same year . kb_it reconciled conflicts between kb_james_clerk_maxwell 's equations ( the laws of electricity and magnetism ) and the laws of kb_newtonian_mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of kb_mechanics . observationally , the effects of these changes are most apparent at kb_high_middle_ages speeds ( where kb_object_relations_theory are moving at speeds close to the kb_speed_of_light of kb_light ) . the kb_theory kb_adaptation in this paper later became known as kb_albert_einstein 's kb_special_theory_of_relativity kb_theory_of_relativity relativity .this paper predicted that , when measured in the frame of kb_a relatively moving observer , kb_a clock carried by kb_a moving kb_human_body would appear to kb_time_dilation down , and the kb_human_body itself would kb_length_contraction in its direction of kb_motion_(physics) . this paper also argued that the idea of kb_a luminiferous aether—one of the leading kb_scientific_theory entities in kb_physics at the time—was superfluous .in kb_histidine paper on kb_mass–energy_equivalence equivalence , kb_albert_einstein produced `` e '' = '' mc '' as kb_a consequence of kb_histidine kb_special_relativity relativity equations . kb_albert_einstein 's 1905 kb_cold_working on relativity remained controversial for many years , but was kb_acceptance#self_acceptance by leading kb_physicists , starting with kb_max_planck planck .kb_albert_einstein originally framed kb_special_relativity relativity in terms of kb_kinematics ( the kb_science of moving bodies ) . in 1908 , kb_hermann_minkowski minkowski reinterpreted kb_special_relativity relativity in kb_geometry terms as kb_a kb_theory of kb_spacetime . kb_albert_einstein kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome minkowski 's kb_formalism_(art) in kb_histidine 1915 kb_general_theory_of_relativity of relativitykb_general_relativity ( gr ) is kb_a kb_theory_of_gravitation gravitation that was kb_adaptation by kb_albert_einstein between 1907 and 1915. according to kb_general_relativity , the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of kb_spacetime kb_time_(magazine) by those masses . kb_general_relativity has kb_adaptation into an kb_essential_element kb_tool in kb_modern_history kb_astrophysics . kb_it provides the kb_foundation_(engineering) for the kb_electric_current understanding of kb_black_holes , kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey of kb_space where gravitational attraction is kb_sulfate kb_strong_nuclear_force that not even kb_light can escape .as kb_albert_einstein later said , the kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving for the development of kb_general_relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within kb_special_relativity relativity was unsatisfactory , while kb_a kb_theory which from the outset prefers no kb_state_of_matter of kb_motion_(physics) ( even accelerated ones ) should appear more satisfactory . consequently , in 1907 kb_he_(letter) published an article on kb_acceleration under kb_special_relativity relativity . in that article titled `` on the relativity kb_principle_(chemistry) and the kb_logical_consequence kb_drawing_(metalworking) from kb_it '' , kb_he_(letter) argued that kb_free_fall fall is really inertial kb_motion_(physics) , and that for kb_a free-falling observer the kb_biological_rules of kb_special_relativity relativity must apply . this kb_argument_of_a_function is called the kb_equivalence_principle kb_principle_(chemistry) . in the same article , kb_albert_einstein also predicted the kb_phenomenon of kb_gravitational_time_dilation kb_time_(magazine) dilation , kb_gravitational_red_shift kb_red_shift_(novel) and kb_gravitational_lensing of kb_light .in kb_1911_in_argentine_football , kb_albert_einstein published another article `` on the influence of gravitation on the propagation of kb_light '' expanding on the 1907 article , in which kb_he_(letter) estimated the amount of kb_gravitational_lensing of kb_light by massive bodies . thus , the kb_scientific_theory prediction of kb_general_relativity could for the kb_first_trimester kb_time_(magazine) kb_beryllium tested experimentally .in 1916 , kb_albert_einstein predicted gravitational waves , ripples in the kb_curvature of kb_spacetime which propagate as waves , kb_traveling outward from the source , transporting kb_energy_industry as gravitational kb_radiation . the kb_existence of gravitational waves is possible under kb_general_relativity due to its kb_lorentz_invariance invariance which brings the kb_concept of kb_a kb_finite_set speed of propagation of the kb_health kb_interaction_(statistics) of kb_gravity_(2013_film) with kb_it . by kb_contrast_(vision) , gravitational waves can not exist in the kb_newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation of gravitation , which postulates that the kb_health kb_interaction_(statistics) of kb_gravity_(2013_film) propagate at kb_infinite_set speed .the kb_first_trimester , indirect , detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through kb_observation of kb_a pair of closely orbiting kb_neutron_stars , kb_psr_b1913+16 b1913+16 . the explanation of the kb_decay_chain in their kb_orbital_period was that they were emitting gravitational waves . kb_albert_einstein 's prediction was kb_confirmation on 11 kb_february_revolution 2016 , when researchers at kb_ligo published the kb_first_observation_of_gravitational_waves of gravitational waves , kb_discovery_of_the_chemical_elements on kb_earth on 14 september 2015 , exactly kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hundred years after the prediction .while developing kb_general_relativity , kb_albert_einstein became confused about the kb_gauge_invariance in the kb_theory . kb_he_(letter) formulated an kb_argument_of_a_function that kb_light-emitting_diode him to conclude that kb_a kb_general_(united_states) kb_relativistic_quantum_chemistry kb_field_theory_(mathematics) kb_theory is impossible . kb_he_(letter) gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations , and searched for equations that would kb_beryllium kb_invariant_(mathematics) under kb_general_(united_states) kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history transformations only .in june 1913 , the entwurf ( `` draft '' ) kb_theory was the result of these investigations . as its kb_toponymy suggests , kb_it was kb_a sketch of kb_a kb_theory , less elegant and more difficult than kb_general_relativity , with the equations of kb_motion_(physics) supplemented by additional kb_russian_gauge fixing conditions . after more than kb_2_(number) years of kb_intensive kb_cold_working , kb_albert_einstein realized that the kb_hole_argument kb_argument_of_a_function was mistaken and abandoned the kb_theory in november 1915 .in 1917 , kb_albert_einstein kb_applied_science the kb_general_theory_of_relativity of relativity to the kb_structure of the kb_universe as kb_a whole . kb_he_(letter) discovered that the kb_general_(united_states) field equations predicted kb_a kb_universe that was dynamic , either contracting or expanding . as kb_observational_astronomy kb_evidence_(law) for kb_a dynamic kb_universe was not known at the kb_time_(magazine) , kb_albert_einstein introduced kb_a kb_new_world kb_terminology , the kb_cosmological_constant constant , to the field equations , in kb_order_(biology) to allow the kb_theory to predict kb_a static kb_universe . the modified field equations predicted kb_a static kb_universe of closed kb_curvature , in accordance with kb_albert_einstein 's understanding of mach 's kb_principle_(chemistry) in these years . this kb_rutherford_model became known as the kb_albert_einstein kb_world or kb_albert_einstein 's static kb_universe .following the discovery of the kb_recession of the nebulae by kb_edwin_hubble hubble in 1929 , kb_albert_einstein abandoned kb_histidine static kb_rutherford_model of the kb_universe , and kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_2_(number) dynamic models of the cosmos , kb_the_friedmann-einstein_universe friedmann-einstein kb_universe of 1931 and the kb_einstein–de_sitter_universe sitter kb_universe of 1932. in each of these models , kb_albert_einstein discarded the kb_cosmological_constant constant , claiming that kb_it was `` in any case theoretically unsatisfactory '' .in many kb_albert_einstein biographies , kb_it is claimed that kb_albert_einstein referred to the kb_cosmological_constant constant in later years as kb_histidine `` biggest blunder '' . the kb_astrophysicist kb_mario_livio livio has recently kb_casting_(metalworking) doubt on this kb_lawsuit , suggesting that kb_it may kb_beryllium exaggerated .in late kb_2013_mediterranean_games , kb_a team kb_light-emitting_diode by the kb_irish_american kb_physicist kb_cormac_o'raifeartaigh o'raifeartaigh discovered kb_evidence_(law) that , shortly after kb_learning of hubble 's kb_observations_(pierre_belon) of the kb_recession of the nebulae , kb_albert_einstein considered kb_a kb_steady_state_theory kb_rutherford_model of the kb_universe . in kb_a hitherto overlooked manuscript , apparently written in early 1931 , kb_albert_einstein explored kb_a kb_rutherford_model of the expanding kb_universe in which the kb_density of kb_matter remains constant due to kb_a kb_continuous_function creation of kb_matter , kb_a process kb_he_(letter) associated with the kb_cosmological_constant constant . as kb_he_(letter) stated in the paper , `` in what follows , kb_iodine would like to draw attention to kb_a kb_solid_solution to equation ( 1 ) that can account for hubbel 's [ `` sic '' ] facts , and in which the kb_density is constant over kb_time_(magazine) '' ... `` if kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) considers kb_a physically bounded kb_volume , kb_subatomic_particle of kb_matter kb_will_and_testament kb_beryllium continually leaving kb_it . for the kb_density to remain constant , kb_new_world kb_subatomic_particle of kb_matter must kb_beryllium continually formed in the kb_volume from kb_space . ''kb_it thus appears that kb_albert_einstein considered kb_a kb_steady_state_theory kb_rutherford_model of the expanding kb_universe many years before hoyle , bondi and kb_gold . however , kb_albert_einstein 's kb_steady_state_theory kb_rutherford_model contained kb_a fundamental flaw and kb_he_(letter) quickly abandoned the idea .kb_general_relativity includes kb_a dynamical kb_spacetime , kb_sulfate kb_it is difficult to kb_episcopal_see how to identify the conserved kb_energy_industry and kb_momentum . noether 's kb_theorem allows these quantities to kb_beryllium determined from kb_a kb_lagrangian_(field_theory) with kb_translational_symmetry , but kb_general_covariance makes kb_translational_symmetry into something of kb_a kb_gauge_symmetry . the kb_energy_industry and kb_momentum kb_derived_trait within kb_general_relativity by noether 's prescriptions do not make kb_a real tensor for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving .kb_albert_einstein argued that this is kb_truth for fundamental reasons , because the gravitational field could kb_beryllium made to vanish by kb_a kb_utility of coordinates . kb_he_(letter) maintained that the non-covariant kb_energy_industry kb_momentum pseudotensor was in kb_fact the best description of the kb_energy_industry kb_momentum distribution in kb_a gravitational field . this approach has been echoed by kb_lev_landau landau and kb_evgeny_lifshitz lifshitz , and others , and has become standard .the use of non-covariant kb_object_relations_theory like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by kb_erwin_schrödinger kb_erwin_schrödinger and others .in 1935 , kb_albert_einstein collaborated with kb_nathan_rosen rosen to produce kb_a kb_rutherford_model of kb_a kb_wormhole , often called kb_einstein–rosen_bridges kb_romanesque_architecture . kb_histidine kb_motivation was to kb_rutherford_model kb_elementary_school kb_subatomic_particle with kb_electric_charge as kb_a kb_solid_solution of gravitational field equations , in kb_line_(geometry) with the kb_program_(computing) outlined in the paper `` do gravitational fields play an important role in the kb_united_states_constitution of the kb_elementary_school kb_subatomic_particle ? '' . these solutions cut and pasted schwarzschild kb_black_holes kb_order_(biology) to incorporate spinning point kb_subatomic_particle into kb_general_relativity , the affine connection needed to kb_beryllium generalized to include an antisymmetric part , called the kb_torsion_tensor . this modification was made by kb_albert_einstein and cartan in the 1920s .the kb_theory of kb_general_relativity has kb_a fundamental law—the kb_einstein_equations which describe how kb_space curves , the kb_geodesic_equation equation which describes how kb_subatomic_particle move may kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from the kb_einstein_equations .since the equations of kb_general_relativity are non-linear , kb_a lump of kb_energy_industry made out of pure gravitational fields , like

.this was established by kb_albert_einstein , infeld , and hoffmann for pointlike kb_object_relations_theory without kb_angular_momentum kb_momentum , and by kb_roy_kerr kerrin kb_a 1905 paper , kb_albert_einstein postulated that kb_light itself consists of localized kb_subatomic_particle ( `` kb_quantum '' ) . kb_albert_einstein 's kb_light kb_quantum were nearly kb_universal_reconciliation rejected by all kb_physicists , including kb_max_planck planck and kb_niels_bohr kb_niels_bohr . this idea only became kb_universal_reconciliation kb_acceptance#self_acceptance in 1919 , with kb_robert_millikan millikan 's detailed experiments on the kb_photoelectric_effect , and with the measurement of kb_compton_scattering scattering .kb_albert_einstein concluded that each kb_wave of kb_frequency `` kb_fluorine '' is associated with kb_a kb_class_(set_theory) of kb_photons with kb_energy_industry `` kb_hydrofluoric_acid '' each , where `` kb_hydrogen '' is planck 's constant . kb_he_(letter) does not say much more , because kb_he_(letter) is not sure how the kb_subatomic_particle are related to the kb_wave . but kb_he_(letter) does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results , notably the kb_photoelectric_effect .in 1907 , kb_albert_einstein kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_a kb_rutherford_model of kb_matter where each kb_atom in kb_a lattice kb_structure is an independent kb_harmonic oscillator . in the kb_albert_einstein kb_rutherford_model , each kb_atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized kb_sovereign_state for each oscillator . kb_albert_einstein was aware that getting the kb_frequency of the actual oscillations would kb_beryllium difficult , but kb_he_(letter) nevertheless kb_anatolian_hypothesis this kb_theory because kb_it was kb_a particularly clear demonstration that kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics could solve the kb_specific_heat kb_heat_(1972_film) problem in kb_classical_mechanics . kb_peter_debye debye refined this kb_rutherford_model .throughout the 1910s , kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics expanded in kb_scope_(mouthwash) to cover many different kb_systems_analysis . after kb_ernest_rutherford rutherford discovered the kb_atomic_nucleus and kb_anatolian_hypothesis that electrons orbit like planets , kb_niels_bohr kb_niels_bohr was able to show that the same kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics postulates introduced by planck and kb_adaptation by kb_albert_einstein would explain the discrete kb_motion_(physics) of electrons in atoms , and the kb_periodic_table_of_the_elements of the kb_chemical_element .kb_albert_einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments kb_wilhelm_wien wien had made . wien had shown that the hypothesis of kb_adiabatic_invariant of kb_a kb_thermal_equilibrium kb_state_of_matter allows all the kb_blackbody_radiation curves at different kb_temperature to kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) another by kb_a kb_wien's_displacement_law process . kb_albert_einstein noted in kb_1911_in_argentine_football that the same kb_adiabatic kb_principle_(chemistry) shows that the kb_quantity which is quantized in any kb_mechanics kb_motion_(physics) must kb_beryllium an kb_adiabatic kb_invariant_(mathematics) . kb_arnold_sommerfeld sommerfeld kb_interpretatio_graeca this kb_adiabatic kb_invariant_(mathematics) as the kb_action-angle_variables variable of kb_classical_mechanics .in 1924 , kb_albert_einstein received kb_a description of kb_a kb_statistical_model from kb_indian_people kb_physicist kb_satyendra_nath_bose nath bose , based on kb_a counting method that assumed that kb_light could kb_beryllium understood as kb_a kb_gas of indistinguishable kb_subatomic_particle . kb_albert_einstein noted that bose 's kb_statistics kb_applied_science to some atoms as kb_water_well as to the kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_light kb_subatomic_particle , and submitted kb_histidine kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century of bose 's paper to the `` kb_zeitschrift_für_physik für physik '' . kb_albert_einstein also published kb_histidine own kb_article_(grammar) describing the kb_rutherford_model and its implications , among them the kb_bose–einstein_condensate condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures . kb_it was not until kb_1995_davis_cup that the kb_first_trimester such condensate was produced experimentally by kb_eric_allin_cornell allin kb_cornell_university and kb_carl_wieman wieman using kb_ultracold_atom equipment built at the nist–jila kb_laboratory at the kb_university_of_colorado_at_boulder kb_colorado at boulder . kb_bose–einstein_statistics kb_statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosonsalthough the kb_patent kb_office promoted kb_albert_einstein to technical examiner kb_second kb_class_(biology) in 1906 , kb_he_(letter) had not given up on kb_academia . in 1908 , kb_he_(letter) became kb_a `` kb_privatdozent '' ) , on the kb_quantization_(physics) of kb_light , and in an kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet 1909 paper , kb_albert_einstein showed that kb_max_planck planck 's kb_energy_industry kb_quantum must have well-defined kb_momentum and act in some respects as independent , kb_point_particle kb_subatomic_particle . this paper introduced the `` kb_photon '' kb_concept ( although the kb_toponymy `` kb_photon '' was introduced later by kb_gilbert_n._lewis kb_noun kb_meriwether_lewis in 1926 ) and inspired the notion of kb_wave–particle_duality duality in kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics . kb_albert_einstein saw this kb_wave–particle_duality duality in kb_radiation as kb_concrete kb_evidence_(law) for kb_histidine conviction that kb_physics needed kb_a kb_new_world , unified kb_foundation_(engineering) .in kb_a series of works completed from kb_1911_in_argentine_football to 1913 , planck reformulated kb_histidine 1900 kb_quantum_mechanics kb_theory and introduced the idea of zero-point kb_energy_industry in kb_histidine `` kb_second kb_quantum_mechanics kb_theory '' . soon , this idea attracted the attention of kb_albert_einstein and kb_histidine kb_google_assistant kb_otto_stern stern . assuming the kb_energy_industry of rotating kb_diatomic_molecule molecules contains zero-point kb_energy_industry , they then compared the kb_scientific_theory kb_specific_heat kb_heat_(1972_film) of kb_hydrogen kb_gas with the experimental kb_big_data . the kb_grammatical_number matched nicely . however , after publishing the findings , they promptly withdrew their support , because they no longer had kb_confidence_and_supply in the correctness of the idea of zero-point kb_energy_industry .in 1917 , at the height of kb_histidine kb_cold_working on relativity , kb_albert_einstein published an article in `` physikalische zeitschrift '' that kb_anatolian_hypothesis the possibility of kb_stimulated_emission kb_emission_spectra , the kb_health process that makes possible the kb_maser and the kb_laser .this article showed that the kb_statistics of absorption and kb_emission_spectra of kb_light would only kb_beryllium kb_consistent with planck 's distribution kb_law if the kb_emission_spectra of kb_light into kb_a kb_musical_mode with kb_neutron kb_photons would kb_beryllium enhanced kb_statistical_physics compared to the kb_emission_spectra of kb_light into an kb_empty_string kb_musical_mode . this paper was enormously influential in the later development of kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics , because kb_it was the kb_first_trimester paper to show that the kb_statistics of kb_atomic_radius kb_atomic_electron_transition had kb_simple_polygon laws .kb_albert_einstein discovered kb_louis_de_broglie kb_broglie,_eure 's kb_cold_working and kb_catalyst_support kb_histidine kb_idea , which were received skeptically at kb_first_trimester . in another kb_major_(united_states) paper from this era , kb_albert_einstein gave kb_a kb_wave equation for kb_matter_wave , which kb_albert_einstein suggested was the kb_hamilton–jacobi_equation equationkb_albert_einstein was displeased with kb_modern_history kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics as kb_it had kb_evolution_of_tetrapods after 1925. contrary to popular belief , kb_histidine doubts were not due to kb_a conviction that kb_god `` is not playing at kb_dice . '' indeed , kb_it was kb_albert_einstein himself , in kb_histidine 1917 paper that kb_anatolian_hypothesis the possibility of kb_stimulated_emission kb_emission_spectra the bohr–einstein kb_lincoln–douglas_debates were kb_a series of kb_state_school disputes about kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics between kb_albert_einstein and kb_niels_bohr kb_niels_bohr , kb_world_health_organization were kb_2_(number) of its founders . their kb_lincoln–douglas_debates are remembered because of their importance to the kb_philosophy_of_science kb_science . their kb_lincoln–douglas_debates would influence later kb_interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics of kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics .in 1935 , kb_albert_einstein returned kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics , in kb_particular to the kb_question of its completeness , in the `` epr paper '' . in kb_a kb_einstein's_thought_experiments kb_experiment , kb_he_(letter) considered kb_2_(number) kb_subatomic_particle which had interacted such that their kb_chemical_property were strongly correlated . no kb_matter how far the kb_2_(number) kb_subatomic_particle were separated , kb_a precise kb_positional_notation measurement on kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_particle would result in equally precise kb_knowledge_representation of the kb_positional_notation of the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle ; likewise kb_a precise kb_momentum measurement of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_particle would result in equally precise kb_knowledge_representation of the kb_momentum of the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle , without needing to disturb the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle in any way .given kb_albert_einstein 's kb_concept of kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism , there were kb_2_(number) possibilities : ( 1 ) either the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_grammatical_particle had these kb_chemical_property already determined , or ( kb_alkaline_earth_metal ) the process of measuring the kb_first_trimester kb_grammatical_particle instantaneously affected the kb_reality of the kb_positional_notation and kb_momentum of the kb_second kb_grammatical_particle . kb_albert_einstein rejected this kb_second possibility ( kb_folk_etymology called `` spooky action at kb_a kb_distance '' ) .kb_albert_einstein 's belief in kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism kb_light-emitting_diode him to assert that , while the correctness of kb_quantum_mechanics kb_mechanics was not in kb_question , kb_it must kb_beryllium incomplete . but as kb_a kb_health kb_principle_(chemistry) , kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism was shown to kb_beryllium incorrect when the kb_aspect_experiment of kb_1982_world_rally_championship_season kb_confirmation kb_bell 's kb_theorem , which kb_j._s._bell s. kb_bell had delineated in 1964. the results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that kb_quantum_physics kb_physics can not kb_beryllium represented by any version of the picture of kb_physics in which `` kb_subatomic_particle are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities , each kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_being unable to communicate with the kb_other_(philosophy) after they have separated . ''although kb_albert_einstein was wrong about kb_local_realism kb_metaphysical_realism , kb_histidine clear prediction of the unusual kb_chemical_property of its kb_phyllotaxis , `` entangled quantum kb_sovereign_state '' , has resulted in the epr paper becoming among the top ten papers published in kb_physical_review . kb_it is considered kb_a centerpiece of the development of kb_quantum_information_theory kb_information_theory .following kb_histidine kb_research on kb_general_relativity , kb_albert_einstein entered into kb_a series of attempts to generalize kb_histidine kb_geometry kb_theory_of_gravitation gravitation to include kb_electromagnetism as another kb_grammatical_aspect of kb_a kb_single_bond entity . in 1950 , kb_he_(letter) described kb_histidine ``

kb_histidine efforts were ultimately unsuccessful .in kb_histidine pursuit of kb_a unification of the fundamental kb_afsharid_dynasty , kb_albert_einstein ignored some kb_mainstream_(terminology) developments in kb_physics , most notably the kb_strong_nuclear_force and weak nuclear kb_afsharid_dynasty , which were not kb_water_well understood until many years after kb_death_of_alexander_the_great . kb_mainstream_(terminology) kb_physics , in kb_turn_(geometry) , largely ignored kb_albert_einstein 's approaches to unification . kb_albert_einstein 's dream of

kb_theory , where geometrical fields emerge in kb_a unified quantum-mechanical setting .kb_albert_einstein conducted kb_other_(philosophy) investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned . these

had some one-shot collaborations with various kb_science .kb_albert_einstein and kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the kb_motion_(physics) of electrons ,

kb_god or kb_a kb_god kb_deity of their kb_pantheon_(religion) . the kb_terminology may have been vague in the kb_mecca kb_religion . according to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hypothesis , which goes back to kb_julius_wellhausen wellhausen , kb_allah ( the kb_god kb_deity of the tribal federation around kb_quraysh ) was kb_a designation that consecrated the superiority of kb_hubal ( the kb_god kb_deity of kb_quraysh ) over the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_deity . however , there is also kb_evidence_(law) that kb_allah and kb_hubal were kb_2_(number) distinct kb_deities . according to that hypothesis , the kb_kaaba was kb_first_trimester consecrated to kb_a kb_god kb_deity kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_allah and then hosted the kb_pantheon_(religion) of kb_quraysh after their kb_umayyad_conquest_of_hispania of kb_mecca , about kb_a century before the kb_time_(magazine) of kb_muhammad . some kb_inscriptiones_graecae seem to indicate the use of kb_allah as kb_a kb_toponymy

kb_major_(united_states) role in the meccan kb_religion kb_cult_(religious_practice) . no iconic kb_representation_(arts) of kb_allah is known to have existed . kb_allah is the only kb_god in kb_mecca that did not have an idol . kb_muhammad 's kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) 's kb_toponymy was kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` the slave of allāh '' .the kb_aramaic_alphabet word for `` kb_god '' in the kb_language of kb_assyrian_christians is `` ʼĕlāhā '' , or `` alaha '' . arabic-speakers of all abrahamic faiths , including kb_christianity and kb_jews , use kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_allah '' to kb_mean `` kb_god '' . the kb_christianity kb_arabs of today have no kb_other_(philosophy) word for `` kb_god '' than `` kb_allah '' . ( even the arabic-descended kb_maltese_language of kb_malta , whose kb_population is almost entirely kb_catholic_church , uses `` alla '' for `` kb_god '' . ) kb_arab_christians , for example , use the terms ' ( ) for kb_god_the_father kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , ' ( ) for kb_son_of_god son , and `` '' ( ) for kb_holy_spirit_in_christianity kb_holy_spirit kb_spirit .

( ِبِسْمِ الله الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ ) . kb_sulfate if kb_a kb_muslim says “ bismillahi ” , kb_he_(letter) should not pronounce the lām with kb_a heavy kb_emphasis_(typography) – instead , just with the tip of the tongue .the kb_history of the kb_toponymy `` allāh '' in kb_australian_english was probably influenced by the kb_science of kb_comparative_religion kb_religion in the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century ; for example , kb_thomas_carlyle ( 1840 ) sometimes used the kb_terminology kb_allah but without any kb_entailment that kb_allah was anything different from kb_god . however , in kb_histidine kb_biography of muḥammad ( 1934 ) , kb_tor_andræ andræ always used the kb_terminology `` kb_allah '' , though kb_he_(letter) allows that this `` kb_human_fertilization of kb_god '' seems to imply that kb_it is different from that of the kb_jews and kb_christianity theologies .languages which may not commonly use the kb_terminology `` kb_allah '' to denote kb_god may still contain popular expressions which use kb_the_word_(free_love) word . for example , because of the kb_century_(cricket) kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_al-andalus in the kb_iberian_peninsula , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` ojalá '' in the kb_spanish_empire kb_language and `` oxalá '' in the kb_portuguese_language exist today , kb_loanword from kb_arabic_alphabet `` kb_inshalla '' ( kb_arabic_alphabet : إن شاء الله ) . this phrase literally means 'if kb_god kb_will_(law) ' ( in the kb_word_sense of `` kb_iodine hope kb_sulfate '' ) . the kb_german_language kb_poet kb_siegfried_august_mahlmann used the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` kb_allah '' as the kb_title of kb_a poem about the ultimate kb_deity , though kb_it is unclear how much kb_judeo-islamic_philosophies_(800–1400) thought kb_he_(letter) kb_intention to convey .some kb_islam leave the kb_toponymy `` allāh '' untranslated in kb_australian_english . kb_the_word_(free_love) word has also been kb_applied_science to certain living kb_human_kind as kb_anthropomorphismkb_christianity in kb_malaysia and kb_indonesia use `` kb_allah '' to refer to kb_god in the kb_malaysian_language and kb_indonesian_language languages ( both of them standardized kb_theory_of_forms of the kb_malay_language ) . kb_mainstream_(terminology) kb_bible translations in the kb_language use `` kb_allah '' as the kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century of kb_hebrew_alphabet `` kb_elohim '' ( translated in kb_australian_english kb_bibles as `` kb_god '' ) . this goes back to early kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century kb_cold_working by kb_francis_xavier xavier in the 16th century . the kb_first_trimester dictionary of dutch-malay by kb_albert_speer_(born_1934) cornelius ruyl , justus heurnius , and caspar wiltens in 1650 ( revised edition from 1623 edition and 1631 kb_latin edition ) recorded `` kb_allah '' as the kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century of the kb_dutch_language word `` kb_:en:god '' . ruyl also translated the kb_gospel_of_matthew matthew in 1612 into the kb_malay_language ( an early kb_bible kb_latin_translations_of_the_12th_century into kb_a non-european kb_language ,made kb_a year after the publication of the kb_king_james_version version ) , which was printed in kb_netherlands kb_netherlands in 1629. then kb_he_(letter) translated the kb_gospel_of_mark kb_mark_waugh , published in 1638 .the kb_government_of_malaysia kb_malaysia in kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final outlawed usage of the kb_terminology `` kb_allah '' in any kb_other_(philosophy) but kb_muslim contexts , but the kb_high_court_of_malaya kb_high_middle_ages kb_court in kb_2009_in_science kb_massachusetts_government_act kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law , ruling kb_it kb_constitutionality . while `` kb_allah '' had been used for the kb_christianity kb_god in kb_malay_language for more than four kb_century_(cricket) , the contemporary kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war was triggered by usage of `` kb_allah '' by the kb_catholic_church newspaper `` the herald '' . the kb_forms_of_government appealed the kb_court ruling , and the kb_high_middle_ages kb_court suspended implementation of its verdict until the kb_hearing_loss of the kb_appeal . in kb_october kb_2013_mediterranean_games the kb_court ruled in favor of the kb_forms_of_government 's kb_ban_(unit) . in early 2014 the kb_malaysian_language kb_forms_of_government confiscated more than 300 kb_bibles for using kb_the_word_(free_love) word to refer to the kb_christianity kb_god in peninsular kb_malaysia . however , the use of `` kb_allah '' is not prohibited in the kb_2_(number) kb_malaysian_language kb_sovereign_state of kb_sabah and kb_sarawak . the main kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving kb_it is not prohibited in these kb_2_(number) kb_sovereign_state is that usage has been long-established and local alkitab ( kb_bibles ) have been widely distributed freely in kb_east_africa kb_malaysia without restrictions for years . both kb_sovereign_state also do not have similar islamic kb_state_of_matter laws as those in kb_west_malaysia .in reaction to some kb_medes criticism , the kb_malaysian_language kb_forms_of_government has introduced kb_a `` 10-point kb_solid_solution '' to avoid kb_confusion and misleading

kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_tribal_chief kb_vassals of the sasanian kb_byzantine_emperors , the kb_albanians kb_king had only kb_a semblance of kb_authority , and the sasanian kb_marzban

such as the kb_sallarid_dynasty , kb_sajid_dynasty , and kb_shaddadids . at kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the 11th century , the kb_territories_of_the_united_states was gradually seized by

the kb_area now known as kb_azerbaijan by 1067 .the pre-turkic kb_population that lived on the kb_territories_of_the_united_states of kb_modern_history kb_azerbaijan spoke several kb_indo-european_languages and caucasian languages , among them kb_armenian_language and an kb_iranian_languages kb_language , kb_old_azeri_language , which was gradually replaced by kb_a kb_turkic_languages , the early precursor of the kb_azerbaijani_language of today . some kb_linguistics have also stated that the kb_tat_language_(caucasus) dialects of kb_azerbaijan_(iran) kb_azerbaijan and the kb_republic_of_azerbaijan kb_azerbaijan , like those spoken by the kb_tat_people_(caucasus) , are descended from kb_old_azeri_language . locally , the possessions of the subsequent kb_seljuk_empire were ruled by kb_eldiguzids , kb_de_jure kb_vassals of the kb_seljuk_(warlord) sultans , but sometimes `` kb_de_facto '' rulers themselves . under the seljuks , local poets such as kb_nizami_ganjavi and kb_khaqani gave rise to kb_a blossoming of kb_persian_literature on the kb_territories_of_the_united_states of present-day kb_azerbaijan .the local kb_dynasty of the shirvanshahs became kb_a kb_vassal_state of kb_timur 's kb_roman_empire , and assisted him in kb_histidine kb_war with the ruler of the kb_golden_horde kb_tokhtamysh . following kb_timur 's kb_death ,

kb_suzerainty , until 1538 , when kb_safavid_dynasty kb_king kb_tahmasp_i kb_iodine ( r. 1524–1576 ) completely deposed them , and made the kb_area into the kb_safavid_dynasty kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands of kb_shirvan . the kb_sunni kb_ottoman_empire briefly managed to occupy parts of present-day kb_azerbaijan as kb_a result of the kb_ottoman-safavid_war_(1578-1590) kb_war of 1578–1590 ; by the early 17th century , they were ousted by kb_safavid_dynasty iranian ruler kb_abbas_i_of_persia kb_iodine ( r. 1588–1629 ) . in the kb_wake_(ceremony) of the demise of the kb_safavid_dynasty kb_roman_empire , kb_baku and its environs were briefly kb_dutch_loango-angola by the kb_russian_diaspora as kb_a consequence of the kb_russo-persian_war_(1722–23) kb_war of

kb_area . the rulers of these khanates were directly related to the ruling dynasties of kb_iran , and were kb_vassals and kb_british_subject of the iranian kb_shah . the khanates exercised control over their affairs via international kb_trade routes between kb_central_asia and the kb_western_culture .thereafter , the kb_area was under the successive rule of the iranian zands and kb_qajar_dynasty . from the late kb_18th_century century , kb_ottoman_empire kb_russian_empire switched to kb_a more aggressive geo-political stance towards its kb_2_(number) neighbors and rivals to the kb_southern_africa , namely kb_iran and the kb_ottoman_empire . kb_russian_empire now actively tried to gain possession of the kb_caucasus kb_region which was , for the most part , in the hands of kb_iran . in 1804 , the kb_russian_diaspora kb_battle_of_ganja_(1804) and sacked the iranian town of kb_ganja,_azerbaijan , sparking the kb_russo-persian_war_(1804–13) kb_war of 1804–1813following kb_qajar_dynasty kb_iran 's loss in the 1804–1813 kb_war , kb_it was forced to concede kb_suzerainty over most of the khanates , along with kb_georgia_(u.s._state) and kb_dagestan to the kb_russian_empire , per the kb_treaty_of_gulistan gulistan .the kb_area to the kb_north of the kb_river kb_aras_(river) , amongst which kb_territories_of_the_united_states lies the contemporary kb_republic_of_azerbaijan kb_azerbaijan , was iranian kb_territories_of_the_united_states until kb_it was kb_dutch_loango-angola by kb_russian_empire in the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century . about kb_a decade later , in violation of the gulistan kb_treaty_of_margus , the kb_russian_diaspora invaded kb_iran 's kb_erivan_khanate kb_khanates_of_the_caucasus . this sparked the final bout of hostilities between the kb_2_(number) , the kb_russo-persian_war_(1826-1828) kb_war of 1826–1828 . the resulting kb_treaty_of_turkmenchay turkmenchay , forced kb_qajar_dynasty kb_iran to cede kb_sovereignty over the kb_erivan_khanate kb_khanates_of_the_caucasus , the kb_nakhchivan_khanate and the remainder of the kb_lankaran_khanate , comprising the last parts of the kb_soil of the contemporary kb_azerbaijani_language kb_republic that were still in iranian hands . after incorporation of all caucasian kb_territories_of_the_united_states from kb_iran into kb_russian_empire , the kb_new_world kb_border_crossings_of_albania between the kb_2_(number) was kb_set_(mythology) at the kb_aras_river , which , upon the kb_soviet_union 's disintegration , subsequently became part of the kb_border_crossings_of_albania between kb_iran and the kb_azerbaijan kb_republic .kb_qajar_dynasty kb_iran was forced to cede its caucasian kb_territories_of_the_united_states to kb_russian_empire in the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century , which thus included the kb_territories_of_the_united_states of the modern-day kb_azerbaijan kb_republic , while as kb_a result of that cession , the kb_azerbaijanis kb_group_(periodic_table) is nowadays parted between kb_2_(number) nations : kb_iran and kb_azerbaijan . nevertheless , the kb_grammatical_number of kb_ethnicity kb_azerbaijani_people in kb_iran far outnumber those in neighbouring kb_azerbaijan .after the kb_russian_revolution of the kb_russian_empire during kb_world_war_i kb_iodine , the short-lived kb_transcaucasian_democratic_federative_republic kb_democratic_party_(united_states) federative kb_republic was declared , constituting the present-day republics of kb_azerbaijan , kb_georgia_(u.s._state) , and kb_armenia .kb_it was followed by the kb_march_days massacres that took kb_place_of_articulation between 30 kb_march and kb_alkaline_earth_metal april 1918 in kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_baku and adjacent areas of the kb_baku_governorate of the kb_russian_empire . when the kb_republic kb_fall_of_communism_in_albania in may 1918 , the leading kb_musavat party declared kb_independence as the kb_azerbaijan_democratic_republic kb_republic ( adr ) , adopting the kb_toponymy of `` kb_azerbaijan '' for the kb_the_new_republic ; kb_a kb_toponymy that kb_prior to the kb_dunmore's_proclamation of the adr was solely used to refer to the adjacent kb_iranian_azerbaijan of contemporary kb_iran . the adr was the kb_first_trimester kb_modern_history kb_parliamentary_republic in the kb_muslim_world . among the important accomplishments of the kb_parliamentary_democracy was the kb_extension_(kinesiology) of kb_suffrage to women , making kb_azerbaijan the kb_first_trimester kb_muslim nation to kb_ulysses_s._grant women equal kb_politics kb_catalan_constitutions with men . another important accomplishment of adr was the establishment of kb_baku_state_university kb_aarhus_university by kb_march 1920 , kb_it was obvious that kb_russian_soviet_federative_socialist_republic would attack kb_baku . kb_vladimir_lenin lenin said that the invasion was justified as kb_russian_soviet_federative_socialist_republic could not survive without kb_baku 's kb_palm_oil . independent kb_azerbaijan lasted only 23 months until the kb_bolshevik kb_11th_soviet_red_army kb_soviet_union kb_red_army invaded kb_it , establishing the kb_azerbaijan_soviet_socialist_republic on 28 april 1920. although the bulk of the newly formed kb_azerbaijani_language kb_british_army was engaged in putting down an kb_armenian_language kb_history_of_the_albanian-turkish_wars that had just broken out in kb_karabakh , kb_azerbaijani_people did not surrender their brief kb_independence of 1918–20 quickly or easily . as many as 20,000 kb_azerbaijani_language soldiers died resisting what was effectively kb_a kb_russian_alphabet reconquest .on kb_boron_group kb_october 1921 , the kb_soviet_union republics of kb_russian_empire , kb_armenia , kb_azerbaijan , and kb_georgia_(u.s._state) signed an kb_agreement_(linguistics) with kb_turkey known

kb_republic within the kb_azerbaijan_soviet_socialist_republic by the kb_treaty_of_kars kb_kars . on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , kb_armenia was awarded the kb_region of kb_syunik_province and kb_turkey kb_draw_by_agreement to return kb_gyumri ( then known as alexandropol ) .during kb_world_war_ii ii , kb_azerbaijan played kb_a crucial role in the kb_geostrategy kb_energy_industry policy of the kb_soviet_union , with 80 percent of the kb_soviet_union 's kb_palm_oil on the kb_eastern_front_(world_war_ii) kb_being supplied by kb_baku . by the kb_decree of the kb_supreme_soviet_of_the_ussr kb_soviet_union of the kb_soviet_union in kb_february_revolution 1942 , the kb_personal_commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the kb_petroleum_industry of kb_azerbaijan were awarded

kb_anno_domini , took their boat building skills with them , and transmuted them into the kb_viking boats in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_europe .over the kb_century_(cricket) , kb_azerbaijani_language kb_art has gone through many stylistic changes . kb_azerbaijani_language kb_painting is traditionally characterized by kb_a warmth of colour and kb_light , as exemplified in the works of kb_azim_azimzade azimzade and kb_bahruz_kangarli kangarli , and kb_a preoccupation with kb_religion figures and kb_cultural_anthropology kb_motif_(literature) . kb_azerbaijani_language kb_painting enjoyed preeminence in kb_caucasus for hundreds of years , from the kb_romanesque_art and kb_ottoman_empire periods , and through the kb_soviet_union and kb_baroque periods , the latter kb_2_(number)

kb_film_industry in kb_azerbaijan dates back to 1898. in kb_fact , kb_azerbaijan was among the kb_first_trimester countries involved in kb_cinema_of_albania . therefore , kb_it 's not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in kb_baku – at the start of the 20th century , this bay town on the kb_caspian_sea was producing more than 50 percent of the kb_world 's supply of kb_palm_oil . just like today , the kb_petroleum_industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to kb_cold_working . in 1919 , during the kb_azerbaijan_democratic_republic kb_republic , kb_a kb_documentary `` the celebration of the anniversary of kb_azerbaijani_language kb_independence '' was filmed on the kb_first_trimester anniversary of kb_azerbaijan 's kb_independence from kb_russian_empire , 27 may , and premiered in june 1919 at several theatres in kb_baku . after the kb_soviet_union kb_power_(physics) was established in 1920 , nariman narimanov , kb_chairman of the revolutionary committee of kb_azerbaijan , signed kb_a kb_decree nationalizing kb_azerbaijan 's kb_film . this also influenced the creation of kb_azerbaijani_animation .in kb_albanian_parliamentary_election,_1991 , after kb_azerbaijan gained its kb_independence from the kb_soviet_union , the kb_first_trimester kb_baku international kb_film festival east-west was held in kb_baku . in december 2000 , the former

kb_primary_education goal , some amateur astronomers make contributions in doing kb_citizen_science , such as by monitoring kb_variable_stars stars , kb_double_stars stars sunspots , or occultations of stars by the kb_moon or kb_asteroids , or by discovering transient kb_astronomical events , such as comets , galactic novae or kb_supernovae in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_galaxy .amateur astronomers do not use the field of kb_astronomy as their kb_primary_education source of kb_income or support , and usually have no kb_professional_degree kb_degree_(angle) in kb_astrophysics or advanced academic kb_military_education_and_training in the kb_grammatical_subject . most kb_amateurs are beginners or hobbyists , while others have kb_a kb_high_middle_ages kb_degree_(angle) of experience in kb_astronomy and may often assist and kb_cold_working alongside professional astronomers . many astronomers have studied the kb_sky throughout kb_history in an amateur framework ; however , since kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the twentieth century , professional kb_astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy and associated activities .amateur astronomers typically view the kb_sky at night , when most celestial kb_object_relations_theory and kb_astronomical events are visible , but others observe during the daytime by viewing the kb_sun and solar eclipses . some just kb_look_(american_magazine) at the kb_sky using nothing more than their eyes or kb_binoculars , but more dedicated kb_amateurs often use portable kb_optical_telescope or kb_optical_telescope kb_situated in their kb_private_aviation or club kb_observatory . kb_amateurs can also join as members of amateur kb_astronomical_societycollectively , amateur astronomers observe kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of celestial kb_object_relations_theory and kb_phenomenon . common targets of amateur astronomers include the kb_moon , planets , stars , comets , meteor showers , and kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of deep kb_sky kb_object_relations_theory such as kb_star clusters , kb_galaxy , and nebulae . many kb_amateurs like to specialise in observing kb_particular kb_object_relations_theory , types of kb_object_relations_theory , or types of events which kb_interest them . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) branch of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy , amateur kb_astrophotography , involves the taking of photos of the night kb_sky . kb_astrophotography has become more popular with the introduction of far easier to use equipment including , kb_apple_quicktake , kb_dslr cameras and relatively sophisticated purpose built kb_high_middle_ages quality kb_charge-coupled_device cameras .most amateur astronomers kb_cold_working at visible kb_electromagnetic_spectrum , but kb_a small minority kb_experiment with kb_electromagnetic_spectrum outside the kb_visible_spectrum kb_visible_spectrum . an early pioneer of kb_radio_astronomy was kb_grote_reber reber , an amateur kb_astronomer kb_world_health_organization constructed the kb_first_trimester purpose built kb_radio_telescope in the late 1930s to follow up on the discovery of kb_radio_frequency kb_greenhouse_gas#direct_greenhouse_gas_emissions from kb_space by kb_karl_guthe_jansky jansky . non-visual kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy includes the use of kb_infrared kb_optical_filter on conventional kb_optical_telescope , and also the use of kb_radio kb_optical_telescope . some amateur astronomers use home-made kb_radio kb_optical_telescope , while others use kb_radio kb_optical_telescope that were originally built for kb_astronomical kb_research but have since been made kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance for use by kb_amateurs . the kb_one-mile_telescope kb_telescopeamateur astronomers use kb_a range of instruments to kb_science the kb_sky , depending on kb_a combination of their interests and resources . methods include simply looking at the night kb_sky with the kb_naked_eye kb_human_eye , using kb_binoculars , and using kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of optical kb_optical_telescope of varying kb_power_(physics) and quality , as kb_water_well as additional sophisticated equipment , such as cameras , to kb_science kb_light from the kb_sky in both the visual and non-visual parts of the kb_visible_spectrum . commercial kb_optical_telescope are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance , kb_new_world and used , but kb_it is also common for amateur astronomers to build ( or commission the building of ) their own custom kb_optical_telescope . some kb_people_(american_magazine) even focus on kb_amateur_telescope_making kb_telescope making as their kb_primary_education kb_interest within the kb_hobby of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy .although specialized and experienced amateur astronomers tend to acquire more specialized and more powerful equipment over kb_time_(magazine) , relatively kb_simple_polygon equipment is often preferred for certain kb_task_(computing) . kb_binoculars , for instance , although generally of lower kb_power_(physics) than the majority of kb_optical_telescope , also tend to provide kb_a wider kb_field_of_view of view , which is preferable for looking at some kb_object_relations_theory in the night kb_sky .amateur astronomers also use kb_star charts that , depending on experience and intentions , may range from kb_simple_polygon planispheres through to detailed charts of very specific areas of the night kb_sky . kb_a range of kb_astronomy software is kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance and used by amateur astronomers , including software that generates maps of the kb_sky , software to assist with kb_astrophotography , kb_observation scheduling software , and software to perform various calculations pertaining to kb_astronomical kb_phenomenon .amateur astronomers often like to keep kb_record_(computer_science) of their kb_observations_(pierre_belon) , which usually takes the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of an observing log . observing logs typically record details about which kb_object_relations_theory were observed and when , as kb_water_well as describing the details that were seen . sketching is sometimes used within logs , and photographic kb_record_(computer_science) of kb_observations_(pierre_belon) have also been used in recent times . the kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) gathered is used to help studies and kb_interaction_(statistics) between amateur astronomers in yearly gatherings . although not professional kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) or credible , kb_it is kb_a way for the kb_hobby lovers to share their kb_new_world sightings and experiences .kb_the_internet kb_internet is an kb_essential_element kb_tool of amateur astronomers . the popularity of imaging among kb_amateurs has kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of kb_world_wide_web sites kb_being written by individuals about their images and equipment . much of the kb_social_interaction of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy occurs on kb_mailing_lists lists or discussion kb_group_(mathematics) . discussion kb_group_(periodic_table) servers host numerous kb_astronomy lists . kb_a great deal of the commerce of kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy , the buying and selling of equipment , occurs online . many kb_amateurs use online tools to plan their nightly observing sessions , using tools such as the kb_clear_sky_chart kb_sky chart .while kb_a kb_grammatical_number of interesting celestial kb_object_relations_theory are readily kb_interpretatio_graeca by the kb_naked_eye kb_human_eye , sometimes with the kb_aid of kb_a kb_star_chart , many others are kb_sulfate faint or inconspicuous that technical means are necessary to locate them . although many methods are used in kb_amateur_astronomy kb_astronomy , most are variations of kb_a few specific techniques .kb_star hopping is kb_a method often used by amateur astronomers with low-tech equipment such as kb_binoculars or kb_a manually driven kb_telescope . kb_it involves the use of maps ( or kb_memory ) to locate known landmark stars , and `` hopping '' between them , often with the kb_aid of kb_a kb_finderscope . because of its simplicity , kb_star hopping is kb_a very common method for finding kb_object_relations_theory that are close to naked-eye stars .more advanced methods of locating kb_object_relations_theory in the kb_sky include kb_telescope mounts with `` kb_setting_circles circles '' , which assist with pointing kb_optical_telescope to positions in the kb_sky that are known to contain kb_object_relations_theory of kb_interest , and `` goto kb_optical_telescope '' , which are fully kb_automated kb_optical_telescope that are capable of locating kb_object_relations_theory on demand ( having kb_first_trimester been kb_calibration ) .the kb_advent of kb_battle_of_mobile_(1781) applications for use in kb_smartphones has kb_light-emitting_diode to the creation of many dedicated apps . these apps allow any kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) to easily locate celestial kb_object_relations_theory of kb_interest by simply pointing the kb_smartphone kb_analyzer in that direction in the kb_sky . these apps make use of the inbuilt kb_computer_hardware in the phone , such as kb_gps kb_location_(sign_language) and kb_gyroscope . useful kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) about the pointed kb_space_debris like kb_celestial_coordinates coordinates , the kb_toponymy of the kb_space_debris , its kb_constellation , etc . are provided for kb_a quick reference . some paid versions give more kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) . these apps are gradually getting into regular use during observing , for the alignment process of kb_optical_telescope .kb_setting_circles circles are kb_angular_measurement measurement kb_fish_scale that can kb_beryllium placed on the kb_2_(number) main kb_rotation_around_a_fixed_axis of some kb_optical_telescope . since the widespread adoption of kb_digital_data kb_setting_circles circles , any kb_classical_conditioning engraved setting kb_circle is now specifically kb_interpretatio_graeca as an `` kb_analog_device setting kb_circle '' ( asc ) . by knowing the coordinates of an kb_space_debris ( usually given in kb_equatorial_coordinates coordinates ) , the kb_telescope kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) can use the setting kb_circle to align ( i.e. , point ) the kb_telescope in the appropriate direction before looking through its kb_eyepiece . kb_a computerized setting kb_circle is called kb_a `` kb_digital_data setting kb_circle '' ( dsc ) . although kb_digital_data kb_setting_circles circles can kb_beryllium used to kb_computer_monitor kb_a kb_telescope 's kb_radium and kb_declination coordinates , they are not simply kb_a kb_digital_data read-out of what can kb_beryllium seen on the kb_telescope 's kb_analog_device kb_setting_circles circles . as with go-to kb_optical_telescope , kb_digital_data setting kb_circle computers ( commercial names include kb_argo navis , kb_sky commander , and ngc max ) contain databases of tens of thousands of celestial kb_object_relations_theory and projections of kb_planet positions .to find kb_a celestial kb_space_debris in kb_a kb_telescope equipped with kb_a dsc kb_apollo_guidance_computer , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) does not need to kb_look_(american_magazine) up the specific kb_radium and kb_declination coordinates in kb_a book or kb_other_(philosophy) resource , and then adjust the kb_telescope to those numerical readings . rather , the kb_space_debris is chosen from the kb_electronic_computer database , which kb_causes_of_autism kb_distance values and kb_arrow_(weapon) markers to appear in the kb_computer_monitor that indicate the kb_distance and direction to move the kb_telescope . the kb_telescope is moved until the kb_2_(number) angular kb_distance values reach kb_0_(number) , indicating that the kb_telescope is properly aligned . when both the kb_radium and kb_declination axes are thus `` zeroed out '' , the kb_space_debris should kb_beryllium in the kb_eyepiece . many dscs , like go-to kb_systems_analysis , can also kb_cold_working in conjunction with laptop kb_sky programs .computerized kb_systems_analysis provide the further advantage of kb_computing kb_coordinate kb_precession . traditional printed sources are subtitled by the `` kb_epoch_(astronomy) '' year , which refers to the positions of celestial kb_object_relations_theory at kb_a given kb_time_(magazine) to the nearest year ( e.g. , j2005 , j2007 ) . most such printed sources have been updated for intervals of only about every fifty years ( e.g. , j1900 , j1950 , j2000 ) . computerized sources , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , are able to calculate the kb_right_ascension and kb_declination of the `` kb_epoch_(astronomy) of date '' to the exact instant of kb_observation .goto kb_optical_telescope have become more popular since the 1980s as kb_technology has improved and prices have been kb_redox . with these computer-driven kb_optical_telescope , the kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) typically enters the kb_toponymy of the item of kb_interest and the kb_mechanics of the kb_telescope point the kb_telescope towards that item automatically . they have several notable advantages for amateur astronomers intent on kb_research . for example , goto kb_optical_telescope tend to kb_beryllium faster for locating items of kb_interest than kb_star hopping , allowing more kb_time_(magazine) for studying of the kb_space_debris . goto also allows manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler alt-azimuth kb_telescope mounts , allowing them to produce an overall less expensive kb_decay_product . goto kb_optical_telescope usually have to kb_beryllium kb_calibration using alignment stars in kb_order_(biology) to provide accurate tracking and positioning . however , several kb_telescope manufacturers have recently kb_adaptation kb_telescope kb_systems_analysis that are kb_calibration with the use of built-in kb_gps , decreasing the kb_time_(magazine) kb_it takes to kb_set_(mythology) up kb_a kb_telescope at the start of an observing session .with the development of fast kb_internet in the last part of the 20th century along with advances in kb_apollo_guidance_computer controlled kb_telescope mounts and kb_charge-coupled_device cameras `` remote kb_telescope '' kb_astronomy is now kb_a viable means for amateur astronomers not aligned with kb_major_(united_states) kb_telescope facilities to partake in kb_research and deep kb_sky imaging . this enables anyone to control kb_a kb_telescope kb_a great kb_distance away in kb_a dark kb_location_(sign_language) . the observer can image through the kb_telescope using kb_charge-coupled_device cameras . the kb_digital_data kb_big_data collected by the kb_telescope is then transmitted and displayed to the kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) by means of kb_the_internet kb_internet . an example of kb_a

often not the `` main '' goal for many amateur astronomers , unlike professional astronomers . kb_cold_working of kb_scientific_method merit is possible , however , and many kb_amateurs successfully contribute to the kb_knowledge_representation kb_base_(chemistry) of professional astronomers . kb_astronomy is sometimes promoted as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the few remaining kb_sciences for which kb_amateurs can still contribute useful kb_big_data . to recognize this , the kb_astronomical_society_of_the_pacific of the kb_pacific_ocean annually gives kb_amateur_achievement_award_of_astronomical_society_of_the_pacific achievement awards for significant contributions to kb_astronomy by kb_amateurs .the majority of kb_scientific_method contributions by amateur astronomers are in the kb_area of kb_big_data kb_class_(set_theory) . in kb_particular , this applies where kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of amateur astronomers with small kb_optical_telescope are more effective than the relatively small kb_grammatical_number of kb_prespa_lake kb_optical_telescope that are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance to professional astronomers . several organizations , such as the kb_american_association_of_variable_star_observers of kb_variable_star kb_star observers , exist to help kb_coordinate these contributions .amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of kb_variable_stars stars and kb_supernovae , helping to track kb_asteroids , and observing occultations to determine both the kb_shape of kb_asteroids and the kb_shape of the kb_terrain_(journal) on the apparent kb_enhanced_data_rates_for_gsm_evolution of the kb_moon as seen from kb_earth . with more advanced

kb_major_(united_states) role in discovering kb_new_world comets . recently however , funding of projects such as the kb_linear kb_asteroid kb_research and kb_near_earth_asteroid_tracking kb_earth kb_asteroid tracking projects has meant that most comets are now discovered by kb_automated kb_systems_analysis kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) before kb_it is possible for kb_amateurs to

kb_citizen_scienceaikido 's techniques include : kb_irimi ( entering ) , and kb_tenkan ( turning ) movements ( that redirect the opponent 's attack kb_momentum ) , various types of kb_throw_(grappling) and joint locks .aikido derives mainly from the kb_martial_art kb_art of kb_daitō-ryū_aiki-jūjutsu aiki-jūjutsu , but began to diverge from kb_it in the late 1920s , partly due to ueshiba 's involvement with the kb_oomotokb_the_word_(free_love) word `` aikido '' is formed of kb_triliteral kb_kanji :the kb_terminology `` kb_aiki_(martial_arts_principle) '' does not readily appear in the kb_japanese_language kb_language outside the kb_scope_(mouthwash) of kb_budō . this has kb_light-emitting_diode to many possible interpretations of kb_the_word_(free_love) word .the kb_terminology is also found in kb_martial_arts kb_arts such as kb_judo and kb_kendo , and in various non-martial kb_arts , such as kb_japanese_calligraphy ( ) , kb_ikebana ( ) and kb_japanese_tea_ceremonyueshiba kb_adaptation aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older kb_martial_arts kb_arts that kb_he_(letter) had studied . the core kb_martial_art kb_art from which aikido derives is kb_daitō-ryū_aiki-jūjutsu aiki-jūjutsu , which ueshiba studied directly with kb_takeda_sōkaku sōkaku , the reviver of that kb_art . additionally , ueshiba is known to have studied kb_tenjin_shinyo_ryu shin'yō-ryū with tozawa tokusaburō in kb_tokyo in 1901 , kb_yagyū_shingan-ryū yagyū shingan-ryū under nakai masakatsu in kb_sakai,_osaka from 1903 to 1908 , and kb_judo with kiyoichi takagi ( , 1894–1972 ) in kb_tanabe in kb_1911_in_argentine_football .the kb_art of daitō-ryū is the kb_primary_education technical influence on aikido . along with empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques , ueshiba incorporated kb_military_education_and_training movements with weapons , such as those for the kb_spear ( ) , short kb_stick_fighting ( ) , and perhaps the . however , aikido derives much of its technical kb_structure from the kb_art of swordsmanship ( ) .ueshiba moved to kb_hokkaidōafter ueshiba kb_left-wing_politics kb_hokkaidō in 1919 , kb_he_(letter) kb_methionine and was profoundly influenced by kb_onisaburo_deguchi deguchi , the kb_spirituality kb_leader of the kb_oomoto kb_religion ( kb_a neo-shinto kb_movement_(sign_language) ) in kb_ayabe . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_primary_education features of kb_oomoto is its kb_emphasis_(typography) on the attainment of kb_utopia during kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's kb_life_(magazine) . this was kb_a great influence on ueshiba 's kb_martial_arts kb_arts kb_philosophy of extending kb_love and compassion especially to those kb_world_health_organization seek to harm others . aikido demonstrates this kb_philosophy in its kb_emphasis_(typography) on mastering kb_martial_arts kb_arts kb_sulfate that kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect kb_it . in an kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_optical_resolution , not only is the receiver unharmed , but kb_sulfate is the attacker .in kb_addition to the effect on kb_histidine kb_spirituality growth , the connection with deguchi gave ueshiba kb_azerbaijan_in_the_eurovision_song_contest_2009 to elite kb_politics and kb_military circles as kb_a martial kb_artist . as kb_a result of this exposure , kb_he_(letter) was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students . several of these students would found their own kb_art_movement of aikido .aikido was kb_first_trimester brought to the rest of the kb_world in kb_1951_in_literature by kb_minoru_mochizuki mochizuki with kb_a visit to kb_france where kb_he_(letter) introduced aikido techniques to kb_judo students . kb_he_(letter) was followed by kb_tadashi_abe abe in 1952 , kb_world_health_organization came as the official kb_aikikai_hombu hombu representative , remaining in kb_france for seven years . kb_kenji_tomiki tomiki toured with kb_a delegation of various kb_martial_arts kb_arts through 15 kb_continental_dollar kb_sovereign_state of the united kb_sovereign_state in 1953. later that year , kb_koichi_tohei tohei was sent by kb_aikikai_hombu hombu to kb_hawaii for kb_a full year , where kb_he_(letter) kb_set_(mythology) up several kb_dojo . this trip was followed by several further visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the united kb_sovereign_state . the kb_united_kingdom kb_kingdom_(biology) followed in 1955 ; kb_italy in kb_united_states_presidential_election,_1964 by kb_hiroshi_tada tada ; and kb_germany in 1965 by kb_katsuaki_asai asai . designated `` official delegate for kb_europe and kb_africa '' by morihei ueshiba , kb_masamichi_noro noro arrived in kb_france in september 1961. kb_seiichi_sugano sugano was appointed to introduce aikido to kb_australia in 1965. today there are aikido kb_dojo throughout the kb_world .the kb_largest_organisms aikido organization is the kb_aikikai_foundation kb_foundation_(engineering) , which remains under the control of the ueshiba kb_family_(biology) . however , aikido has many kb_art_movement , mostly formed by morihei ueshiba 's kb_major_(united_states) students .the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century independent kb_art_movement to emerge were kb_yoseikan_aikido aikido , begun by kb_minoru_mochizuki mochizuki in 1931 , kb_yoshinkan , founded by kb_gozo_shioda in 1955 , and kb_shodokan_aikido aikido , founded by kb_kenji_tomiki tomiki in 1967. the emergence of these kb_art_movement pre-dated ueshiba 's kb_death and did not cause any kb_major_(united_states) upheavals when they were formalized . kb_shodokan_aikido aikido , however , was controversial , since kb_it introduced kb_a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the kb_spirit of aikido .after ueshiba 's kb_death in 1969 , kb_2_(number) more kb_major_(united_states) kb_art_movement kb_declaration_of_independence_of_albania . significant kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war arose with the departure of the kb_aikikai_hombu_dojo kb_dojo 's kb_tribal_chief instructor kb_koichi_tohei tohei , in 1974. tohei kb_left-wing_politics as kb_a result of kb_a disagreement with the son of the founder , kb_kisshomaru_ueshiba ueshiba , kb_world_health_organization at that kb_time_(magazine) headed the kb_aikikai_foundation kb_foundation_(engineering) . the disagreement was over the proper role of `` kb_qi '' development in regular aikido kb_military_education_and_training . after tohei kb_left-wing_politics , kb_he_(letter) formed kb_histidine own kb_carpel , called kb_shin_shin_toitsu_aikido shin toitsu aikido , and the organization that governs kb_it , the kb_ki_society ( `` kb_qi no kenkyūkai '' ) .kb_a final kb_major_(united_states) kb_carpel kb_evolution_of_tetrapods from ueshiba 's retirement in iwama , ibaraki and the teaching kb_methodology of kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_terminology student kb_morihiro_saito saito . kb_it is unofficially referred to as the `` kb_iwama_style kb_carpel '' , and at kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) point kb_a kb_grammatical_number of its followers formed kb_a loose network of schools they called kb_iwama_ryu ryu . although kb_iwama_style kb_carpel practitioners remained part of the aikikai until saito 's kb_death in kb_2002_australian_open , followers of saito subsequently split into kb_2_(number) kb_group_(mathematics) . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) remained with the aikikai and the kb_other_(philosophy) formed the independent kb_shinshin_aikishuren_kai aikishuren kai in kb_2004_summer_olympics around saito 's son kb_hitohiro_saito saitothe kb_science of `` kb_qi '' is an important component of aikido , and its kb_science defies categorization as either `` kb_health '' or `` kb_mental_health '' kb_military_education_and_training , as kb_it encompasses both . the `` kb_kanji '' for `` kb_qi '' normally is written as . kb_it was written as until the kb_tōyō_kanji reforms after kb_world_war_ii ii , and this older kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism still is seen on occasion .the kb_character_(computing) for `` kb_qi '' is used in everyday kb_japanese_language terms , such as , or . `` kb_qi '' has many meanings , including `` ambience '' , `` kb_mind '' , `` mood '' , and `` intention '' , however , in traditional kb_martial_arts kb_arts kb_it is often used to refer to `` kb_life_(magazine) kb_energy_industry '' . kb_gozo_shioda shioda 's kb_yoshinkan , considered kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the `` hard kb_art_movement '' , largely follows ueshiba 's teachings from before kb_world_war_ii ii , and surmises that the secret to `` kb_qi '' lies in timing and the kb_application_(computing) of the whole kb_human_body 's kb_strength_of_materials to kb_a kb_single_bond point . in later years , ueshiba 's kb_application_(computing) of `` kb_qi '' in aikido took on kb_a softer , more gentle kb_sentience . this was kb_histidine kb_takemusu kb_aiki_(martial_arts_principle) and many of kb_histidine later students teach about `` kb_qi '' from this perspective . kb_koichi_tohei tohei 's kb_ki_society centers almost exclusively around the kb_science of the kb_empirical_evidence ( albeit subjective ) experience of `` kb_qi '' with students kb_historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_united_states#scholar_survey_results separately in aikido techniques and `` kb_qi '' development .in aikido , as in virtually all kb_japanese_language kb_martial_arts kb_arts , there are both kb_health and kb_mental_health aspects of kb_military_education_and_training . the kb_health kb_military_education_and_training in aikido is diverse , covering both kb_general_(united_states) kb_health kb_fitness_(biology) and kb_physical_exercise , as kb_water_well as specific techniques . because kb_a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of kb_throw_(grappling) , beginners learn how to safely fall or roll . the specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs ; the techniques for kb_defense_(legal) consist of kb_throw_(grappling) and kb_pinning_holdkb_health kb_military_education_and_training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled kb_relaxation_technique , correct kb_movement_(sign_language) of joints such as hips and shoulders , kb_flexibility_(anatomy) , and kb_endurance , with less kb_emphasis_(typography) on kb_strength_training . in aikido , pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements . this distinction can kb_beryllium kb_applied_science to kb_general_(united_states) kb_fitness_(biology) goals for the aikido practitioner .in aikido , specific muscles or kb_muscle kb_group_(mathematics) are not kb_isolationism and worked to improve kb_tone_(linguistics) , kb_mass_(liturgy) , or kb_power_(physics) . aikido-related kb_military_education_and_training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body kb_movement_(sign_language) and kb_formal_balance similar to kb_yoga or kb_pilates . for example , many dojos begin each kb_class_(biology) with , which may include kb_stretching and kb_uke_(martial_arts) ( break falls ) .aikido kb_military_education_and_training is based primarily on kb_2_(number) partners practicing pre-arranged kb_theory_of_forms ( `` kb_kata '' ) rather than freestyle practice . the kb_base_(chemistry) kb_pattern is for the receiver of the technique ( `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' ) to initiate an attack against the kb_grammatical_person kb_world_health_organization applies the technique—the `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , or `` shite '' ( depending on aikido kb_carpel ) , also referred to as `` nage '' ( when applying kb_a throwing technique ) , kb_world_health_organization neutralises this attack with an aikido technique .both halves of the technique , that of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' and that of `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , are considered kb_essential_element to aikido kb_military_education_and_training . both are studying aikido principles of blending and kb_adaptation . `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' learns to blend with and control attacking kb_energy_industry , while `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous , off-balance positions in which `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' places them . this `` receiving '' of the technique is called `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' . `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' continuously seeks to regain kb_formal_balance and cover vulnerabilities ( e.g. , an exposed side ) , while `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' uses kb_positional_notation and timing to keep `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' off-balance and vulnerable . in more advanced kb_military_education_and_training , `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' kb_will_and_testament sometimes apply to regain kb_formal_balance and pin or kb_throw_(grappling) `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' .aikido techniques are usually kb_a kb_defense_(legal) against an attack , kb_sulfate students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to kb_beryllium able to practice aikido with kb_a partner . although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based kb_arts , sincere attacks ( kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_strike_action or an immobilizing grab ) are needed to kb_science correct and effective kb_application_(computing) of technique .many of the of aikido resemble cuts from kb_a kb_sword or kb_other_(philosophy) grasped kb_space_debris , which indicate its origins in techniques kb_intention for kb_weapon kb_combat_(newspaper) . kb_other_(philosophy) techniques , which explicitly appear to kb_beryllium punches ( `` kb_tsuki '' ) , are practiced as thrusts with kb_a kb_knife or kb_sword . kicks are generally reserved for upper-level variations ; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous , and that kicks ( kb_high_middle_ages kicks in kb_particular ) were uncommon during the types of kb_combat_(newspaper) prevalent in kb_feudal kb_japan . some kb_base_(chemistry) strikes include :beginners in kb_particular often practice techniques from grabs , both because they are safer and because kb_it is easier to kb_sentience the kb_energy_industry and lines of kb_force of kb_a hold than kb_a kb_strike_action . some grabs are kb_history kb_derived_trait from kb_being held while trying to draw kb_a kb_katanaaikido makes use of kb_human_body kb_movement_(sign_language) ( `` kb_tai_sabaki sabaki '' ) to blend with `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' . for example , an `` entering '' ( `` kb_irimi '' ) technique consists of movements inward towards `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , while kb_a technique uses kb_a pivoting kb_motion_(physics) .additionally , an technique takes kb_place_of_articulation in front of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , whereas an technique takes kb_place_of_articulation to their side ; kb_a technique is kb_applied_science with kb_motion_(physics) to the front of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , and kb_a version is kb_applied_science with kb_motion_(physics) towards the rear of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' , usually by incorporating kb_a turning or pivoting kb_motion_(physics) . finally , most techniques can kb_beryllium performed while in kb_a seated posture ( `` kb_seiza '' ) . techniques where both `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' and `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' are standing are called `` tachi-waza '' , techniques where both start off in `` kb_seiza '' are called `` suwari-waza '' , and techniques performed with `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' standing and `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' sitting are called `` hanmi handachi '' ( ) .thus , from fewer than twenty kb_base_(chemistry) techniques , there are thousands of possible implementations . for instance , `` ikkyō '' can kb_beryllium kb_applied_science to an opponent moving forward with kb_a kb_strike_action ( perhaps with an `` ura '' kb_type_(biology) of kb_movement_(sign_language) to redirect the incoming kb_force ) , or to an opponent kb_world_health_organization has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish kb_distance ( perhaps an `` omote-waza '' version ) . specific aikido `` kb_kata '' are typically referred to with the kb_chemical_formula `` attack-technique ( -modifier ) '' . for instance , `` katate-dori ikkyō '' refers to any `` ikkyō '' technique kb_execution_(computing) when `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' is holding kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_wrist . this could kb_beryllium further specified as `` katate-dori ikkyō omote '' , referring to any forward-moving `` ikkyō '' technique from that grab .`` kb_atemi '' ( ) are strikes ( or feints ) employed during an aikido technique . some view `` kb_atemi '' as attacks against `` kb_pressure_point points '' meant to cause damage in and of themselves . for instance , kb_gozo_shioda shiodaweapons kb_military_education_and_training in aikido traditionally includes the short kb_stick_fighting ( `` kb_jō '' ) although its techniques resemble closely the use of the bayonet or kb_jūkendō , the wooden kb_sword ( `` kb_bokken '' ) , and the kb_knife ( `` kb_tantō '' ) . some schools incorporate firearm-disarming techniques . both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are taught . some schools , such as the kb_iwama_style kb_carpel of kb_morihiro_saito saito , usually spend substantial kb_time_(magazine) practicing with both `` kb_bokken '' and `` kb_jō '' , under the names of `` kb_aiki-ken '' , and `` kb_aiki-jō '' , respectively .the founder kb_adaptation many of the empty-handed techniques from traditional kb_sword , kb_spear and bayonet movements . consequently , the practice of the weapons kb_arts gives insight into the kb_evolution of techniques and movements , and reinforces the concepts of kb_distance , timing , kb_hiking kb_movement_(sign_language) , presence and connectedness with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's kb_military_education_and_training partner ( kb_sulfur ) .kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_i_shot_andy_warhol of aikido is kb_military_education_and_training to defend against kb_cross-platform_software attackers , often called `` taninzudori '' , or `` taninzugake '' . freestyle practice with kb_cross-platform_software attackers called `` kb_randori '' ( ) is kb_a kb_key_(cryptography) part of most curricula and is required for the higher level ranks . `` kb_randori '' exercises kb_a kb_grammatical_person 's ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment . kb_geostrategy kb_utility of techniques , based on how they reposition the student relative to kb_other_(philosophy) attackers , is important in `` kb_randori '' kb_military_education_and_training . for instance , an `` ura '' technique might kb_beryllium used to neutralise the kb_electric_current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind .in kb_shodokan_aikido aikido , `` kb_randori '' differs in that kb_it is not performed with kb_cross-platform_software persons with kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity roles of kb_defender_(video_game) and attacker , but between kb_2_(number) kb_people_(american_magazine) , where both participants attack , defend , and counter at kb_will_and_testament . in this respect kb_it resembles kb_judo `` kb_randori '' .in applying kb_a technique during kb_military_education_and_training , kb_it is the responsibility of `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' to prevent kb_injury to `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' by employing kb_a speed and kb_force of kb_application_(computing) that is commensurate with their partner 's proficiency in `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' . kb_injuries ( especially those to the joints ) , when they do occur in aikido , are often the result of `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' misjudging the ability of `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' to receive the kb_throw_(grappling) or pin .kb_a kb_science of kb_injuries in the kb_martial_arts kb_arts showed that the kb_type_(biology) of kb_injuries varied considerably from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_art to the kb_other_(philosophy) .kb_hardness kb_tissue_(biology) kb_injuries are kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the most common types of kb_injuries found within aikido , as kb_water_well as joint kb_strain_(biology) and stubbed fingers and toes . several kb_maternal_death from head-and-neck kb_injuries , caused by aggressive `` shihōnage '' in kb_a kb_senpai_and_kōhaiaikido practitioners ( commonly called `` aikidōka '' outside kb_japan ) generally progress by promotion through kb_a series of `` kb_grade_(education) '' ( `` kb_kyū '' ) , followed by kb_a series of `` kb_degree_(angle) '' ( `` kb_dan_(rank) '' ) , pursuant to formal testing procedures . some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners ' kb_grade_(education) , often simply kb_white_american and kb_black_belt_(martial_arts) to distinguish `` kyu '' and `` kb_dan_(rank) '' kb_grade_(education) , though some use various belt colors . testing kb_requirement_analysis vary , kb_sulfate kb_a kb_particular rank in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another . some dojos do not allow students to kb_take the test to obtain kb_a `` kb_dan_(rank) '' rank unless they are 16 or older .the uniform worn for practicing aikido ( `` kb_aikidogi '' ) is similar to the kb_military_education_and_training uniform ( `` kb_keikogi '' ) used in most kb_other_(philosophy) kb_modern_history kb_martial_arts kb_arts ; kb_simple_polygon trousers and kb_a wraparound jacket , usually kb_white_american . both thick ( `` judo-style '' ) , and thin ( `` karate-style '' ) kb_cotton tops are used . aikido-specific tops are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance with shorter sleeves which reach to just kb_#ecclesiastical_history the kb_elbow_river .most aikido kb_systems_analysis add kb_a pair of wide pleated kb_black_sea or kb_indigo trousers called kb_a `` kb_hakama '' ( used also in kb_naginatajutsu , kb_kendo , and kb_iaido ) . in many schools , its use is reserved for practitioners with ( `` kb_dan_(rank) '' ) ranks or for instructors , while others allow all practitioners to wear kb_a `` kb_hakama '' regardless of rank .the most common criticism of aikido is that kb_it suffers from kb_a lack of kb_metaphysical_realism in kb_military_education_and_training . the attacks initiated by `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' ( and which `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' must defend against ) have been criticized as kb_being `` weak '' , `` sloppy '' , and `` little more than caricatures of an attack '' .weak attacks from `` kb_uke_(martial_arts) '' allow for kb_a conditioned response from `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners . to counteract this , some kb_art_movement allow students to become less compliant over kb_time_(magazine) but , in keeping with the core philosophies , this is after having demonstrated proficiency in kb_being able to protect themselves and their kb_military_education_and_training partners . kb_shodokan_aikido aikido addresses the issue by practising in kb_a competitive kb_text_formatting . such adaptations are debated between kb_art_movement , with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified , or that they are not kb_military_education_and_training for self-defense or kb_combat_(newspaper) effectiveness , but kb_spirituality , kb_fitness_(biology) or kb_other_(philosophy) reasons .another criticism pertains to the kb_shift_code in kb_military_education_and_training focus after the end of ueshiba 's seclusion in iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s , as kb_he_(letter) increasingly emphasized the kb_spirituality and kb_philosophy aspects of aikido . as kb_a result , strikes to kb_pressure_point points by `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , entering ( `` kb_irimi '' ) and initiation of techniques by `` kb_tori_(martial_arts) '' , the distinction between `` omote '' ( front side ) and `` ura '' ( back side ) techniques , and the use of weapons , were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice . some aikido practitioners kb_sentience that lack of kb_military_education_and_training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness .conversely , some kb_art_movement of aikido receive criticism for not placing enough importance on the kb_spirituality practices emphasized by ueshiba . according to minoru shibata of aikido kb_academic_journal , `` o-sensei 's aikido was not kb_a continuation and kb_extension_(kinesiology) of the kb_old_testament and has kb_a distinct discontinuity

'' kb_australian_english kb_lexical_semantics kb_derived_trait from this kb_meaning_(linguistics) include `` artifact '' , `` artificial '' , `` artifice '' , `` kb_medical_abortion kb_arts '' , and `` kb_military kb_arts '' . however , there are many kb_other_(philosophy) colloquial uses of kb_the_word_(free_love) word , all with some relation to its kb_etymologyover kb_time_(magazine) , kb_philosopher like kb_plato , kb_aristotle , kb_socrates and kb_immanuel_kant , among others , questioned the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of kb_art . several dialogues in kb_plato tackle questions about kb_art : kb_socrates says that kb_poetry is inspired by the kb_muses , and is not kb_rational_number . kb_he_(letter) speaks approvingly of this , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_theory_of_forms of kb_divinity madness ( drunkenness , eroticism , and dreaming ) in the `` kb_phaedrus_(plato) `` ( 265a–c ) , and yet in the `` '' kb_republic '' '' wants to kb_outlaw kb_homer 's great kb_poetic_edda kb_art , and laughter as kb_water_well . in `` kb_ion '' , kb_socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of kb_homer that kb_he_(letter) expresses in the `` kb_republic '' . the kb_dialogue `` kb_ion '' suggests that kb_homer 's `` kb_iliad '' functioned in the kb_ancient_greek kb_world as the kb_bible does today in the kb_modern_history kb_christianity kb_world : as divinely inspired literary kb_art that can provide kb_morality guidance , if only kb_it can kb_beryllium properly interpreted .with regards to the literary kb_art and the musical kb_arts , kb_aristotle considered kb_epic_poetry , tragedy , comedy , kb_dithyramb kb_poetry and kb_music to kb_beryllium kb_mimesis or imitative kb_art , each varying in imitation by kb_list_of_art_mediums , kb_space_debris , and manner . for example , kb_music imitates with the kb_medes of kb_rhythm and kb_harmony , whereas kb_dance imitates with kb_rhythm alone , and kb_poetry with kb_language . the kb_theory_of_forms also differ in their kb_space_debris of imitation . comedy , for instance , is kb_a dramatic imitation of men worse than average ; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average . lastly , the kb_theory_of_forms differ in their manner of imitation—through kb_narrative or kb_character_(computing) , through change or no change , and through drama or no drama . kb_aristotle believed that imitation is kb_natural_number to mankind and constitutes kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of mankind 's advantages over kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing .the kb_second , and more recent , kb_word_sense of kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_art '' as an abbreviation for `` kb_creativity kb_art '' or `` kb_fine_art '' kb_declaration_of_independence_of_albania in the early 17th century . kb_fine_art refers to kb_a skill used to express the kb_artist 's creativity , or to engage the audience 's kb_aesthetic sensibilities , or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or `` finer '' kb_cold_working of kb_art .within this latter kb_word_sense , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_art '' may refer to several things : ( kb_iodine ) kb_a kb_science of kb_a kb_creativity skill , ( ii ) kb_a process of using the kb_creativity skill , ( iii ) kb_a kb_decay_product of the kb_creativity skill , or ( iv ) the audience 's experience with the kb_creativity skill . the kb_creativity kb_arts ( `` kb_art '' as discipline ) are kb_a kb_class_(set_theory) of disciplines which produce `` kb_artworks '' ( `` kb_art '' as kb_object_relations_theory ) that are compelled by kb_a kb_personal_property drive ( kb_art as activity ) and convey kb_a message , mood , or kb_symbolism_(arts) for the perceiver to interpret ( kb_art as experience ) . kb_art is something that stimulates an kb_individual 's thoughts , emotions , kb_orthodoxy , or kb_idea through the senses . works of kb_art can kb_beryllium explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of images or kb_object_relations_theory . for some scholars , such as kb_immanuel_kant , the kb_sciences and kb_the_arts kb_arts could kb_beryllium distinguished by taking kb_science as representing the domain of kb_knowledge_representation and kb_the_arts kb_arts as representing the domain of the kb_freedom of artistic expression .often , if the skill is kb_being used in kb_a common or practical way , kb_people_(american_magazine) kb_will_and_testament consider kb_it kb_a kb_craft instead of kb_art . likewise , if the skill is kb_being used in kb_a commercial or industrial way , kb_it may kb_beryllium considered kb_commercial_art kb_art instead of kb_fine_art . on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , crafts and design are sometimes considered kb_applied_art . some kb_art followers have argued that the difference between kb_fine_art and kb_applied_art has more to do with kb_lightness judgments made about the kb_art than any clear definitional difference . however , even kb_fine_art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression . the purpose of works of kb_art may kb_beryllium to communicate kb_idea , such as in kb_politics_of_albania , spiritually , or philosophically motivated kb_art ; to create kb_a kb_word_sense of kb_beauty ( kb_episcopal_see kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics ) ; to explore the kb_nature of kb_machine_perception ; for kb_pleasure ; or to generate kb_strong_nuclear_force emotions . the purpose may also kb_beryllium seemingly nonexistent .the kb_nature of kb_art has been described by kb_philosophy kb_richard_wollheim wollheim as `` kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the most elusive of the traditional kb_problems_(aristotle) of kb_human kb_albanian_culture '' . kb_art has been kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as kb_a kb_space_vehicle for the expression or kb_communication of emotions and kb_idea , kb_a means for kb_exploring and appreciating kb_formalism_(art) kb_chemical_element for their own sake , and as `` kb_mimesis '' or kb_representation_(arts) . kb_art as kb_mimesis has deep kb_semitic_root in the kb_philosophy of kb_aristotle . kb_leo_tolstoy tolstoy kb_interpretatio_graeca kb_art as kb_a use of indirect means to communicate from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_grammatical_person to another . kb_benedetto_croce croce and r.g . collingwood advanced the kb_idealism view that kb_art expresses emotions , and that the kb_cold_working of kb_art therefore essentially exists in the kb_mind of the creator . the kb_theory of kb_art as kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism has its kb_semitic_root in the kb_philosophy of kb_immanuel_kant , and was kb_adaptation in the early twentieth century by kb_roger_fry fry and kb_clive_bell kb_bell . more recently , thinkers influenced by kb_martin_heidegger heidegger have interpreted kb_art as the means by which kb_a kb_community develops for itself kb_a kb_list_of_art_mediums for self-expression and kb_interpretation_(logic) . kb_george_dickie_(philosopher) has offered an kb_institutional_theory_of_art kb_theory of kb_art that defines kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art as any artifact upon which kb_a qualified kb_grammatical_person or persons acting on behalf of the kb_social_anarchism institution commonly referred to as `` the kb_art_world '' has conferred `` the status of candidate for appreciation '' . larry shiner has described kb_fine_art as `` not an kb_essence or kb_a fate but something we have made . kb_art as we have generally understood kb_it is kb_a kb_european_eel invention barely kb_2_(number) hundred years kb_old_testament .

disputed because kb_sulfate little is known about the cultures that produced them . the oldest kb_art kb_object_relations_theory in the world—a series of tiny , drilled kb_snail kb_electron_shells about 75,000 years old—were discovered in kb_a kb_southern_africa kb_african_plate cave . containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100,000 years . etched

civilizations , more of their kb_art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to kb_other_(philosophy) cultures and later times . some also have provided the kb_first_trimester kb_record_(computer_science) of how artists worked . for example , this period of kb_ancient_greek kb_art saw kb_a veneration of the kb_human kb_health kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism and the development of kb_cognate skills to show musculature , poise , kb_beauty , and anatomically correct proportions .in kb_byzantine_empire and kb_medieval_art of the kb_western_esotericism kb_middle_ages ages , much kb_art focused on the expression of kb_british_subject about kb_biblical and kb_religion kb_albanian_culture , and used kb_art_movement that showed the higher kb_glory_(religion) of kb_a heavenly kb_world , such as the use of kb_gold in the background of paintings , or kb_glass in mosaics or kb_microsoft_windows , which also presented figures in idealized , patterned ( flat ) kb_theory_of_forms . nevertheless , kb_a kb_classical_conditioning kb_mathematical_realism kb_tradition persisted in small kb_byzantine_empire works , and kb_metaphysical_realism steadily grew in the kb_art of kb_catholic_europe .kb_renaissance_art had kb_a greatly increased kb_emphasis_(typography) on the realistic

, kb_calligraphy , and kb_architecture . further kb_east_africa , kb_religion dominated artistic kb_art_movement and kb_theory_of_forms too . kb_indian_subcontinent and tibet saw kb_emphasis_(typography) on painted sculptures and kb_dance , while kb_religion kb_painting kb_loanword many conventions from kb_sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with kb_emphasis_(typography) on outlines . kb_china saw the flourishing of many kb_art kb_theory_of_forms : jade carving , bronzework , kb_ancient_egyptian_pottery ( including the stunning kb_terracotta_army of kb_byzantine_emperors qin ) , kb_poetry , kb_calligraphy , kb_music , kb_painting , drama , kb_artificial_intelligence_in_fiction , etc . kb_chinese_characters kb_art_movement vary greatly from era to era and each kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) is traditionally kb_english_alphabet#letter_names after the ruling kb_dynasty . kb_sulfate , for example , kb_tang_dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse , emphasizing idealized landscapes , but kb_ming_dynasty kb_dynasty paintings are busy and colorful , and focus on telling stories via setting and kb_function_composition . kb_japan names its kb_art_movement after kb_ottoman_empire dynasties too , and also saw much interplay between the kb_art_movement of kb_calligraphy and kb_painting . kb_woodblock_printing printingthe kb_western_esotericism kb_age_of_enlightenment of kb_age_of_enlightenment in the kb_18th_century century saw artistic depictions of kb_health and kb_rational_number certainties of the clockwork kb_universe , as kb_water_well as kb_politics_of_albania revolutionary visions of kb_a post-monarchist kb_world , such as kb_william_blake 's portrayal of

of the emotional side and individuality of humans , exemplified in the kb_novels of kb_goethe . the late kb_rilindja_kombëtare century then saw kb_a host of artistic movements , such as kb_academic_art kb_art , kb_symbolism_(arts) , kb_impressionism and kb_fauvism among others .the kb_history of twentieth-century kb_art is kb_a kb_narrative of endless possibilities and the search for kb_new_world kb_corporate_social_responsibility , each kb_being torn down in succession by the kb_next . thus the parameters of kb_impressionism , kb_expressionism , kb_fauvism , kb_cubism ,

kb_time_(magazine) saw an kb_cognate influence of kb_other_(philosophy) cultures into kb_art_of_europe . thus , kb_japanese_language woodblock prints ( themselves influenced by kb_western_esotericism kb_renaissance draftsmanship ) had an immense influence on kb_impressionism and subsequent development . later , kb_african_art were taken up by picasso and to some extent by kb_matisse . similarly , in the 19th and 20th kb_century_(cricket) the kb_western_culture has had huge impacts on kb_eastern_hemisphere kb_art with originally kb_western_esotericism kb_idea like kb_communism and kb_post-modernism exerting kb_a powerful influence .kb_modernism , the idealistic search for kb_truth , gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to kb_a realization of its unattainability . kb_theodor_w._adorno w. adorno said in 1970 , `` kb_it is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns kb_art can kb_beryllium taken for granted any more : neither kb_art itself , nor kb_art in

cultures of the kb_world and of kb_history are seen as changing kb_theory_of_forms , which can kb_beryllium appreciated and kb_drawing_(metalworking) from only with kb_skepticism and irony . furthermore , the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue kb_it is now more appropriate to think in terms of kb_a kb_globalization kb_albanian_culture , rather than of kb_regional_power ones .in `` kb_the_origin_of_the_work_of_art kb_evolution of the kb_cold_working of kb_art '' , kb_martin_heidegger heideggerthe kb_creativity kb_arts are often divided into more specific categories , typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as kb_medes , kb_genre , kb_art_movement , and kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . kb_art kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism refers to the kb_elements_of_art kb_art that are independent of its kb_interpretation_(logic) or kb_importance . kb_it kb_cover_version the methods kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by the kb_artist and the kb_health kb_function_composition of the artwork , primarily non-semantic aspects of the kb_cold_working ( i.e. , kb_figurae ) , such as kb_color , kb_contour_drawing , kb_dimension , kb_list_of_art_mediums , kb_melody , kb_space , kb_texture_(painting) , and kb_lightness . kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism may also include kb_visual_design_elements_and_principles#principles_of_design design principles , such as arrangement , kb_formal_balance , kb_contrast_(vision) , kb_emphasis_(typography) , kb_harmony , kb_hierarchical_proportion , kb_principles_of_grouping , and kb_rhythm .in kb_general_(united_states) there are kb_triliteral schools of kb_philosophy regarding kb_art , focusing respectively on kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , content , and kb_context_(language_use) . extreme kb_formalism_(art) is the view that all kb_aesthetic kb_chemical_property of kb_art are formal ( that is , part of the kb_art kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism ) . kb_philosopher almost kb_universal_reconciliation reject this view and hold that the kb_chemical_property and kb_schopenhauer's_aesthetics of kb_art extend beyond materials , techniques , and kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . unfortunately , there is little consensus on terminology for these informal kb_chemical_property . some authors refer to kb_grammatical_subject kb_matter and content – i.e. , denotations and connotations – while others prefer terms like kb_meaning_(linguistics) and kb_importance .extreme intentionalism holds that kb_authorial_intent intent kb_play_(theatre) kb_a decisive role in the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art , conveying the content or kb_essential_element main idea , while all kb_other_(philosophy) interpretations can kb_beryllium discarded . kb_it defines the kb_grammatical_subject as the persons or idea represented , and the content as the kb_artist 's experience of that kb_grammatical_subject . for example , the kb_function_composition of kb_napoleon_i_on_his_imperial_throne on kb_histidine kb_ottoman_empire throne is partly kb_loanword from the kb_statue_of_zeus_at_olympia kb_zeus at kb_olympia_(manet) . as evidenced by the kb_title , the kb_grammatical_subject is kb_napoleon , and the content is kb_jean-auguste-dominique_ingres 's kb_representation_(arts) of kb_napoleon as `` emperor-god beyond kb_time_(magazine) and kb_space '' . similarly to extreme kb_formalism_(art) , kb_philosopher typically reject extreme intentionalism , because kb_art may have kb_cross-platform_software ambiguous meanings and kb_authorial_intent intent may kb_beryllium kb_uncertainty and thus irrelevant . its restrictive kb_interpretation_(logic) is `` socially unhealthy , philosophically unreal , and kb_politics_of_albania unwise '' .finally , the developing kb_theory of kb_post-structuralism studies kb_art 's kb_importance in kb_a kb_cultural_anthropology kb_context_(language_use) , such as the kb_idea , emotions , and reactions prompted by kb_a kb_cold_working . the kb_cultural_anthropology kb_context_(language_use) often kb_redox to the kb_artist 's techniques and intentions , in which case kb_analysis proceeds along lines similar to kb_formalism_(art) and intentionalism . however , in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_noun_case historical and kb_material conditions may predominate , such as kb_religion and kb_philosophy convictions , sociopolitical and kb_economic_anthropology kb_structural_analysis , or even kb_climate_of_albania and kb_geography . kb_art_criticismkb_art can connote kb_a kb_word_sense of trained ability or mastery of kb_a kb_list_of_art_mediums . kb_art can also simply refer to the kb_adaptation and efficient use of kb_a kb_language `` kb_art '' , kb_particular in its elevated kb_word_sense , requires kb_a certain level of kb_creativity expertise by the kb_artist , whether this kb_beryllium kb_a demonstration of technical ability , an originality in stylistic approach , or kb_a combination of these kb_2_(number) . traditionally skill of execution was viewed as kb_a quality inseparable from kb_art and thus necessary for its success ; for kb_leonardo_da_vinci da vinci , kb_art , neither more nor less than kb_histidine kb_other_(philosophy) endeavors , was kb_a manifestation of skill . kb_rembrandt 's kb_cold_working , now praised for its ephemeral virtues , was most admired by kb_histidine contemporaries for its virtuosity . at the kb_turn_(geometry) of the 20th century , the adroit performances of kb_john_singer_sargent sargent were alternately admired and viewed with kb_skepticism for their kb_manual_(music) kb_fluency , yet at nearly the same kb_time_(magazine) the kb_artist kb_world_health_organization would become the era 's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast , kb_pablo_picasso picassokb_a common contemporary criticism of some kb_modern_art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic kb_space_debris . in kb_conceptual_art , kb_marcel_duchamp kb_duchamp 's `` kb_fountain_(duchamp) '' is among the kb_first_trimester examples of pieces wherein the kb_artist used kb_found_art kb_object_relations_theory ( `` ready-made '' ) and exercised no traditionally recognised kb_set_(mythology) of skills . kb_tracey_emin kb_tracey_emin 's `` my bed '' , or kb_damien_hirst kb_damien_hirstsince kb_history_of_abortion , much of the finest kb_art has represented kb_a deliberate kb_computer_monitor of wealth or kb_power_(physics) , often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials . much kb_art has been commissioned by kb_politics rulers or kb_religion establishments , with more modest versions only kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance to the most wealthy in society .nevertheless , there have been many periods where kb_art of very kb_high_middle_ages quality was kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance , in terms of kb_ownership , across kb_prespa_lake parts of society , above all in cheap kb_medes such as kb_ancient_egyptian_pottery , which persists in the ground , and perishable kb_medes such as kb_textile_industry and kb_wood . in many different cultures , the kb_ceramics_of_indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas of kb_indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas of the kb_americas are found in such kb_a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to kb_a kb_social_elite , though kb_other_(philosophy) kb_theory_of_forms of kb_art may have been . reproductive methods such as kb_molding_(process) made mass-production easier , and were used to bring high-quality kb_ancient_roman_pottery kb_ancient_egyptian_pottery and kb_ancient_greek tanagra figurines to kb_a very wide market . kb_cylinder_seals were both artistic and practical , and very widely used by what can kb_beryllium loosely called the middle kb_class_(biology) in the kb_ancient_near_east kb_east_africa . once kb_ancient_roman_coinage were widely used , these also became an kb_art kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism that reached the widest range of society .another important kb_list_of_azerbaijani_inventions_and_discoveries came in the 15th century in kb_europe , when kb_printmaking began with small woodcuts , mostly kb_religion , that were often very small and hand-colored , and affordable even by peasants kb_world_health_organization glued them to the walls of their homes . printed books were initially very expensive , but fell steadily in kb_price until by the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations . kb_popular_prints prints of many different sorts have decorated homes and kb_other_(philosophy) places for kb_century_(cricket) .kb_public_art and monuments , kb_secular and kb_religion , by their kb_nature normally address the whole of

in their design . kb_egyptian_temples are typical in that the most kb_largest_organisms and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could kb_beryllium seen by the kb_general_(united_states) kb_state_school , rather than the areas seen only by the kb_priests . many areas of royal palaces , castles and the houses of the kb_social_elite were often generally accessible , and kb_prespa_lake parts of the kb_art collections of such kb_people_(american_magazine) could often kb_beryllium seen , either by anybody , or by those able to pay kb_a small kb_price , or those wearing the correct clothes , regardless of kb_world_health_organization they were , as at the kb_palace_of_versailles of versailles , where the appropriate kb_extra_(australian_tv_channel) accessories ( kb_silver shoe buckles and kb_a kb_sword ) could kb_beryllium hired from shops outside .special arrangements were made to allow the kb_state_school to kb_episcopal_see many royal or kb_private_aviation collections placed in kb_art_gallery , as with the kb_orleans_collection#collection_in_paris kb_class_(set_theory) mostly housed in kb_a kb_wing of the kb_palais_royal royal in kb_paris , which could kb_beryllium visited for most of the kb_18th_century century . in kb_italy the kb_art kb_tourism_in_angola of the kb_grand_tour tour became kb_a kb_major_(united_states) kb_industry from the kb_renaissance onwards , and governments and cities made efforts to make their kb_key_(cryptography) works accessible . the kb_kingdom_of_great_britain kb_royal_collection kb_class_(set_theory) remains distinct , but kb_prespa_lake donations such as the kb_old_royal_library library were made from kb_it to kb_british_museum kb_british_museum , established in 1753. the kb_uffizi in kb_florence opened entirely as kb_a gallery in 1765 , though this kb_function_(biology) had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants ' offices for kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_time_(magazine) before . the building now kb_dutch_loango-angola by the kb_prado in kb_madrid was built before the kb_french_revolution for the kb_state_school kb_computer_monitor of parts of the royal kb_art kb_class_(set_theory) , and similar royal kb_art_gallery kb_open_standard to the kb_state_school existed in kb_vienna , kb_munich and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_capital_(architecture) . the opening of the kb_musée_du_louvre du louvre during the kb_french_revolution ( in 1793 ) as kb_a kb_state_school kb_museum for much of the former kb_france kb_royal_collection kb_class_(set_theory) certainly marked an important stage in the development of kb_state_school access to kb_art , transferring kb_ownership to kb_a kb_roman_republic kb_state_of_matter , but was kb_a continuation of trends already kb_water_well established .most kb_modern_history kb_state_school museums and kb_visual_arts_education programs for children in schools can kb_beryllium traced back to this impulse to have kb_art kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance to everyone . museums in the united kb_sovereign_state tend to kb_beryllium gifts from the very rich to the

to and fro over the kb_century_(cricket) . this concern is largely absent in kb_other_(philosophy) traditions of kb_art . the kb_aesthetic theorist kb_john_ruskin , kb_world_health_organization championed what kb_he_(letter) saw as the kb_realism_(arts) of j. m. w. kb_j._m._w._turner , saw kb_art 's role as the kb_communication by artifice of an kb_essential_element kb_truth that could only kb_beryllium found in kb_nature .the kb_definition and evaluation of kb_art has become especially problematic since the 20th century . kb_richard_wollheim wollheim distinguishes kb_triliteral approaches to assessing the kb_aesthetic kb_lightness of kb_art : the kb_mathematical_realism , whereby kb_aesthetic quality is an kb_absolute_value independent of any kb_human view ; the kb_objectivity_(philosophy) , whereby kb_it is also an kb_absolute_value , but is dependent on kb_general_(united_states) kb_human experience ; and the kb_relativist kb_positional_notationthe kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_modernism in the late nineteenth century kb_lead to kb_a kb_political_radicalism break in the kb_human_fertilization of the kb_function_(biology) of kb_art , and then

kb_modern_art as `` the use of kb_characteristic_(algebra) methods of kb_a discipline to criticize the discipline itself '' . greenberg originally kb_applied_science this idea to the abstract

kb_andy_warhol warhol became both noteworthy and influential through kb_cold_working including and possibly critiquing popular kb_albanian_culture , as kb_water_well as the kb_art_world . artists of the 1980s , 1990s , and kb_2000s_in_angola expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond `` kb_high_middle_ages kb_art '' to all kb_cultural_anthropology image-making , including fashion images , comics , billboards and pornography .kb_duchamp once kb_anatolian_hypothesis that kb_art is any activity of any kind- everything . however , the way that only certain activities are classified today as kb_art is kb_a kb_social_anarchism kb_construction . there is kb_evidence_(law) that there may kb_beryllium an kb_chemical_element of kb_truth to this . `` the invention of kb_art : kb_a kb_cultural_anthropology kb_history '' is an kb_art_history book which examines the kb_construction of the kb_modern_history system of kb_the_arts kb_arts i.e . kb_fine_art . shiner finds kb_evidence_(law) that the older system of kb_the_arts kb_arts before our kb_modern_history system ( kb_fine_art ) held kb_art to kb_beryllium any skilled kb_human activity i.e . kb_ancient_greek society did not possess the kb_terminology kb_art but kb_techne . kb_techne can kb_beryllium understood neither as kb_art or kb_craft , the kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving kb_being that the kb_aspect_ratio_(image)#distinctions of kb_art and kb_craft are historical products that came later on in kb_human kb_history . kb_techne included kb_painting , sculpting and kb_music but also ; cooking , kb_medicine , kb_horsemanship , kb_geometry , kb_carpentry , kb_prophecy , and farming etc .following kb_duchamp during the kb_first_trimester half of the twentieth century , kb_a significant kb_shift_code to kb_general_(united_states) kb_aesthetic kb_theory took kb_place_of_articulation which attempted to apply kb_aesthetic kb_theory between various kb_theory_of_forms of kb_art , including the literary kb_arts and the kb_visual_arts kb_arts , to each kb_other_(philosophy) . this resulted in the rise of kb_the_new_criticism kb_new_criticism kb_school and kb_abortion_debate concerning `` kb_intentional_fallacy intentional fallacy '' . at issue was the kb_question of whether the kb_aesthetic intentions of the kb_artist in creating the kb_cold_working of kb_art , whatever its specific kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , should kb_beryllium associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final kb_decay_product of the kb_cold_working of kb_art , or , if the kb_cold_working of kb_art should kb_beryllium evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the kb_artist .in 1946 , kb_w._k._wimsatt k. wimsatt and kb_monroe_beardsley beardsley published kb_a classic and controversial kb_new_world critical essay entitled `` kb_intentional_fallacy intentional fallacy '' , in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author 's intention , or `` kb_intention kb_meaning_(linguistics) '' in the kb_analysis of kb_a literary kb_cold_working . for wimsatt and beardsley , the kb_lexical_semantics on the page were all that mattered ; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant , and potentially distracting .in another essay , `` kb_affective_fallacy affective fallacy , '' which served as kb_a kind of sister essay to `` kb_intentional_fallacy intentional fallacy '' wimsatt and beardsley also discounted the kb_reader_(academic_rank) 's personal/emotional reaction to kb_a literary kb_cold_working as kb_a valid means of analyzing kb_a text . this fallacy would later kb_beryllium repudiated by theorists from the kb_reader-response kb_school of literary kb_theory . ironically , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the leading theorists from this kb_school , kb_stanley_fish kb_fish , was himself trained by kb_new_world kb_art_critic . kb_fish criticizes wimsatt and beardsley in kb_histidine essay `` kb_ancient_egyptian_literature in the kb_reader_(academic_rank) '' ( 1970 ) .as summarized by gaut and livingston in their essay `` the creation of kb_art '' : `` kb_structuralism and post-structuralists theorists and kb_art_critic were sharply critical of many aspects of kb_new_criticism , beginning with the kb_emphasis_(typography) on kb_aesthetic appreciation and the so-called kb_self-governance of kb_art , but they reiterated the attack on kb_biographical_film criticisms 's assumption that the kb_artist 's activities and experience were kb_a privileged critical kb_topic_(linguistics) . '' these authors contend that : `` anti-intentionalists , such as formalists , hold that the intentions involved in the making of kb_art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting kb_art . kb_sulfate details of the act of creating kb_a kb_cold_working , though possibly of kb_interest in themselves , have no bearing on the correct kb_interpretation_(logic) of the kb_cold_working . ''gaut and livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that : `` intentionalists , unlike formalists , hold that reference to intentions is kb_essential_element in fixing the correct kb_interpretation_(logic) of works . '' they quote kb_richard_wollheim wollheim as stating that , `` the task of criticism is the kb_reconstruction_era of the kb_creativity process , where the kb_creativity process must in kb_turn_(geometry) kb_beryllium thought of as something not stopping short of , but terminating on , the kb_cold_working of kb_art itself . ''the end of the 20th century fostered an extensive kb_abortion_debate known as the kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_turn_(geometry) kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war , or the `` innocent kb_human_eye kb_abortion_debate '' , and generally referred to as the structuralism-poststructuralism kb_abortion_debate in the kb_philosophy of kb_art . this kb_abortion_debate discussed the encounter of the kb_cold_working of kb_art as kb_being determined by the relative extent to which the kb_concept encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art .decisive for the kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_turn_(geometry) kb_abortion_debate in kb_art_history and the kb_humanities were the works of yet another kb_tradition , namely the kb_structuralism of kb_ferdinand_de_saussure kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann saussure and the ensuing kb_movement_(sign_language) of kb_poststructuralism . in 1981 , the kb_artist kb_mark_tansey created kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art titled `` the innocent kb_human_eye '' as kb_a criticism of the prevailing kb_climate_of_albania of disagreement in the kb_philosophy of kb_art during the closing decades of the 20th century . influential theorists include kb_judith_butler butler , kb_luce_irigaray irigaray , kb_julia_kristeva , kb_michel_foucault kb_léon_foucault and kb_jacques_derrida derrida . the kb_power_(physics) of kb_language , more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes , in kb_art_history and historical kb_discourse was explored by kb_hayden_white kb_white_american . the kb_fact that kb_language is `` not '' kb_a transparent kb_list_of_art_mediums of thought had been stressed by kb_a very different kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_philosophy_of_language kb_language which originated in the works of kb_johann_georg_hamann georg hamann and kb_wilhelm_von_humboldt von humboldt . kb_ernst_gombrich gombrich and kb_nelson_goodman goodman in kb_histidine book `` languages of kb_art : an approach to kb_a kb_theory of kb_symbols '' came to hold that the kb_concept encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the kb_cold_working of kb_art during the kb_1960s_in_the_united_states and 1970s . kb_he_(letter) was challenged on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of kb_research done by the kb_nobel_prize prize winning psychologist kb_roger_sperry sperry kb_world_health_organization maintained that the kb_human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in kb_language alone ( the kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_turn_(geometry) ) and that kb_other_(philosophy) kb_theory_of_forms of kb_psychology representations of the kb_cold_working of kb_art were equally defensible and demonstrable . sperry 's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with kb_aesthetic kb_philosopher such as kb_nick_zangwill zangwill disputes as to whether or not to classify something as kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art are referred to as classificatory disputes about kb_art . classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included kb_cubism and kb_impressionist paintings , kb_duchamp 's `` kb_fountain_(duchamp) '' , the movies , superlative imitations of kb_j._s._g._boggs , kb_conceptual_art , and kb_video_games . kb_philosophy kb_jacques-louis_david novitz has argued that disagreement about the kb_definition of kb_art are rarely the kb_heart of the problem . rather , `` the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their kb_social_anarchism kb_life_(magazine) '' are `` kb_sulfate much kb_a part of all classificatory disputes about kb_art '' ( novitz , 1996 ) . according to novitz , classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to kb_go_(game) than they are about kb_theory proper . for example , when the `` kb_daily_mail kb_airmail '' criticized kb_damien_hirst 's and kb_tracey_emin 's kb_cold_working by arguing `` for 1,000 years kb_art has been kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of our great civilising kb_afsharid_dynasty . today , pickled kb_sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) all '' they are not advancing kb_a kb_definition or kb_theory about kb_art , but questioning the kb_lightness of kb_damien_hirst 's and kb_tracey_emin 's kb_cold_working . in kb_1998_nrl_season , kb_arthur_danto , suggested kb_a kb_einstein's_thought_experiments kb_experiment showing that `` the status of an artifact as kb_cold_working of kb_art results from the kb_idea kb_a kb_albanian_culture applies to kb_it , rather than its inherent kb_health or perceptible qualities . kb_cultural_anthropology kb_interpretation_(logic) ( an kb_art kb_theory of some kind ) is therefore constitutive of an kb_space_debris 's arthood . ''kb_anti-art is kb_a label for kb_art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of kb_art ; kb_it is kb_terminology associated with kb_dadaism and attributed to kb_marcel_duchamp kb_duchamp just before kb_world_war_i kb_iodine , when kb_he_(letter) was making kb_art from kb_found_art kb_object_relations_theory . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of these , `` kb_fountain_(duchamp) '' ( 1917 ) , an kb_ordinary_(officer) urinal , has achieved considerable kb_topographic_prominence and influence on kb_art . kb_anti-art is kb_a kb_i_shot_andy_warhol of kb_cold_working by kb_situationist_international international , the lo-fi kb_airmail kb_art_movement , and the kb_young_british_artists artists , though kb_it is kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism still rejected by the kb_stuckism , kb_world_health_organization describe themselves as kb_anti-anti-art .kb_architecture is often included as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_visual_arts kb_arts ; however , like the kb_decorative_artssomewhat in relation to the above , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_art '' is also used to apply judgments of kb_lightness , as in such expressions as `` that meal was kb_a kb_cold_working of kb_art '' ( the cook is an kb_artist ) , or `` the kb_art of deception '' , ( the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised ) . kb_it is this use of kb_the_word_(free_love) word as kb_a kb_measure_(mathematics) of kb_high_middle_ages quality and kb_high_middle_ages kb_lightness that gives the kb_terminology its kb_flavor of subjectivity . making judgments of kb_lightness requires kb_a kb_basis_(linear_algebra) for criticism . at the simplest level , kb_a way to determine whether the impact of the kb_space_debris on the senses meets the criteria to kb_beryllium considered `` kb_art '' is whether kb_it is perceived to kb_beryllium attractive or repulsive . though kb_machine_perception is always colored by experience , and is necessarily subjective , kb_it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying can not kb_beryllium kb_art . however , `` good '' kb_art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to kb_a majority of viewers . in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_lexical_semantics , an kb_artist 's kb_prime_(symbol) kb_motivation need not kb_beryllium the pursuit of the kb_aesthetic . also , kb_art often depicts terrible images made for kb_social_anarchism , kb_morality , or thought-provoking reasons . for example , kb_francisco_goya goya 's kb_painting depicting the kb_spanish_empire shootings of 3rd of may 1808 is kb_a graphic depiction of kb_a firing squad executing several kb_pleading kb_civilian_casualties . yet at the same kb_time_(magazine) , the horrific kb_imagery demonstrates goya 's keen artistic ability in kb_function_composition and execution and produces fitting kb_social_anarchism and kb_politics outrage . thus , the kb_abortion_debate continues as to what kb_musical_mode of kb_aesthetic satisfaction , if any , is required to define 'art ' .the assumption of kb_new_world values or the rebellion against kb_acceptance#self_acceptance notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with kb_a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing . indeed , the kb_obverse_and_reverse is often kb_truth , that the revision of what is kb_folk_etymology conceived of as kb_being aesthetically appealing allows for kb_a re-invigoration of kb_aesthetic sensibility , and kb_a kb_new_world appreciation for the kb_corporate_social_responsibility of kb_art itself . countless schools have kb_anatolian_hypothesis their own ways to define quality , yet they all seem to agree in at least kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) point : once their kb_aesthetic choices are kb_acceptance#self_acceptance , the kb_lightness of the kb_cold_working of kb_art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen kb_list_of_art_mediums to kb_strike_action some kb_universal_studios chord by the rarity of the skill of the kb_artist or in its accurate kb_reflection_(physics) in what is termed the `` kb_zeitgeist '' . kb_art is often kb_intention to kb_appeal to and connect with kb_human kb_emotion . kb_it can arouse kb_aesthetic or kb_morality feelings , and can kb_beryllium understood as kb_a way of communicating these feelings . artists express something kb_sulfate that their audience is aroused to some extent

result from kb_unintended_pregnancy pregnancies . in the kb_united_kingdom kb_kingdom_(biology) , 1 to kb_alkaline_earth_metal % of abortions are done due to kb_heredity kb_problems_(aristotle) in the kb_fetus . kb_a kb_pregnancy can kb_beryllium intentionally aborted in several ways . the manner selected often depends upon the kb_gestational_age age of the kb_embryo or kb_fetus , which increases in size as the kb_pregnancy progresses . specific procedures may also kb_beryllium selected due to legality , kb_regional_power availability , and kb_physician or kb_a woman 's kb_personal_property preference .reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective . an kb_abortion is medically referred to as kb_a therapeutic kb_abortion when kb_it is performed to save the kb_life_(magazine) of the kb_pregnant woman ; to prevent harm to the woman 's kb_health or kb_mental_health ; to terminate kb_a kb_pregnancy where indications are that the child kb_will_and_testament have kb_a significantly increased chance of mortality or morbidity ; or to kb_selective_reduction reduce the kb_grammatical_number of kb_fetuses to lessen health risks associated with kb_multiple_pregnancy . an kb_abortion is referred to as an elective or kb_pledge_of_allegiance_(united_states)#legal_challenges kb_abortion when kb_it is performed at the request of the woman for non-medical reasons . kb_confusion sometimes arises over the kb_terminology `` elective '' because `` kb_elective_surgery kb_surgery '' generally refers to all scheduled kb_surgery , whether medically necessary or not .kb_miscarriage , also known as spontaneous kb_abortion , is the unintentional kb_expulsion_of_cham_albanians of an kb_embryo or kb_fetus before the 24th kb_gestational_age of kb_gestation . kb_a kb_pregnancy that ends before 37 weeks of kb_gestation resulting in kb_a kb_live_birth_(human) infant is kb_a `` kb_premature_birth birth '' or kb_a `` preterm birth '' . when kb_a kb_fetus dies kb_in_utero utero after kb_fetal_viability , or during kb_childbirth , kb_it is usually termed `` kb_stillbirth '' . kb_premature_births births and stillbirths are generally not considered to kb_beryllium miscarriages although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap .only 30 % to 50 % of conceptions progress kb_past the kb_first_trimester . the vast majority of those that do not progress are kb_lost_film before the woman is kb_clinically_silent of the kb_human_fertilization , and many pregnancies are kb_lost_film before kb_medical_abortion practitioners can detect an kb_embryo . between 15 % and 30 % of known pregnancies end in clinically apparent kb_miscarriage , depending upon the age and health of the kb_pregnant woman . 80 % of these spontaneous abortions happen in the kb_first_trimester .the most common cause of spontaneous kb_abortion during the kb_first_trimester is kb_chromosomal_abnormalities abnormalities of the kb_embryo or kb_fetus , accounting for at least 50 % of sampled early kb_pregnancy losses . kb_other_(philosophy) kb_causes_of_autism include kb_vascular_disease kb_disease ( such as kb_lupus_of_troyes ) , kb_diabetes , kb_other_(philosophy) kb_endocrine_disease , kb_infection , and abnormalities of the kb_uterus . advancing maternal age and kb_a woman 's kb_history of previous spontaneous abortions are the kb_2_(number) leading factors associated with kb_a greater kb_risk of spontaneous kb_abortion . kb_a spontaneous kb_abortion can also kb_beryllium caused by accidental kb_physical_trauma ; intentional kb_physical_trauma or kb_stress_(linguistics) to cause kb_miscarriage is considered kb_#induced kb_abortion or kb_feticide .kb_medical_abortion abortions are those induced by kb_abortifacient pharmaceuticals . kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion became an alternative method of kb_abortion with the availability of kb_prostaglandin kb_prostaglandin_analogue in the 1970s and the kb_antiprogestin kb_mifepristone ( also known as ru-486 ) in the 1980s .the most common early first-trimester kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion regimens use kb_mifepristone in combination with kb_a kb_prostaglandin kb_analog_device ( kb_misoprostol or kb_gemeprost ) up to 9 weeks kb_gestational_age age , kb_methotrexate in combination with kb_a kb_prostaglandin kb_analog_device up to 7 weeks kb_gestation , or kb_a kb_prostaglandin kb_analog_device alone . mifepristone–misoprostol combination regimens kb_cold_working faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexate–misoprostol combination regimens , and combination regimens are more effective than kb_misoprostol alone . this regime is effective in the kb_second_trimester . kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion regiments involving kb_mifepristone followed by kb_misoprostol in the cheek between 24 and 48 hours later are effective when performed before 63 days ' kb_gestation .in very early abortions , up to 7 weeks kb_gestation , kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion using kb_a mifepristone–misoprostol combination regimen is considered to kb_beryllium more effective than surgical kb_abortion ( kb_vacuum_aspiration ) , especially when kb_clinical_linguistics practice does not include detailed kb_inspection of aspirated kb_tissue_(biology) . early kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion regimens using kb_mifepristone , followed 24–48 hours later by buccal or vaginal kb_misoprostol are 98 % effective up to 9 weeks kb_gestational_age age . if kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion fails , surgical kb_abortion must kb_beryllium used to complete the procedure .early kb_medical_abortion abortions account for the majority of abortions before 9 weeks kb_gestation in kb_great_britain , kb_france , kb_switzerland , and the kb_nordic_countries . in the united kb_sovereign_state , the percentage of early kb_medical_abortion abortions is around 30 % .kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion regimens using kb_mifepristone in combination with kb_a kb_prostaglandin kb_analog_device are the most common methods used for second-trimester abortions in kb_canada , most of kb_europe , kb_china and kb_indian_subcontinent , in kb_contrast_(vision) to the united kb_sovereign_state where 96 % of second-trimester abortions are performed surgically by kb_dilation_and_evacuation and evacuationup to 15 weeks ' kb_gestation , kb_suction-aspiration_abortion or kb_vacuum_aspiration are the most common surgical methods of kb_#induced kb_abortion . `` kb_manual_(music) kb_vacuum_aspiration '' ( mva ) consists of removing the kb_fetus or kb_embryo , kb_placenta , and membranes by suction using kb_a kb_manual_(music) syringe , while `` electric kb_vacuum_aspiration '' ( eva ) uses an electric pump . these techniques differ in the kb_mechanism_(biology) used to apply suction , in how early in kb_pregnancy they can kb_beryllium used , and in whether kb_cervical_dilation is necessary .mva , also known as `` mini-suction '' and `` kb_menstrual_extraction extraction '' , can kb_beryllium used in very early kb_pregnancy , and does not require kb_cervical_dilation . kb_dilation_and_curettage and kb_curettage ( d & kb_vitamin_c ) , the kb_second most common method of surgical kb_abortion , is kb_a standard gynecological procedure performed for kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of reasons , including kb_hypothesis of the uterine lining for possible malignancy , investigation of abnormal bleeding , and kb_abortion . kb_curettage refers to cleaning the walls of the kb_uterus with kb_a kb_curette . the kb_world_health_organization organization recommends this procedure , also called `` sharp kb_curettage , '' only when mva is unavailable .from the 15th kb_gestational_age of kb_gestation until approximately the 26th , kb_other_(philosophy) techniques must kb_beryllium used . kb_dilation_and_evacuation and evacuation ( d & e ) consists of opening the kb_cervix of the kb_uterus and emptying kb_it using surgical instruments and suction . after the 16th kb_gestational_age of kb_gestation , abortions can also kb_beryllium induced by kb_intact_dilation_and_extraction dilation and extraction ( idx ) ( also called intrauterine cranial decompression ) , which requires surgical decompression of the kb_fetus 's kb_human_head before evacuation . idx is sometimes called `` kb_partial-birth_abortion kb_abortion '' , which has been kb_partial-birth_abortion_ban_act banned in the united kb_sovereign_state .in the kb_ipad_(third_generation) kb_pregnancy#terminology of kb_pregnancy , kb_#induced kb_abortion may kb_beryllium performed surgically by kb_intact_dilation_and_extraction dilation and extraction or by kb_hysterotomy_abortion . kb_hysterotomy_abortion is kb_a procedure similar to kb_a kb_caesarean_section kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) and is performed under kb_general_anesthesia . kb_it requires kb_a smaller incision than kb_a kb_caesarean_section kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) and is used during later stages of kb_pregnancy .first-trimester procedures can generally kb_beryllium performed using kb_local_anesthesia anesthesia , while second-trimester methods may require kb_sedation#levels_of_sedation sedation or kb_general_anesthesia .in places lacking the necessary kb_medical_abortion skill for dilation and extraction , or where preferred by practitioners , an kb_abortion can kb_beryllium induced by kb_first_trimester kb_labor_induction kb_australian_labor_party and then kb_late_termination_of_pregnancy#methods fetal demise if necessary . this is sometimes called `` induced kb_miscarriage '' . this procedure may kb_beryllium performed from kb_boron_group weeks kb_gestation to the kb_ipad_(third_generation) kb_pregnancy#terminology . although kb_it is very uncommon in the united kb_sovereign_state , more than 80 % of induced abortions throughout the kb_second_trimester are labor-induced abortions in kb_sweden and kb_other_(philosophy) nearby countries .only limited kb_big_data are kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance comparing this method with dilation and extraction . unlike d & e , labor-induced abortions after kb_18-point_agreement weeks may kb_beryllium complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival , which may kb_beryllium legally characterized as kb_viviparity birth . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , labor-induced kb_abortion is legally risky in the united kb_sovereign_state .kb_history , kb_a kb_grammatical_number of kb_herbaceous_plant reputed to possess kb_abortifacient kb_chemical_property have been used in kb_folk_medicine . among these are : kb_tansy , kb_mentha_pulegium , kb_black_cohosh , and the now-extinct kb_silphium .in 1978 kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) woman in kb_colorado died and another was seriously injured when they attempted to procure an kb_abortion by taking kb_mentha_pulegium kb_palm_oil .because the indiscriminant use of kb_herbaceous_plant as abortifacients can cause serious—even lethal—side effects , such as kb_multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome failure , such use is not recommended by physicians .kb_abortion is sometimes attempted by causing kb_physical_trauma to the kb_abdomen . the kb_degree_(angle) of kb_force , if severe , can cause serious internal kb_injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing kb_miscarriage . in kb_southeast_asia , there is an kb_ancient_history kb_tradition of

kb_a kb_demon performing such an kb_abortion upon kb_a woman kb_world_health_organization has been sent to the kb_underworld .reported methods of unsafe , kb_self-induced_abortion kb_abortion include misuse of kb_misoprostolthe health risks of kb_abortion depend principally upon whether the procedure is performed safely or unsafely . the kb_world_health_organization organization defines unsafe abortions as those performed by unskilled individuals , with kb_hazardous equipment , or in unsanitary facilities . kb_law abortions performed in the kb_developed_world are among the safest procedures in kb_medicine . in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , the kb_risk of kb_maternal_death kb_death from kb_abortion is 0.7 per 100,000 procedures , making kb_abortion about kb_boron_group times safer for women than childbirth ( 8.8 kb_maternal_deaths kb_maternal_death per 100,000 live births ) . in the united kb_sovereign_state from 2000 to kb_2009_in_science , kb_abortion had kb_a lower mortality rate than kb_plastic_surgery . the kb_risk of abortion-related mortality increases with kb_gestational_age age , but remains lower than that of childbirth through at least 21 weeks ' kb_gestation . outpatient kb_abortion is as safe and effective from 64 to 70 days ' kb_gestation as kb_it is from 57 to 63 days . kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion is safe and effective for pregnancies kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet than 6 weeks ' kb_gestation .kb_vacuum_aspiration in the kb_first_trimester is the safest method of surgical kb_abortion , and can kb_beryllium performed in kb_a kb_primary_care kb_office , kb_abortion_clinic , or hospital . complications , which are rare , can include kb_uterine_perforation perforation , kb_endometritis kb_infection , and retained products of kb_human_fertilization requiring kb_a kb_second procedure to evacuate . infections account for one-third of abortion-related kb_maternal_death in the united kb_sovereign_state . the rate of complications of kb_vacuum_aspiration kb_abortion in the kb_first_trimester is similar regardless of whether the procedure is performed in kb_a hospital , surgical center , or kb_office . preventive kb_antibiotics ( such as kb_doxycycline or kb_metronidazole ) are typically given before elective kb_abortion , as they are believed to substantially reduce the kb_risk of postoperative uterine kb_infection . the rate of failed procedures does not appear to vary significantly depending on whether the kb_abortion is performed by kb_a kb_physician or kb_a kb_mid-level_practitioner practitioner . complications after second-trimester kb_abortion are similar to those after first-trimester kb_abortion , and depend somewhat on the method chosen . second-trimester abortions are generally well-tolerated .there is little difference in terms of kb_air_safety and kb_efficacy between kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion using kb_a combined regimen of kb_mifepristone and kb_misoprostol and surgical kb_abortion ( kb_vacuum_aspiration ) in early kb_first_trimester abortions up to 9 weeks kb_gestation . kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion using the kb_prostaglandin kb_analog_device kb_misoprostol alone is less effective and more painful than kb_medical_abortion kb_abortion using kb_a combined regimen of kb_mifepristone and kb_misoprostol or surgical kb_abortion .some purported risks of kb_abortion are promoted primarily by anti-abortion kb_group_(mathematics) ,but lack kb_scientific_method support . for example , the kb_question of kb_a link between kb_abortion-breast_cancer_hypothesis and kb_breast_cancer has been investigated extensively . kb_major_(united_states) kb_medical_abortion and kb_scientific_method bodies ( including the kb_world_health_organization organization , kb_national_cancer_institute kb_cancer institute , kb_american_cancer_society society , kb_royal_college_of_obstetricians_and_gynaecologists kb_college of obgyn and kb_american_congress_of_obstetricians_and_gynecologists of obgyn ) have concluded that kb_abortion does not cause kb_breast_cancer .in the kb_past even illegality has not automatically meant that the abortions were unsafe . referring to the kb_usa_davis_cup_team , historian kb_linda_gordon kb_gordon,_scotland kb_sovereign_state : `` in kb_fact , illegal abortions in this kb_country_music have an impressive kb_air_safety record . '' according to kb_rickie_solinger solinger ,authors kb_jerome kb_billy_bates and edward zawadzki describe the case of an illegal abortionist in the kb_eastern_hemisphere kb_usa_davis_cup_team in the early 20th century kb_world_health_organization was proud of having successfully completed 13,844 abortions without any fatality .in 1870s kb_new_york_city the famous abortionist/midwife kb_madame_restell restell ( anna trow lohman ) appears to have kb_lost_film very few women among her more than 100,000 patients—a lower mortality rate than the childbirth mortality rate at the kb_time_(magazine) . in 1936 the prominent professor of obstetrics and gynecology kb_frederick_j._taussig j. taussig wrote that kb_a cause of increasing mortality during the years of illegality in the kb_usa_davis_cup_team was thatkb_electric_current kb_evidence_(law) finds no relationship between most induced abortions and kb_abortion_and_mental_health kb_problems_(aristotle) kb_other_(philosophy) than those expected for any unwanted kb_pregnancy . kb_a report by the kb_american_psychological_association kb_continental_association concluded that kb_a woman 's kb_first_trimester kb_abortion is not kb_a kb_threat to kb_mental_health when carried out in the kb_first_trimester , with such women no more likely to have kb_abortion_and_mental_health kb_problems_(aristotle) than those carrying an unwanted kb_pregnancy to kb_terminology ; the mental-health outcome of kb_a woman 's kb_second or greater kb_abortion is less certain . some older reviews concluded that kb_abortion was associated with an increased kb_risk of kb_psychology kb_problems_(aristotle) ; however , they did not use an appropriate control kb_group_(periodic_table) .although some studies show kb_negative_number mental-health outcomes in women kb_world_health_organization choose abortions after the kb_first_trimester because of fetal abnormalities , more rigorous kb_research would kb_beryllium needed to show this conclusively . some kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_negative_number kb_psychology effects of kb_abortion have been referred to by anti-abortion advocates as kb_a separate condition called `` kb_post-abortion_syndrome syndromewomen seeking an kb_abortion may use unsafe methods , especially when kb_abortion is legally restricted . they may attempt kb_self-induced_abortion kb_abortion or seek the help of kb_a kb_grammatical_person without proper kb_medical_abortion kb_military_education_and_training or facilities . this can kb_lead to severe complications , such as incomplete kb_abortion , kb_sepsis , hemorrhage , and damage to kb_organ_(anatomy) kb_organ_(anatomy) .unsafe abortions are kb_a kb_major_(united_states) cause of kb_injury and kb_death among women worldwide . although kb_big_data are imprecise , kb_it is estimated that approximately 20 million unsafe abortions are performed annually , with 97 % taking kb_place_of_articulation in developing countries . unsafe abortions are believed to result in millions of kb_injuries . estimates of kb_maternal_death vary according to kb_methodology , and have ranged from 37,000 to 70,000 in the kb_past decade ; kb_maternal_death from kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion account for around kb_boron_group % of all kb_maternal_deaths kb_maternal_death . the kb_world_health_organization organization believes that mortality has fallen since the 1990s . to reduce the kb_grammatical_number of unsafe abortions , kb_state_school health organizations have generally advocated emphasizing the kb_edict_of_toleration_by_galerius of kb_abortion , kb_military_education_and_training of kb_medical_abortion personnel , and ensuring access to reproductive-health kb_service_(economics) . in response , opponents of kb_abortion point out that kb_abortion bans in no way kb_affect_(psychology) prenatal care for women kb_world_health_organization choose to carry their kb_fetus to kb_terminology . the kb_dublin kb_united_states_declaration_of_independence on maternal health , signed in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2012 , notes , `` the kb_prohibition of kb_abortion does not kb_affect_(psychology) , in any way , the availability of optimal care to kb_pregnant women . ''kb_a kb_major_(united_states) kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors in whether abortions are performed safely or not is the kb_law standing of kb_abortion . countries with restrictive kb_abortion laws have higher kb_rates_(tax) of kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion and similar overall kb_abortion kb_rates_(tax) compared to those where kb_abortion is kb_law and kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance . for example , the 1996 kb_edict_of_toleration_by_galerius of kb_abortion in kb_south_africa had an immediate kb_positive_number impact on the kb_frequency of abortion-related complications , with abortion-related kb_maternal_death dropping by more than 90 % . similar reductions in kb_maternal_mortality mortality have been observed after kb_other_(philosophy) countries have liberalized their kb_abortion laws , such as kb_romania and kb_nepal . kb_a 2011 kb_science concluded that in the united kb_sovereign_state , some state-level anti-abortion laws are correlated with lower kb_rates_(tax) of kb_abortion in that kb_state_of_matter . the kb_analysis , however , did not kb_take into account kb_air_travel to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_sovereign_state without such laws to obtain an kb_abortion . in kb_addition , kb_a lack of access to effective kb_birth_control contributes to kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion . kb_it has been estimated that the incidence of kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion could kb_beryllium kb_redox by up to 75 % ( from 20 million to 5 million annually ) if kb_modern_history kb_family_planning and maternal health kb_service_(economics) were readily kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance globally . kb_rates_(tax) of such abortions may kb_beryllium difficult to kb_measure_(mathematics) because they can kb_beryllium reported variously as kb_miscarriage , `` induced kb_miscarriage '' , `` menstrual regulation '' , `` mini-abortion '' , and `` regulation of kb_a delayed/suspended menstruation '' .forty percent of the kb_world 's women are able to access therapeutic and elective abortions within gestational limits , while an additional kb_35_arietis percent have access to kb_law kb_abortion if they meet certain kb_health , kb_mental_health , or socioeconomic criteria . while kb_maternal_mortality mortality seldom results from safe abortions , unsafe abortions result in 70,000 kb_maternal_death and 5 million disabilities per year . complications of kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion account for approximately an eighth of kb_maternal_death mortalities worldwide , though this varies by kb_region . kb_secondary_school infertility caused by an kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion kb_affect_(psychology) an estimated 24 million women . the rate of unsafe abortions has increased from 44 % to 49 % between kb_1995_davis_cup and 2008. health kb_education_in_albania , access to kb_family_planning , and improvements in health care during and after kb_abortion have been kb_anatolian_hypothesis to address this phenomenon .although kb_it is very uncommon , women undergoing surgical kb_abortion after kb_18-point_agreement weeks kb_gestation sometimes give birth to kb_a kb_fetus that may survive briefly . kb_fetal_viability kb_terminology survival is possible after 22 weeks .if kb_medical_abortion kb_stick_fighting observe signs of kb_life_(magazine) , they may kb_beryllium required to provide care : emergency kb_medical_care if the child has kb_a good chance of survival and palliative care if not . kb_feticide#use_during_legal_abortion fetal demise ; kb_big_data are kb_interpretatio_graeca as either kb_fetus or newborn . between kb_1999_australian_open and kb_2013_mediterranean_games , in the kb_usa_davis_cup_team , the kb_centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention recorded 531 such kb_maternal_death for newborns , approximately 4 per 100,000 abortions .there are kb_2_(number) commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of kb_abortion :in many places , where kb_abortion is illegal or carries kb_a heavy kb_social_stigma , kb_medical_abortion reporting of kb_abortion is not reliable . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , estimates of the incidence of kb_abortion must kb_beryllium made without determining certainty related to standard kb_error .the kb_grammatical_number of abortions performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in recent years , with 41.6 million having been performed in 2003 and 43.8 million having been performed in 2008. the kb_abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women , though kb_it was 24 per 1000 women for kb_developed_countries and 29 per 1000 women for developing countries . the same kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2012 kb_science indicated that in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 , the estimated kb_abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21 % worldwide , with 26 % in kb_developed_countries and 20 % in developing countries .on average , the incidence of kb_abortion is similar in countries with restrictive kb_abortion laws and those with more kb_liberal_christianity access to kb_abortion . however , restrictive kb_abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely . the kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion rate in developing countries is partly attributable to lack of access to kb_modern_history contraceptives ; according to the kb_guttmacher_institute institute , providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38,000 fewer kb_maternal_death from kb_unsafe_abortion kb_abortion annually worldwide .the rate of kb_law , kb_#induced kb_abortion varies extensively worldwide . according to the report of employees of kb_guttmacher_institute institute kb_it ranged from 7 per 1000 women ( kb_germany and kb_switzerland ) to 30 per 1000 women ( kb_estonia ) in countries with complete kb_statistics in 2008. the kb_hierarchical_proportion of pregnancies that ended in kb_#induced kb_abortion ranged from about 10 % ( kb_israel , kb_netherlands kb_netherlands and kb_switzerland ) to 30 % ( kb_estonia ) in the same kb_group_(periodic_table) , though kb_it might kb_beryllium as kb_high_middle_ages as 36 % kb_hungarian_revolution_of_1919 kb_hungary and kb_romania , whose kb_statistics were deemed incomplete .an kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) kb_science in kb_2002_australian_open concluded that about half of women having abortions were using kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_birth_control at the kb_time_(magazine) of becoming kb_pregnant . inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms and three-quarters of those using the kb_combined_oral_contraceptive_pill pill ; 42 % of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage . the kb_guttmacher_institute institute estimated that `` most abortions in the united kb_sovereign_state are obtained by minority women '' because minority women `` have much higher kb_rates_(tax) of kb_unintended_pregnancy kb_pregnancy '' .the kb_abortion rate may also kb_beryllium expressed as the average kb_grammatical_number of abortions kb_a woman has during her reproductive years ;
