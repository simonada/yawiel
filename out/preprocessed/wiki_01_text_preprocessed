kb_asciikb_ascii ( ) , abbreviated from kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) standard kb_code for kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) interchange , is kb_a kb_character_encoding standard for kb_electronic_computer kb_communication . kb_ascii kb_code_(cryptography) represent text in computers , kb_telecommunications_equipment , and kb_other_(philosophy) devices . most kb_modern_history character-encoding schemes are based on kb_ascii , although they support many additional kb_character_(computing) .kb_ascii is the traditional kb_toponymy for the encoding system ; kb_the_internet kb_internet_assigned_numbers_authority kb_grammatical_number kb_authority ( iana ) prefers the updated kb_toponymy us-ascii , which clarifies that this system was kb_adaptation in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) and based on the typographical kb_symbols predominantly in use there .kb_ascii is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_list_of_ieee_milestoneskb_ascii was kb_adaptation from kb_telegraph_code . its kb_first_trimester commercial use was as kb_a seven-bit kb_teleprinter kb_code promoted by kb_bell kb_big_data kb_service_(economics) . kb_cold_working on the kb_ascii standard began on kb_october 6 , kb_u.s._presidential_election,_1960 , with the kb_first_trimester meeting of the kb_american_standards_association kb_continental_association 's ( asa ) ( now the kb_american_national_standards_institute kb_corporate_social_responsibility institute or kb_american_national_standards_institute ) x3.2 subcommittee . the kb_first_trimester edition of the standard was published in 1963 , underwent kb_a kb_major_(united_states) revision during 1967 , and experienced its most recent update during 1986. compared to kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet kb_telegraph kb_code_(cryptography) , the kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_bell kb_code and kb_ascii were both kb_totally_ordered_set for more convenient kb_sorting_algorithm ( i.e. , alphabetization ) of lists , and added features for devices kb_other_(philosophy) than teleprinters .originally based on the kb_english_alphabet , kb_ascii encodes 128 specified kb_character_(computing) into seven-bit integers as shown by the kb_ascii chart above . ninety-five of the encoded kb_character_(computing) are printable : these include the digits `` 0 '' to `` 9 '' , kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_a '' to `` kb_carboxybenzyl '' , kb_upper_case kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_a '' to `` kb_carboxybenzyl '' , and punctuation kb_symbols . in kb_addition , the original kb_ascii specification included 33 non-printing control kb_code_(cryptography) which originated with kb_teleprinter machines ; most of these are now obsolete , although kb_a few are still commonly used , such as the kb_carriage_return return , kb_line_feed and kb_tab_key#tab_characters kb_code_(cryptography) .for example , kb_lower_case `` kb_iodine '' would kb_beryllium represented in the kb_ascii encoding by kb_binary_number 1101001 = kb_hexadecimal 69 ( `` kb_iodine '' is the ninth kb_letter_(alphabet) ) = kb_decimalthe kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) standard kb_code for kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) interchange ( kb_ascii ) was kb_adaptation under the auspices of kb_a committee of the kb_american_standards_association kb_continental_association ( asa ) , called the x3 committee , by its x3.2 ( later x3l2 ) subcommittee , and later by that subcommittee 's x3.2.4 kb_working_group kb_group_(periodic_table) ( now kb_incits ) . the asa became the kb_united_states_of_america_standards_institute of kb_americas kb_corporate_social_responsibility institute ( usasi ) and ultimately the kb_american_national_standards_institute kb_corporate_social_responsibility institute ( kb_american_national_standards_institute ) .with the kb_other_(philosophy) special kb_character_(computing) and control kb_code_(cryptography) filled in , kb_ascii was published as asa x3.4-1963 , leaving 28 kb_code positions without any assigned kb_meaning_(linguistics) , reserved for future standardization , and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) unassigned kb_control_code kb_code . there was some kb_abortion_debate at the kb_time_(magazine) whether there should kb_beryllium more control kb_character_(computing) rather than the kb_lower_case kb_alphabet . the indecision did not last kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) : during may 1963 the ccitt working party on the kb_new_world kb_telegraph kb_alphabet kb_anatolian_hypothesis to assign kb_lower_case kb_character_(computing) to `` sticks '' 6 and 7 , and kb_international_organization_for_standardization organization for standardization tc 97 sc kb_alkaline_earth_metal voted during kb_october to incorporate the change into its draft standard . the x3.2.4 task kb_group_(periodic_table) voted its approval for the change to kb_ascii at its may 1963 meeting . locating the kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) in `` sticks '' 6 and 7 caused the kb_character_(computing) to differ in kb_bit_(horse) kb_pattern from the kb_upper_egypt case by kb_a kb_single_bond kb_bit_(horse) , which simplified kb_case-insensitive kb_character_(computing) matching and the kb_construction of keyboards and kb_computer_printer .the x3 committee made kb_other_(philosophy) changes , including kb_other_(philosophy) kb_new_world kb_character_(computing) ( the kb_brace_(punctuation) and kb_vertical_bar bar kb_character_(computing) ) , renaming some control kb_character_(computing) ( som became start of header ( soh ) ) and moving or removing others ( ru was removed ) . kb_ascii was subsequently updated as usas x3.4-1967 , then usas x3.4-1968 , kb_american_national_standards_institute x3.4-1977 , and finally , kb_american_national_standards_institute x3.4-1986 .revisions of the kb_ascii standard :in the x3.15 standard , the x3 committee also addressed how kb_ascii should kb_beryllium transmitted ( kb_least_significant_bit significant kb_bit_(horse) kb_first_trimester ) , and how kb_it should kb_beryllium recorded on perforated tape . they kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_a kb_9-track standard for kb_magnetic tape , and attempted to deal with some kb_punched_card card formats .the x3.2 subcommittee kb_aircraft_design_process kb_ascii based on the kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet kb_teleprinter encoding kb_systems_analysis . like kb_other_(philosophy) kb_character_(computing) encodings , kb_ascii specifies kb_a correspondence between kb_digital_data kb_bit_(horse) patterns and kb_character_(computing) kb_symbols ( i.e . kb_graphemes and control kb_character_(computing) ) . this allows kb_digital_data devices to communicate with each kb_other_(philosophy) and to process , store , and communicate character-oriented kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) such as written kb_hunnic_language . before kb_ascii was kb_adaptation , the encodings in use included 26 kb_english_alphabet kb_character_(computing) , 10 numerical digits , and from 11 to 25 special graphic kb_symbols . to include all these , and control kb_character_(computing) compatible with the kb_ccitt consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique ( ccitt ) international kb_telegraph kb_alphabet no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal ( kb_ita2 ) standard of 1924 , kb_fieldata ( 1956 ) , and early kb_ebcdic ( 1963 ) , more than 64 kb_code_(cryptography) were required for kb_ascii .kb_ita2 were in kb_turn_(geometry) based on the 5-bit kb_telegraph_code kb_émile_baudot baudot invented in 1870 and kb_patented in 1874 .the committee debated the possibility of kb_a kb_shift_code kb_function_(biology) ( like in kb_ita2 ) , which would allow more than 64 kb_code_(cryptography) to kb_beryllium represented by kb_a kb_six-bit_character_code kb_code . in kb_a shifted kb_code , some kb_character_(computing) kb_code_(cryptography) determine choices between options for the following kb_character_(computing) kb_code_(cryptography) . kb_it allows compact encoding , but is less reliable for kb_data_transmission , as an kb_error in transmitting the kb_shift_code kb_code typically makes kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) part of the kb_transmission_coefficient unreadable . the kb_corporate_social_responsibility committee decided against shifting , and kb_sulfate kb_ascii required at least kb_a seven-bit kb_code .the committee considered an kb_eight-bit kb_code , since eight bits ( octets ) would allow kb_2_(number) four-bit patterns to efficiently encode kb_2_(number) digits with kb_binary-coded_decimal kb_decimal . however , kb_it would require all kb_data_transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice . the committee voted to use kb_a seven-bit kb_code to minimize costs associated with kb_data_transmission . since perforated tape at the kb_time_(magazine) could record eight bits in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_positional_notation , kb_it also allowed for kb_a kb_parity_bit kb_bit_(horse) for kb_error_checking if desired . kb_eight-bit machines ( with octets as the native kb_big_data kb_type_(biology) ) that did not use parity checking typically kb_set_(mythology) the eighth kb_bit_(horse) to 0. in some kb_computer_printer , the kb_high_middle_ages kb_bit_(horse) was used to enable kb_italics printing .the kb_code itself was patterned kb_sulfate that most control kb_code_(cryptography) were together and all graphic kb_code_(cryptography) were together , for ease of identification . the kb_first_trimester kb_2_(number) kb_sulfate called `` kb_ascii sticks '' ( 32 positions ) were reserved for control kb_character_(computing) . the `` kb_space '' kb_character_(computing) had to come before graphics to make kb_sorting_algorithm easier , kb_sulfate kb_it became kb_positional_notation 20 ; for the same kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits . the committee decided kb_it was important to support kb_upper_case kb_sixbit_code_pages alphabets , and chose to kb_pattern kb_ascii kb_sulfate kb_it could kb_beryllium kb_redox easily to kb_a usable 64-character kb_set_(mythology) of graphic kb_code_(cryptography) , as was done in the kb_dec_sixbit kb_code ( 1963 ) . kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) were therefore not interleaved with kb_upper_case . to keep options kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance for kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) and kb_other_(philosophy) graphics , the special and numeric kb_code_(cryptography) were arranged before the kb_letter_(alphabet) , and the kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_a '' was placed in kb_positional_notation 41 to match the draft of the corresponding kb_kingdom_of_great_britain standard . the digits 0–9 are prefixed with 011 , but the remaining kb_nibble bits correspond to their respective values in kb_binary_number , making kb_conversion_to_christianity with kb_binary-coded_decimal kb_decimal straightforward .many of the non-alphanumeric kb_character_(computing) were positioned to correspond to their shifted kb_positional_notation on typewriters ; an important subtlety is that these were based on `` kb_mechanics '' typewriters , not `` electric '' typewriters . kb_mechanics typewriters followed the standard kb_set_(mythology) by the remington no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal ( 1878 ) , the kb_first_trimester kb_typewriter with kb_a kb_shift_code kb_key_(cryptography) , and the shifted values of codice_1 were codice_2 early typewriters omitted `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' , using `` kb_oxygen '' ( kb_capital_letter `` kb_oxygen '' ) and `` l '' ( kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) `` l '' ) instead , but codice_3 and codice_4 pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common . thus , in kb_ascii codice_5 were placed in the kb_second_language stick , positions 1–5 , corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent stick . the parentheses could not correspond to `` 9 '' and `` 0 '' , however , because the kb_place_of_articulation corresponding to `` 0 '' was taken by the kb_space kb_character_(computing) . this was accommodated by removing codice_6 ( kb_underscore ) from `` 6 '' and shifting the remaining kb_character_(computing) , which corresponded to many kb_european_eel typewriters that placed the parentheses with `` kb_group_8_element '' and `` 9 '' . this discrepancy from typewriters kb_light-emitting_diode to bit-paired keyboards , notably the kb_teletype_model_33 kb_rutherford_model 33 , which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to kb_ascii , not to traditional kb_mechanics typewriters . electric typewriters , notably the kb_ibm_selectric ( 1961 ) , used kb_a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers following the kb_ibm_pc ( 1981 ) , especially kb_model_m ( kb_1984_world_rally_championship_season ) and thus kb_shift_code values for kb_symbols on kb_modern_history keyboards do not correspond as closely to the kb_ascii table as kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet keyboards did . the codice_7 pair also dates to the no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal , and the codice_8 pairs were used on some keyboards ( others , including the no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal , did not kb_shift_code codice_9 ( comma ) or codice_10 ( kb_full_stop stop ) kb_sulfate they could kb_beryllium used in kb_upper_case without unshifting ) . however , kb_ascii split the codice_11 pair ( dating to no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal ) , and rearranged mathematical kb_symbols ( varied conventions , commonly codice_12 ) to codice_13 .some common kb_character_(computing) were not included , notably codice_14 , while codice_15 were included as kb_diacritics for international use , and codice_16 for mathematical use , together with the kb_simple_polygon kb_line_(geometry) kb_character_(computing) codice_17 ( in kb_addition to common codice_18 ) . the `` @ '' kb_symbol was not used in kb_continental_europe and the committee expected kb_it would kb_beryllium replaced by an accented `` à '' in the kb_france variation , kb_sulfate the `` @ '' was placed in kb_positional_notation 40 , kb_right-wing_politics before the kb_letter_(alphabet) kb_a .the control kb_code_(cryptography) felt kb_essential_element for kb_data_transmission were the start of message ( som ) , end of address ( eoa ) , kb_end_of_message of message ( eom ) , end of kb_transmission_coefficient ( eot ) , `` kb_world_health_organization are you ? '' ( wru ) , `` are you ? '' ( ru ) , kb_a reserved kb_analyzer control ( dc0 ) , synchronous idle ( sync ) , and acknowledge ( ack ) . these were positioned to maximize the kb_hamming_distance kb_distance between their kb_bit_(horse) patterns .ascii-code kb_order_(biology) is also called `` asciibetical '' kb_order_(biology) . kb_collation of kb_big_data is sometimes done in this kb_order_(biology) rather than `` standard '' kb_alphabetical_order kb_order_(biology) ( kb_collating_sequence sequence ) . the main deviations in kb_ascii kb_order_(biology) are :an intermediate kb_order_(biology) converts kb_upper_case kb_letter_(alphabet) to kb_lower_case before comparing kb_ascii values .kb_ascii reserves the kb_first_trimester 32 kb_code_(cryptography) ( kb_grammatical_number 0–31 kb_decimal ) for control kb_character_(computing) : kb_code_(cryptography) originally kb_intention not to represent printable kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) , but rather to control devices ( such as kb_computer_printer ) that make use of kb_ascii , or to provide kb_metadata about kb_big_data streams such as those stored on kb_magnetic tape .for example , kb_character_(computing) 10 represents the `` kb_line_feed '' kb_function_(biology) ( which kb_causes_of_autism kb_a printer to advance its paper ) , and kb_character_(computing) kb_group_8_element represents `` backspace '' . refers to control kb_character_(computing) that do not include kb_carriage_return return , kb_line_feed or kb_whitespace_(computer_science) as non-whitespace control kb_character_(computing) . except for the control kb_character_(computing) that kb_linguistic_prescription kb_elementary_school line-oriented formatting , kb_ascii does not define any kb_mechanism_(biology) for describing the kb_structure or kb_appearance_(philosophy) of text within kb_a document . kb_other_(philosophy) schemes , such as markup languages , address page and document layout and formatting .the original kb_ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) . the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional , for example where kb_a kb_character_(computing) would kb_beryllium used slightly differently on kb_a kb_computer_terminal link than on kb_a kb_data_stream , and sometimes accidental , for example with the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of `` kb_delete_key '' .probably the most influential kb_single_bond kb_analyzer on the kb_interpretation_(logic) of these kb_character_(computing) was the kb_teletype_model_33 kb_rutherford_model 33 asr , which was kb_a printing kb_computer_terminal with an kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance kb_punched_tape tape reader/punch option . kb_punched_tape tape was kb_a very popular kb_list_of_art_mediums for long-term kb_program_(computing) storage until the 1980s , less costly and in some ways less fragile than kb_magnetic tape . in kb_particular , the kb_teletype_model_33 kb_rutherford_model 33 kb_machine assignments for kb_code_(cryptography) 17 ( control-q , dc1 , also known as xon ) , 19 ( control-s , dc3 , also known as xoff ) , and 127 ( kb_delete_key ) became kb_de_facto kb_corporate_social_responsibility . the kb_rutherford_model 33 was also notable for taking the description of control-g ( kb_code 7 , bel , kb_meaning_(linguistics) audibly alert the operator ) literally , as the kb_units_of_measurement contained an actual kb_bell which kb_it rang when kb_it received kb_a bel kb_character_(computing) . because the keytop for the kb_oxygen kb_key_(cryptography) also showed kb_a left-arrow kb_symbol ( from ascii-1963 , which had this kb_character_(computing) instead of kb_underscore ) , kb_a noncompliant use of kb_code 15 ( control-o , kb_shift_code in ) interpreted as `` kb_delete_key previous kb_character_(computing) '' was also kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by many early timesharing kb_systems_analysis but eventually became neglected .when kb_a teletype 33 asr equipped with the automatic kb_punched_tape tape kb_reader_(academic_rank) received kb_a control-s ( xoff , an abbreviation for transmit off ) , kb_it caused the tape kb_reader_(academic_rank) to stop ; receiving control-q ( xon , `` transmit on '' ) caused the tape kb_reader_(academic_rank) to resume . this technique became kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by several early kb_apollo_guidance_computer operating kb_systems_analysis as kb_a `` handshaking '' signal warning kb_a sender to stop kb_transmission_coefficient because of impending kb_arithmetic_overflow ; kb_it persists to this day in many kb_systems_analysis as kb_a kb_manual_(music) output control technique . on some kb_systems_analysis control-s retains its kb_meaning_(linguistics) but control-q is replaced by kb_a kb_second_language control-s to resume output . the 33 asr also could kb_beryllium configured to employ control-r ( dc2 ) and control-t ( dc4 ) to start and stop the tape kb_punch_(magazine) ; on some units equipped with this kb_function_(biology) , the corresponding kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) lettering on the keycap above the kb_letter_(alphabet) was tape and tape respectively .the teletype could not move the kb_human_head backwards , kb_sulfate kb_it did not put kb_a kb_key_(cryptography) on the keyboard to send kb_a bs ( backspace ) . instead there was kb_a kb_key_(cryptography) marked `` rubout '' that sent kb_code 127 ( del ) . the purpose of this kb_key_(cryptography) was to erase mistakes in kb_a hand-typed kb_punched_tape tape : the operator had to push kb_a kb_button_(control) on the tape kb_punch_(magazine) to back kb_it up , then kb_type_(biology) the rubout , which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with kb_a kb_character_(computing) that was kb_intention to kb_beryllium ignored . teletypes were commonly used for the less-expensive computers from kb_digital_equipment_corporation corporation , kb_sulfate these kb_systems_analysis had to use the kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance kb_key_(cryptography) and thus the del kb_code to erase the previous kb_character_(computing) . because of this , kb_declination kb_video terminals ( by default ) sent the del kb_code for the kb_key_(cryptography) marked `` backspace '' while the kb_key_(cryptography) marked `` kb_delete_key '' sent an kb_escape_character sequence , while many kb_other_(philosophy) terminals sent bs for the backspace kb_key_(cryptography) . the kb_unix kb_computer_terminal driver could only use kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_code to back up , this could kb_beryllium kb_set_(mythology) to bs `` or '' del , but not both , resulting in kb_a very kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) period of annoyance where you had to correct kb_it depending on what kb_computer_terminal you were using ( kb_modern_history kb_electron_shells using kb_readline kb_natural_language_understanding both kb_code_(cryptography) ) . the assumption that no kb_key_(cryptography) sent kb_a bs caused control+h to kb_beryllium used for kb_other_(philosophy) purposes , such as kb_a `` help '' kb_command_economy in emacs .many more of the control kb_code_(cryptography) have been given meanings quite different from their original ones . the `` escape '' kb_character_(computing) ( esc , kb_code 27 ) , for example , was kb_intention originally to allow sending kb_other_(philosophy) control kb_character_(computing) as literals instead of invoking their kb_meaning_(linguistics) . this is the same kb_meaning_(linguistics) of `` escape '' encountered in url encodings , kb_c_(programming_language) kb_string_section , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_systems_analysis where certain kb_character_(computing) have kb_a reserved kb_meaning_(linguistics) . over kb_time_(magazine) this kb_meaning_(linguistics) has been co-opted and has eventually been changed . in kb_modern_history use , an esc sent to the kb_computer_terminal usually indicates the start of kb_a kb_command_economy sequence usually in the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_a so-called `` kb_ansi_escape_code kb_code '' ( or , more properly , kb_a `` kb_control_sequence_introducer sequence introducer '' ) from ecma-48 ( kb_1972_wimbledon_championships ) and its successors , beginning with esc followed by kb_a `` < nowiki > [ < /nowiki > '' ( left-bracket ) kb_character_(computing) . an esc sent from the kb_computer_terminal is most often used as an kb_out-of-band_data kb_character_(computing) used to terminate an operation , as in the kb_text_editor_and_corrector and kb_vi text editors . in kb_graphical_user_interface kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) interface ( kb_graphical_user_interface ) and kb_window_(computing) kb_systems_analysis , esc generally kb_causes_of_autism an kb_application_(computing) to abort its kb_electric_current operation or to kb_exit_(system_call) ( terminate ) altogether .the inherent ambiguity of many control kb_character_(computing) , combined with their historical usage , created kb_problems_(aristotle) when transferring `` kb_plain_text text '' kb_file_(tool) between kb_systems_analysis . the best example of this is the kb_newline problem on various operating kb_systems_analysis . kb_teleprinter machines required that kb_a kb_line_(geometry) of text kb_beryllium terminated with both `` kb_carriage_return return '' ( which moves the printhead to kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the kb_line_(geometry) ) and `` kb_line_feed '' ( which advances the paper kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_line_(geometry) without moving the printhead ) . the kb_toponymy `` kb_carriage_return return '' comes from the kb_fact that on kb_a kb_manual_(music) kb_typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the kb_positional_notation where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary . the entire carriage had to kb_beryllium pushed ( returned ) to the kb_right-wing_politics in kb_order_(biology) to kb_positional_notation the kb_left-wing_politics margin of the paper for the kb_next kb_line_(geometry) .kb_declination operating kb_systems_analysis ( kb_os/8 , kb_rt-11 , kb_rsx-11 , kb_rsts/e , kb_tops-10 , etc . ) used both kb_character_(computing) to kb_mark_waugh the end of kb_a kb_line_(geometry) kb_sulfate that the console kb_analyzer ( originally kb_teleprinter machines ) would kb_cold_working . by the kb_time_(magazine) so-called `` kb_glass ttys '' ( later called crts or terminals ) came along , the kb_fan_convention was kb_sulfate kb_water_well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the kb_fan_convention . when kb_gary_kildall kildall created kb_cp/m kb_he_(letter) was inspired by some kb_command_economy kb_line_(geometry) interface conventions used in kb_declination 's kb_rt-11 . until the introduction of kb_pc_dos kb_dos in 1981 , kb_ibm had no kb_hand in this because their 1970s operating kb_systems_analysis used kb_ebcdic instead of kb_ascii and they were oriented toward punch-card input and kb_line_(geometry) printer output on which the kb_concept of kb_carriage_return return was meaningless . kb_ibm 's kb_pc_dos kb_dos ( also marketed as kb_ms-dos by kb_microsoft ) inherited the kb_fan_convention by kb_virtue of kb_being loosely based on kb_cp/m , and kb_microsoft_windows inherited kb_it from kb_ms-dos .unfortunately , requiring kb_2_(number) kb_character_(computing) to kb_mark_waugh the end of kb_a kb_line_(geometry) introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each kb_character_(computing) when encountered alone . to simplify matters kb_plain_text text kb_big_data streams , including kb_file_(tool) , on kb_multics used kb_line_feed ( lf ) alone as kb_a kb_line_(geometry) kb_terminator_(solar) . kb_unix and kb_unix-like kb_systems_analysis , and kb_amiga kb_systems_analysis , kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome this kb_fan_convention from kb_multics . the original kb_macintosh_os , kb_apple_dos , and kb_prodos , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , used kb_carriage_return return ( cr ) alone as kb_a kb_line_(geometry) kb_terminator_(solar) ; however , since kb_apple_inc. replaced these operating kb_systems_analysis with the unix-based kb_macos kb_operating_system system , they now use kb_line_feed ( lf ) as kb_water_well . the kb_radio shack kb_trs-80 also used kb_a lone cr to terminate lines .computers attached to the kb_arpanet included machines running operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_tops-10 and kb_tops-20#tenex using cr-lf kb_line_(geometry) endings , machines running operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_multics using lf kb_line_(geometry) endings , and machines running operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_os/360 that represented lines as kb_a kb_character_(computing) count followed by the kb_character_(computing) of the kb_line_(geometry) and that used kb_ebcdic rather than kb_ascii . the kb_telnet protocol kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity an kb_ascii `` kb_network_virtual_terminal virtual kb_computer_terminal '' ( nvt ) , kb_sulfate that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and kb_character_(computing) sets could kb_beryllium kb_catalyst_support by transmitting kb_a standard text kb_text_formatting over the network . kb_telnet used kb_ascii along with cr-lf kb_line_(geometry) endings , and software using kb_other_(philosophy) conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt . the kb_file_transfer_protocol transfer protocol kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome the kb_telnet protocol , including use of the kb_network_virtual_terminal virtual kb_computer_terminal , for use when transmitting commands and transferring kb_big_data in the default kb_ascii kb_musical_mode . this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols , and to kb_other_(philosophy) network protocols , such as those used for e-mail and the kb_world_wide_web kb_world_wide_web , on kb_systems_analysis not using the nvt 's cr-lf line-ending kb_fan_convention .the pdp-6 monitor , and its pdp-10 successor kb_tops-10 , used control-z ( sub ) as an kb_end-of-file indication for input from kb_a kb_computer_terminal . some operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_cp/m tracked file kb_length only in units of kb_disk_(mathematics) kb_periodic_table_block and used control-z to kb_mark_waugh the end of the actual text in the file . for these reasons , eof , or kb_end-of-file , was used colloquially and conventionally as kb_a kb_three-letter_acronym kb_acronym for control-z instead of substitute . the end-of-text kb_code ( kb_end-of-text_character ) , also known as kb_control-c , was inappropriate for kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of reasons , while using kb_carboxybenzyl as the kb_control_code kb_code to end kb_a file is analogous to kb_it ending the kb_alphabet and serves as kb_a very convenient kb_mnemonic_device kb_aid . kb_a kb_history common and still prevalent

represent all variants , including those that do not preserve kb_ascii 's character-map in the 7-bit range . furthermore , the kb_ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as kb_ascii .from early in its development , kb_ascii was kb_intention to kb_beryllium just kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of several national variants of an international kb_character_(computing) kb_code standard .kb_other_(philosophy) international kb_standardization have ratified kb_character_(computing) encodings such as kb_iso_646 ( 1967 ) that are kb_identical_particles or nearly kb_identical_particles to

kb_character_(computing) to several kb_code points reserved for `` national use '' . however , the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii-1963 and kb_international_organization_for_standardization 's kb_first_trimester acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused kb_ascii 's choices for the national use kb_character_(computing) to seem to kb_beryllium kb_de_facto kb_corporate_social_responsibility for the kb_world_war_ii , causing kb_confusion and incompatibility once kb_other_(philosophy) countries

their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use . many programmers kept their computers on us-ascii , kb_sulfate plain-text in kb_sweden , kb_german_language etc . ( for example , in e-mail or kb_usenet ) contained `` { , } '' and similar variants in the middle of kb_lexical_semantics , something those programmers got used to . for example , kb_a kb_sweden kb_programmer mailing another kb_programmer asking if they should kb_go_(game) for lunch , could get `` kb_neutron { jag har sm|rg } sar '' as the answer , which should kb_beryllium `` nä jag har

kb_adaptation their own kb_8-bit kb_character_(computing) sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs , and often filled in some or all of the control kb_character_(computing) from 0 to 31 with more

kb_systems_analysis is probably unique among post-1970 kb_code_(cryptography) in kb_being based on ascii-1963 , instead of the more common ascii-1967 , such as found on the kb_zx_spectrum_character_set kb_visible_spectrum kb_apollo_guidance_computer . kb_atari_2600 kb_8-bit computers and kb_galaksija_(computer)#character_rom computers also used kb_ascii variants .the kb_ibm_pc kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity kb_code_page_437 437 , which replaced the control kb_character_(computing) with graphic kb_symbols such as kb_emoticon faces , and mapped additional graphic

kb_letter_(alphabet) and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics , more like kb_modern_history kb_character_(computing) sets .the kb_iso/iec_8859 8859 standard ( kb_derived_trait from the dec-mcs ) finally provided kb_a standard that most kb_systems_analysis copied ( at least as accurately as they copied kb_ascii , but with many substitutions ) . kb_a popular further kb_extension_(kinesiology) kb_aircraft_design_process by kb_microsoft , kb_windows-1252 ( often mislabeled as kb_iso-8859-1 ) , added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text

common .iso/iec 4873 introduced 32 additional control kb_code_(cryptography) kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity in the 80–9f kb_hexadecimal range , as part of extending the 7-bit kb_ascii encoding to

kb_theory_of_forms have begun to supplant kb_iso/iec_8859 8859 and kb_ascii rapidly in many environments . while kb_ascii is limited to 128 kb_character_(computing) , kb_unicode and the ucs support more kb_character_(computing) by separating the concepts of unique identification ( using kb_natural_number kb_grammatical_number called `` kb_code points '' ) and encoding ( to 8- , kb_16-bit or kb_32-bit kb_binary_number formats , called kb_utf-8 , kb_utf-16 and kb_utf-32 ) .kb_ascii was incorporated into the kb_unicode ( kb_albanian_parliamentary_election,_1991 ) kb_character_(computing)

kahrs said that `` our animators can change things , actually erase away the cg underlayer if they want , and change the profile of the kb_arm . ''kb_3d_computer_graphics animation is kb_digital_media modeled and manipulated by an kb_animator . the kb_animator usually starts by creating kb_a 3d kb_polygon_mesh to manipulate . kb_a mesh typically includes many kb_vertex_(geometry) that are connected by edges and faces , which give the visual kb_appearance_(philosophy) of kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism to kb_a 3d kb_space_debris or 3d environment . sometimes , the mesh is given an internal kb_digital_data skeletal kb_structure called an kb_armature_(computer_animation) that can kb_beryllium used to control the mesh by weighting the kb_vertex_(geometry) . this process is called rigging and can kb_beryllium used in conjunction with keyframes to create kb_movement_(sign_language) .kb_other_(philosophy) techniques can kb_beryllium kb_applied_science , mathematical functions ( e.g. , kb_gravity_(2013_film) , kb_grammatical_particle simulations ) , simulated fur or hair , and effects , kb_fire_(classical_element) and kb_fluid_animationan kb_animator is an kb_artist kb_world_health_organization creates kb_a visual sequence ( or kb_audio-visual if added kb_sound ) of kb_cross-platform_software sequential images that generate the illusion of kb_movement_(sign_language) , that is , an animation . animations are currently in many areas of kb_technology and kb_video , such as kb_film , kb_television , kb_video_games or kb_the_internet kb_internet . generally , these works require the collaboration of several animators . the methods to create these images depend on the kb_animator and kb_carpel that kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) wants to achieve ( with images generated by kb_apollo_guidance_computer , manually ... ) .animators can kb_beryllium divided into animators of kb_character_(computing) ( artists kb_world_health_organization are specialized in the movements , kb_dialogue and acting of the kb_character_(computing) ) and animators of special effects ( for example vehicles , kb_machinery or kb_natural_number kb_phenomenon such as kb_water , kb_snow , kb_rain ) .the creation of non-trivial animation works ( i.e. , longer than kb_a few seconds ) has kb_adaptation as kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_filmmaking , with certain unique aspects . kb_trait_(biology) common to both live-action and animated kb_feature_film kb_adventure_film are labor-intensity and kb_high_middle_ages production costs .the most important difference is that once kb_a kb_film is in the production kb_phase_(matter) , the kb_marginal_cost cost of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) more shot is higher for animated kb_adventure_film than live-action kb_adventure_film . kb_it is relatively easy for kb_a director to kb_amplitude-shift_keying for kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) more kb_take during kb_principal_photography photography of kb_a live-action kb_film , but every kb_take on an animated kb_film must kb_beryllium manually rendered by animators ( although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by kb_modern_history kb_computer_animation ) . kb_it is pointless for kb_a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating kb_a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the kb_film . thus , animation studios starting with kb_walt_disney_animation_studios began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where kb_storyboard artists develop every kb_single_bond scene through storyboards , then handing the kb_film over to the animators only after the production team is kb_satisfiability that all the scenes make kb_word_sense as kb_a whole . while live-action kb_adventure_film are now also storyboarded , they enjoy more kb_latitude to depart from storyboards ( i.e. , kb_real-time_computing improvisation ) .another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain kb_a kb_film 's consistency from start to finish , even as kb_adventure_film have grown longer and teams have grown larger . animators , like all artists , necessarily have kb_individual kb_art_movement , but must subordinate their individuality in kb_a kb_consistent way to whatever kb_carpel is employed on kb_a kb_particular kb_film . since the early 1980s , teams of about 500 to 600 kb_people_(american_magazine) , of whom 50 to 70 are animators , typically have created feature-length animated kb_adventure_film . kb_it is relatively easy for kb_2_(number) or kb_triliteral artists to match their kb_art_movement ; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult .this problem is usually solved by having kb_a separate kb_group_(periodic_table) of visual development artists develop an overall kb_look_(american_magazine) and palette for each kb_film before animation begins . kb_character_(computing) designers on the visual development team draw kb_rutherford_model sheets to show how each kb_character_(computing) should kb_look_(american_magazine) like with different facial expressions , posed in different positions , and viewed from different angles . on traditionally animated projects , maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators kb_episcopal_see how kb_character_(computing) would kb_look_(american_magazine) from different angles .unlike live-action kb_adventure_film , animated kb_adventure_film were traditionally kb_adaptation beyond the synopsis stage through the kb_storyboard kb_text_formatting ; the kb_storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the kb_film . in the early kb_1960s_in_the_united_states , animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write kb_screenplays ( while also continuing to use story departments ) and kb_screenplays had become commonplace for animated kb_adventure_film by the late 1980s .criticism of animation has been common in kb_medes and kb_film since its kb_inception_(film) . with its popularity , kb_a kb_prespa_lake amount of criticism has arisen , especially animated kb_feature_film kb_adventure_film . many concerns of kb_cultural_anthropology kb_representation_(arts) , kb_psychology effects on children have been brought up around the animation kb_industry , which has remained rather kb_politics_of_albania unchanged and stagnant since its kb_inception_(film) into kb_mainstream_(terminology) kb_albanian_culture .as with any kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_medes , animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field . the original awards for animation were presented by the kb_academy_of_motion_picture_arts_and_sciences kb_motion_(physics) picture kb_arts and kb_sciences for animated shorts from the year 1932 , during the 5th kb_academy_awards kb_function_(biology) . the kb_first_trimester winner of the kb_academy_awards was the short `` kb_flowers_and_trees and kb_trees '' , kb_a production by kb_walt_disney_productions kb_walt_disney_animation_studios productions . the kb_academy_awards for kb_a feature-length animated kb_motion_(physics) picture was only instituted for the year 2001 , and awarded during the 74th kb_academy_awards in 2002. kb_it was won by the kb_film `` kb_shrek '' , produced by kb_dreamworks and kb_pacific_data_images images . disney/pixar have produced the most kb_adventure_film either to win or kb_beryllium nominated for the award . the kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of both awards can kb_beryllium obtained here :several kb_other_(philosophy) countries have instituted an award for best-animated kb_feature_film as part of their national kb_film awards : kb_africa_movie_academy_award_for_best_animation kb_academy_awards for best animation ( since kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 ) , kb_bafta_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film ( since kb_winter_olympics_2006 ) , kb_césar_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film ( since 2011 ) , kb_golden_rooster_award_for_best_animation award for best animation ( since 1981 ) , kb_goya_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film ( since 1989 ) , kb_japan_academy_prize_for_animation_of_the_year prize for animation of the year ( since kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final ) , kb_national_film_award_for_best_animated_film kb_film award for best animated kb_film ( since kb_winter_olympics_2006 ) . also since kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final , the kb_asia_pacific_screen_award_for_best_animated_feature_film kb_screening_(medicine) award for best animated kb_feature_film has been awarded at the kb_asia_pacific_screen_awards kb_screening_(medicine) awards . since kb_2009_in_science , the kb_european_film_awards awards have awarded the kb_european_film_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film .the kb_annie_award award is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation . unlike the kb_academy_awards , the annie awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any kb_other_(philosophy) field of technical and artistic endeavor . they were re-organized in kb_1992_davis_cup to create kb_a kb_new_world field for best animated kb_i_shot_andy_warhol . the 1990s winners were dominated by walt kb_walt_disney_animation_studios , however , newer studios , kb_light-emitting_diode by kb_pixar & kb_dreamworks , have now begun to consistently vie for this award . the kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of awardees is as follows :category : cartooningcategory : kb_article_(grammar) containing kb_video kb_clips_(software)category : kb_film and kb_video technologyapollokb_apollo_program ( kb_attica , kb_ionic_crystal , and kb_homeric_greek : , `` apollōn '' ( ) ;

the kb_observation of the omens of the days . the inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from kb_anatolia . the kb_ritualism_in_the_church_of_england belonged to kb_apollo_program from kb_operation_barbarossa beginning . the kb_greeks created the kb_legalism_(western_philosophy) , the supervision of the kb_order_(biology) of the kb_deity , and the demand for kb_moderation and kb_harmony . kb_apollo_program became the kb_god of shining youth , kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_beauty , kb_fine_(penalty) kb_arts , kb_philosophy , kb_moderation , spiritual-life , the protector of

magicians were also called `` seer-doctors '' ( ) , and they used an ecstatic prophetic kb_art which was used exactly by the kb_god kb_apollo_program at the kb_oracle_machine .in the `` kb_iliad '' , kb_apollo_program is the healer under the kb_deity , but kb_he_(letter) is also the bringer of kb_disease and kb_death with kb_histidine arrows , similar to the kb_function_(biology) of the kb_vedas

month `` apellaios '' in northwest kb_ancient_greek calendars . the family-festival was dedicated to kb_apollo_program ( kb_dorians : ) . `` apellaios '' is the month of these rites , and apellon is the `` megistos kb_kouros '' ( the great kb_kouros ) . however kb_it can explain only the kb_dorians kb_type_(biology) of the kb_toponymy , which is connected with the kb_ancient_macedonian_language word `` kb_pella '' ( kb_pella ) , `` stone '' . stones played an important part in the kb_cult_(religious_practice) of the kb_god , especially in the kb_oracular shrine of kb_delphi ( kb_omphalos ) .the `` kb_homeric_hymn '' represents kb_apollo_program as kb_a kb_northern_hemisphere intruder . kb_histidine kb_arrival_(abba_album) must have occurred during the `` kb_greek_dark_ages ages '' that followed the destruction of the kb_mycenaean_civilization , and kb_histidine conflict with kb_gaia ( mother kb_earth ) was represented by the legend of kb_histidine slaying her kb_decay_product the serpent kb_python_(mythology) .the kb_earth kb_deity had kb_power_(physics) over the ghostly kb_world_war_ii , and kb_it is believed that she was the kb_deity behind the kb_oracle . the older tales mentioned kb_2_(number) dragons kb_world_health_organization were perhaps intentionally conflated . kb_a female dragon kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_delphyne ( ; kb_cf. . , `` kb_womb '' ) , and kb_a kb_male serpent kb_typhon ( ; from , `` to smoke '' ) , the adversary of kb_zeus in the kb_titanomachy , kb_world_health_organization the narrators confused with kb_python_(mythology) . kb_python_(mythology) was the good kb_daemon_(classical_mythology) ( ἀγαθὸς δαίμων ) of the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina as kb_it appears in kb_minoan_civilization kb_religion , but she was represented as kb_a dragon , as often happens in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_european_folklore as kb_water_well as in the kb_east_africa .kb_apollo_program and kb_histidine sister kb_artemis can bring kb_death with their arrows . the kb_human_fertilization that diseases and kb_death come from invisible kb_shot_(filmmaking) sent by kb_supernatural beings , or magicians is common in kb_germanic_languages and kb_norse_mythology kb_mythology . in kb_greek_mythology kb_artemis was the kb_leader ( , `` kb_hegemon '' ) of the kb_nymphs , kb_world_health_organization had similar functions with the kb_norse_mythology kb_elf . the `` elf-shot '' originally indicated kb_disease or kb_death attributed to the kb_elf , but kb_it was later attested denoting stone arrow-heads which were used by witches to harm kb_people_(american_magazine) , and also for kb_healing rituals .the kb_vedas kb_rudra has some similar functions with kb_apollo_program . the terrible kb_god is called `` the kb_archery '' , and the kb_bow_river is also an attribute of kb_shiva . kb_rudra could bring diseases with kb_histidine arrows , but kb_he_(letter) was able to free kb_people_(american_magazine) of them , and kb_histidine alternative kb_shiva is kb_a healer kb_physician kb_god . however the kb_indo-european_languageskb_it seems an kb_oracular kb_cult_(religious_practice) existed in kb_delphi from the kb_mycenaean_greece age . in historical times , the kb_priests of kb_delphi were called kb_labëria ( kb_alkyl ) yadai , `` the double-axe men '' , which indicates kb_minoan_civilization kb_evolution . the double-axe , kb_labrys , was the holy kb_symbol of the kb_crete kb_labyrinth . the kb_homeric_hymn adds that kb_apollo_program appeared as kb_a kb_dolphin and carried kb_crete kb_priests to kb_delphi , where they evidently transferred their kb_religion practices . `` kb_apollo_program delphinios '' or `` delphidios '' was kb_a sea-god especially worshiped in kb_crete and in the kb_islands_(regional_unit) . kb_apollo_program 's sister kb_artemis , kb_world_health_organization was the kb_ancient_greek kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of hunting , is kb_interpretatio_graeca with kb_britomartis ( kb_diktynna ) , the kb_minoan_civilization `` mistress of the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing '' . in her kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century depictions she is accompanied by the `` mister of the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing '' , kb_a kb_male kb_god of hunting kb_world_health_organization had the kb_bow_river as kb_histidine attribute . kb_histidine original kb_toponymy is unknown , but kb_it seems that kb_he_(letter) was absorbed by the more popular kb_apollo_program , kb_world_health_organization stood by the virgin `` mistress of the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing '' , becoming her brother .the kb_old_testament kb_oracle_machine in kb_delphi seem to kb_beryllium connected with kb_a local kb_tradition of the kb_priesthood , and there is not clear kb_evidence_(law) that kb_a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina . this kb_light-emitting_diode some scholars to the kb_eschatocol that kb_pythia carried on the rituals in kb_a kb_consistent procedure through many kb_century_(cricket) , according to the local kb_tradition . in that regard , the mythical seeress kb_sibyl of kb_sultanate_of_rum kb_evolution , with her ecstatic kb_art , looks unrelated to the kb_oracle itself . however , the kb_ancient_greek_astronomy is referring to the kb_existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves , which seem to kb_beryllium kb_confirmation by recent studies .kb_plato describes the priestesses of kb_delphi and kb_dodona as frenzied women , obsessed by `` kb_mania '' ( , `` kb_frenzy '' ) , kb_a kb_ancient_greek word kb_he_(letter) connected with `` mantis '' ( , `` kb_prophet '' ) . frenzied women like sibyls from whose lips the kb_god speaks are recorded in the kb_near_east kb_east_africa as kb_mari,_syria in the kb_2nd_millennium_bc bc . although kb_crete had contacts with kb_mari,_syria from 2000 bc , there is no kb_evidence_(law) that the ecstatic prophetic kb_art existed during the kb_minoan_civilization and kb_mycenaean_greece ages . kb_it is more probable that this kb_art was introduced later from kb_anatoliakb_a non-greek kb_evolution of kb_apollo_program has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) been assumed in scholarship . the kb_toponymy of kb_apollo_program 's mother kb_leto has kb_lydian_language kb_evolution , and she was worshipped on the coasts of kb_anatolia . the inspiration kb_oracular kb_cult_(religious_practice) was probably introduced into kb_greece from kb_anatolia , which is the kb_evolution of kb_sibyl , and where existed some of the oldest kb_oracular shrines . omens , kb_symbols , purifications , and exorcisms appear in kb_old_testament assyro-babylonian kb_literature , and these rituals were kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) into the kb_roman_empire of the kb_hittites . in kb_a kb_hittites text is mentioned that the kb_king invited kb_a babylonian priestess for kb_a certain `` purification '' .kb_a similar story is mentioned by kb_plutarch . kb_he_(letter) writes that the kb_crete kb_prophet kb_epimenides purified kb_athens after the pollution brought by the kb_alcmeonidae , and that the kb_prophet 's expertise in sacrifices and kb_reform_judaism of funeral practices were of great help to kb_solon in kb_histidine kb_reform_judaism of the kb_athenian kb_state_of_matter . the story indicates that kb_epimenides was probably heir to the kb_shamanism#asia religions of kb_asia_(roman_province) , and proves , together with the kb_homeric_hymn , that kb_crete had kb_a resisting kb_religion up to historical times . kb_it seems that these rituals were dormant in kb_greece , and they were reinforced when the kb_greeks migrated to kb_anatolia .kb_homer pictures kb_apollo_program on the side of the kb_troy , fighting against the kb_achaeans_(homer) , during the kb_trojan_war . kb_he_(letter) is pictured as kb_a terrible kb_god , less trusted by the kb_greeks than kb_other_(philosophy) kb_deity . the kb_god seems to kb_beryllium related to `` appaliunas '' , kb_a tutelary kb_god of kb_wilusa ( kb_troy ) in kb_anatolia , but kb_the_word_(free_love) word is not complete . the stones found in front of the gates of kb_homeric kb_troy were the kb_symbols of kb_apollo_program . kb_a kb_western_esotericism kb_sultanate_of_rum kb_evolution may also kb_beryllium bolstered by references to the parallel kb_achilles#worship of `` artimus '' ( kb_artemis ) and `` qλdãns '' , whose kb_toponymy may kb_beryllium kb_cognate with the kb_hittites and kb_dorians kb_theory_of_forms , in surviving kb_lydian_language kb_literature '' . '' however , recent scholars have kb_casting_(metalworking) doubt on the identification of `` qλdãns '' with kb_apollo_program .the kb_greeks gave to him the kb_toponymy `` kb_agyieus '' as the protector kb_god of kb_state_school places and houses kb_world_health_organization wards off kb_evil , and kb_histidine kb_symbol was kb_a tapered stone or kb_column_of_antoninus_pius . however , while usually kb_ancient_greek festivals were celebrated at the kb_full_moon kb_moon , all the feasts of kb_apollo_program were celebrated at the seventh day of the month , and the kb_emphasis_(typography) given to that day ( `` sibutu '' ) indicates kb_a babylonian kb_evolution .the kb_bronze_age#age_sub-divisions kb_bronze_age ( from 1700 to 1200 bce ) kb_hittites and kb_hurrian `` kb_aplu_(deity) '' was kb_a kb_god of kb_plague_(disease) , invoked during kb_plague_(disease) years . here we have an kb_apotropaic_magic situation , where kb_a kb_god originally bringing kb_the_plague kb_plague_(disease) was invoked to end kb_it . kb_aplu_(deity) , kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` the son of '' , was kb_a kb_title given to the kb_god kb_nergal , kb_world_health_organization was linked to the babylonian kb_solar_deity the kb_sun kb_shamash . kb_homer interprets kb_apollo_program as kb_a terrible kb_god ( ) kb_world_health_organization brings kb_death and kb_disease with kb_histidine arrows , but kb_world_health_organization can also heal , possessing kb_a kb_magic_(supernatural) kb_art that separates him from the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_ancient_greek kb_deity . in `` kb_iliad '' , kb_histidine kb_priest prays to `` kb_apollo_smintheus '' , the kb_mouse kb_god kb_world_health_organization retains an older kb_agriculture kb_function_(biology) as the protector from field rats . all these functions , including the kb_function_(biology) of the healer-god kb_paeanunusually among the kb_summer_olympics kb_deities , kb_apollo_program had kb_2_(number) kb_cult_(religious_practice) sites that had widespread influence : kb_delos and kb_delphi . in kb_cult_(religious_practice) practice , kb_delos kb_apollo_program and kb_pythian_apollo kb_apollo_program ( the kb_apollo_program of kb_delphi ) were kb_sulfate distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality . kb_apollo_program 's kb_cult_(religious_practice) was already fully established when written sources commenced , about 650 bce . kb_apollo_program became extremely important to the kb_ancient_greek kb_world_war_ii as an kb_oracular kb_deity in the kb_archaic_greece period , and the kb_frequency of kb_theophoric_names names such as `` apollodorus '' or `` apollonios '' and cities kb_english_alphabet#letter_names `` kb_sozopol '' testify to kb_histidine popularity . kb_oracular sanctuaries to kb_apollo_program were established in kb_other_(philosophy) sites . in the 2nd and 3rd century kb_council_of_europe , those at kb_didyma and kb_clarus pronounced the so-called `` theological kb_oracle_machine '' , in which kb_apollo_program confirms that all kb_deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing , highest kb_deity . `` in the 3rd century , kb_apollo_program fell silent . kb_julian_the_apostate apostatekb_apollo_program had kb_a famous kb_oracle in kb_delphi , and kb_other_(philosophy) notable ones in kb_clarus and kb_branchidae . kb_histidine kb_oracular shrine in kb_abae in kb_phocis , where kb_he_(letter) bore the toponymic kb_epithet `` kb_abaeus '' ( , `` kb_apollon_smyrni_f.c. abaios '' ) , was important enough to kb_beryllium consulted by kb_croesus .kb_histidine kb_oracular shrines include :kb_oracle_machine were also given by sons of kb_apollo_program .many kb_egyptian_temple were dedicated to kb_apollo_program in kb_greece and the kb_greek_colonies . they show the kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) of the kb_cult_(religious_practice) of kb_apollo_program and the kb_evolution of the kb_ancient_greek kb_architecture , which was mostly based on the rightness of kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism and on mathematical kb_foreign_relations_of_albania . some of the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century kb_egyptian_temple , especially in kb_crete , do not belong to any kb_ancient_greek kb_order_(biology) . kb_it seems that the kb_first_trimester peripteral kb_egyptian_temple were rectangular wooden kb_structural_analysis . the different wooden kb_chemical_element were considered kb_divinity , and their kb_theory_of_forms were preserved in the kb_marble or stone kb_chemical_element of the kb_egyptian_temple of kb_doric_order . the kb_greeks used standard types because they believed that the kb_world_war_ii of kb_object_relations_theory was kb_a series of typical kb_theory_of_forms which could kb_beryllium represented in several instances . the kb_egyptian_temple should kb_beryllium canonic , and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection . from the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century times there were certain kb_biological_rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle kb_buildings . the kb_first_trimester kb_buildings were built narrowly in kb_order_(biology) to hold the roof , and when the kb_dimensional_analysis changed some mathematical kb_foreign_relations_of_albania became necessary in kb_order_(biology) to keep the original kb_theory_of_forms . this probably influenced the kb_theory of kb_grammatical_number of kb_pythagoras , kb_world_health_organization believed that behind the kb_appearance_(philosophy) of things there was the permanent kb_principle_(chemistry) of kb_mathematics .the kb_doric_order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century bc but there was kb_a mathematical problem regarding the kb_positional_notation of the triglyphs , which could n't kb_beryllium solved without changing the original kb_theory_of_forms . the kb_order_(biology) was almost abandoned for the kb_ionic_order , but the kb_ionic_crystal kb_list_of_australian_capital_cities also posed an kb_insoluble problem at the corner of kb_a kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina . both kb_order_(biology) were abandoned for the kb_corinthian_order kb_order_(biology)when kb_zeus ' wife kb_hera discovered that kb_leto was impregnanted by kb_zeus , she banned kb_leto from giving birth on `` kb_solid_earth '' . in her wanderings , kb_leto sought shelter on many lands , only to kb_beryllium rejected by them . finally , she saw kb_delos , kb_a floating kb_island , which was neither kb_a real kb_island nor kb_a mainland . kb_it is said that kb_apollo_program , still in kb_leto 's kb_womb , had informed kb_histidine mother about kb_delos to put an end to her suffering . kb_leto , when welcomed by kb_delos , gave birth there , clinging to kb_a kb_palm_tree .kb_it is also stated that kb_hera kidnapped kb_eileithyiawhen kb_apollo_program was born clutching kb_a kb_golden_eagle kb_sword , the swans circled kb_delos seven times and the kb_nymphs sang in delight . soon after kb_he_(letter) was born , kb_he_(letter) was washed clean by the goddesses and was covered in kb_white_american garment , with kb_golden_eagle bands fastened around him . since kb_leto was unable to kb_animal_feed the kb_new_world born , kb_themis , the kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of kb_divinity kb_law , fed him the kb_nectar_(plant) , or kb_ragweed . upon tasting the kb_divinity kb_food_industry , kb_apollo_program broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that kb_he_(letter) would kb_beryllium the kb_master's_degree of kb_lyrekb_leto was kb_acceptance#self_acceptance by the kb_people_(american_magazine) of kb_delos and she promised them that her son would kb_beryllium always favorable towards kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey . afterwards , kb_zeus secured kb_delos to the bottom of the kb_oceanus . this kb_island later became kb_sacred_architecture to kb_apollo_program .kb_apollo_program was born on the seventh day ( , `` hebdomagenes '' ) of the month kb_thargelion —according to delian tradition—or of the month bysios—according to delphian kb_tradition . the seventh and twentieth , the days of the kb_new_world and kb_full_moon kb_moon , were ever afterwards held kb_sacred_architecture to him . mythographers agree that kb_artemis was born kb_first_trimester and subsequently assisted with the birth of kb_apollo_program , or that kb_artemis was born on the kb_island of kb_ortygia and that she helped kb_leto cross the kb_sea_(astronomy) to kb_delos the kb_next day to give birth to kb_apollo_program .as kb_a child , kb_apollo_program is said to have built kb_a kb_foundation_(engineering) and an altar on kb_delos using the horns of the goats that kb_histidine sister kb_artemis hunted . since kb_he_(letter) learnt the kb_art of building when

kb_tartarus as kb_a kb_punishment . however , kb_zeus did n't agree and instead exiled kb_histidine son from kb_mount_olympus , and instructed him to get purified . kb_apollo_program had to serve as kb_a slave for nine years . after the servitude was over , as per kb_histidine kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) 's kb_order_(biology) kb_apollo_program travelled to the kb_vale_of_tempe of tempe to kb_bath,_somerset in waters of kb_pineios_(thessaly) . there kb_zeus himself performed purification rites on kb_apollo_program . purified , kb_apollo_program was escorted by kb_histidine half sister kb_athena to kb_delphi where the kb_oracular shrine was finally handed over to him by kb_gaea . according to kb_a variation , kb_apollo_program had also travelled to kb_crete , where

kb_hecate 's kb_achilles#worship is at kb_apollo_program 's kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina in kb_miletos . there , kb_hecate was taken to kb_beryllium kb_apollo_program 's sister counterpart in the absence of kb_artemis . kb_hecate 's kb_moon kb_nature makes her the kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of the waning kb_moon and contrats and complements , at the same kb_time_(magazine) , kb_apollo_program 's solar kb_nature .as kb_a kb_deity of kb_knowledge_representation and kb_great_power kb_power_(physics) , kb_apollo_program was seen kb_being the kb_male counterpart of kb_athena . kb_being kb_zeus ' favorite children , they were given more powers and duties . kb_apollo_program and kb_athena often took up the role as protectors of cities , and were patrons of some of the important cities . kb_athena was the kb_principle_(chemistry) kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of kb_athens , kb_apollo_program was the kb_principle_(chemistry) kb_god of kb_spartaas patrons of kb_arts , kb_apollo_program and kb_athena were companions of the kb_muses , the former kb_a much more frequent companion than the latter . kb_apollo_program was sometimes called the son of kb_athena and kb_hephaestus due to kb_histidine wise and artistic kb_nature .in the kb_trojan_war , as kb_zeus ' kb_executive_(government) , kb_apollo_program is seen holding the kb_aegis like kb_athena usually does . kb_apollo_program 's decisions were usually approved by kb_histidine sister kb_athena , and they both worked to establish kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law and kb_order_(biology) kb_set_(mythology) forth by kb_zeus .in kb_aeschylus ' `` kb_oresteia '' trilogy , kb_clytemnestra kills her husband , kb_king kb_agamemnon because kb_he_(letter) had sacrificed their kb_decay_product kb_iphigenia to proceed forward with the kb_trojan_war . kb_apollo_program gives an kb_order_(biology) through the kb_oracle at kb_delphi that kb_agamemnon 's son , kb_orestes , is to kill kb_clytemnestra and kb_aegisthus , her lover . kb_orestes and pylades carry out the revenge , and consequently kb_orestes is pursued by the kb_erinyes or furies ( female kb_anthropomorphism of kb_revenge ) .kb_apollo_program and the furies argue about whether the kb_matricide was justified ; kb_apollo_program holds that the kb_chemical_bond of kb_marriage is kb_sacred_architecture and kb_orestes was avenging kb_histidine kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , whereas the kb_erinyes say that the kb_chemical_bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the kb_chemical_bond of kb_marriage . they invade kb_histidine kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina , and kb_he_(letter) drives them away . kb_he_(letter) says that the kb_matter should kb_beryllium brought before kb_athena . kb_apollo_program promises to protect kb_orestes , as kb_orestes has become kb_apollo_program 's kb_supplication . kb_apollo_program advocates kb_orestes at kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial , and ultimately kb_athena kb_biological_rules in favor of kb_apollo_program .the kb_roman_empire kb_achilles#worship of kb_apollo_program was kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome from the kb_greeks . as kb_a quintessentially kb_list_of_greek_mythological_figures , kb_apollo_program had no direct kb_roman_empire kb_cognate , although later kb_roman_empire poets often referred to him as phoebus . there was kb_a kb_tradition that the kb_pythia kb_oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kb_roman_kingdom kb_roman_empire during the reign of kb_tarquinius_superbus superbus .on the occasion of kb_a pestilence in the 430s bce , kb_apollo_program 's kb_temple_of_apollo_sosianus at kb_roman_empire was established in the flaminian fields , replacing an older kb_cult_(religious_practice) site there known as the `` apollinare '' . during the kb_second_punic_war kb_war in 212 bce , the `` kb_ludi_apollinares apollinares '' ( `` apollonian games '' ) were instituted in kb_histidine honor , on the instructions of kb_a kb_prophecy attributed to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) marcius . in the kb_time_(magazine) of kb_augustus , kb_world_health_organization considered himself under the special protection of kb_apollo_program and was even said to kb_beryllium kb_histidine son , kb_histidine kb_achilles#worship kb_adaptation and kb_he_(letter) became kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_tribal_chief kb_deity of kb_roman_empire .after the kb_battle_of_actium kb_actium , which was fought near kb_a sanctuary of kb_apollo_program , kb_augustus enlarged kb_apollo_program 's kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina , dedicated kb_a portion of the spoils to him , and instituted kb_quinquennial games in kb_histidine kb_honour . kb_he_(letter) also erected kb_temple_of_apollo_(palatine) kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina to the kb_god on the kb_palatine_hill kb_hill . sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to kb_apollo_program and kb_diana_(mythology) formed the culmination of the kb_secular_games , held in 17 bce to celebrate the dawn of kb_a kb_new_world era .the kb_tribal_chief apollonian festival was the kb_pythian_games games held every four years at kb_delphi and was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the four great kb_panhellenic_games games . also of kb_major_(united_states) importance was the kb_delia_(festival) held every four years on kb_delos .kb_athenian kb_annual_plant festivals included the kb_boedromia , kb_metageitnia , kb_pyanepsia , and kb_thargelia .spartan kb_annual_plant festivals were the kb_carneia and the kb_hyacinthia .kb_thebes_(greece) every nine years held the kb_daphnephoria .kb_apollo_program 's most common kb_attribute_(role-playing_games) were the kb_bow_river and kb_arrow_(weapon) . kb_other_(philosophy) kb_attribute_(role-playing_games) of kb_histidine included the kb_kithara ( an advanced version of the common kb_lyre ) , the kb_plectrum and the kb_sword . another common emblem was the kb_sacrificial_tripod tripod , representing kb_histidine prophetic powers . the kb_pythian_games games were held in kb_apollo_program 's honor every four years at kb_delphi . the kb_bay_laurel kb_bay_laurel kb_plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the kb_laurel_wreath of victorythe kb_palm_tree was also kb_sacred_architecture to kb_apollo_program because kb_he_(letter) had been born under kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) in kb_delos . kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing kb_sacred_architecture to kb_apollo_program included kb_gray_wolf , dolphins , kb_roe_deer kb_deer , swans , cicadas ( symbolizing kb_music and song ) , hawks , ravens , crows , kb_snakes ( referencing kb_apollo_program 's kb_function_(biology) as the kb_god of kb_prophecy ) , mice and griffinsas kb_god of colonization , kb_apollo_program gave kb_oracular guidance on kb_abraham_lincoln_on_slavery#colonization , especially during the height of colonization , 750–550 bce . according to kb_ancient_greek_astronomy , kb_he_(letter) helped kb_crete or arcadian kb_colonies_in_antiquity found kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_troy . however , this story may reflect kb_a kb_cultural_anthropology influence which had the kb_obverse_and_reverse direction : kb_hittites kb_cuneiform kb_literature mention kb_a minor kb_asian_people kb_god called `` appaliunas '' or `` apalunas '' in connection with kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_wilusa attested in kb_hittites kb_inscriptiones_graecae , which is now generally regarded as kb_being kb_identical_particles with the kb_ancient_greek kb_troy by most scholars . in this kb_interpretation_(logic) , kb_apollo_program 's kb_title of `` lykegenes '' can simply kb_beryllium kb_walter_read as `` born in kb_lycia '' , which effectively severs the kb_god 's supposed link with kb_gray_wolf ( possibly kb_a kb_folk_etymology ) .in literary contexts , kb_apollo_program represents kb_harmony , kb_order_(biology) , and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of kb_dionysus , kb_god of kb_wine , kb_world_health_organization represents ecstasy and disorder . the kb_contrast_(vision) between the roles of these kb_deity is reflected in the adjectives kb_apollonian_and_dionysian and dionysian . however , the kb_greeks thought of the kb_2_(number) qualities as complementary : the kb_2_(number) kb_deity are kb_monk , and when kb_apollo_program at kb_winter kb_left-wing_politics for kb_hyperborea , kb_he_(letter) would leave the kb_pythia kb_oracle to kb_dionysus . this kb_contrast_(vision) appears to kb_beryllium shown on the kb_2_(number) sides of the kb_borghese_vase vase .kb_apollo_program is often associated with the kb_golden_mean_(philosophy) . this is the kb_ancient_greek kb_ideal_(ring_theory) of kb_moderation and kb_a kb_virtue that opposes kb_gluttonykb_apollo_program is kb_a common kb_theme_(byzantine_district) in kb_ancient_greek and kb_roman_empire kb_art and also in the kb_art of the kb_renaissance . the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century kb_ancient_greek word for kb_a kb_statue is `` delight '' ( , `` agalma '' ) , and the sculptors tried to create kb_theory_of_forms which would inspire such guiding kb_computer_vision . kb_ancient_greek kb_art puts into kb_apollo_program the highest kb_degree_(angle) of kb_power_(physics) and kb_beauty that can kb_beryllium imagined . the sculptors kb_derived_trait this from kb_observations_(pierre_belon) on kb_human_kind , but they also kb_embodied_agent in kb_concrete kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , issues beyond the reach of kb_ordinary_(officer) thought .the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the kb_cult_(religious_practice) of the kb_human_body that was essentially kb_a kb_religion activity . the muscular frames and kb_limb_(anatomy) combined with slim waists indicate the kb_ancient_greek desire for health , and the kb_health capacity which was necessary in the hard kb_ancient_greek environment . the statues of kb_apollo_program embody kb_beauty , kb_formal_balance and inspire awe before the kb_beauty of the kb_world_war_ii .the kb_evolution of the kb_ancient_greek kb_sculpture can kb_beryllium observed in kb_histidine depictions from the almost static formal kb_kouros kb_type_(biology) in kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period , to the kb_representation_(arts) of kb_motion_(physics) in kb_a relative harmonious whole in kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period . in kb_classical_greece the kb_emphasis_(typography) is not given to the illusive kb_imagination kb_reality represented by the kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_theory_of_forms , but to the analogies and the kb_interaction of the members in the whole , kb_a method created by kb_polykleitos . finally kb_praxiteles seems to kb_beryllium released from any kb_art and kb_religion conformities , and kb_histidine masterpieces are kb_a kb_mixture of kb_realism_(arts) with stylization .the kb_evolution of the kb_ancient_greek kb_art seems to kb_go_(game) parallel with the kb_ancient_greek kb_philosophy conceptions , which changed from the natural-philosophy of kb_thales to the kb_metaphysics kb_theory of kb_pythagoras . kb_thales searched for kb_a kb_simple_polygon material-form directly perceptible by the senses , behind the appearances of things , and kb_histidine kb_theory is also related to the older kb_animism . this was paralleled in kb_sculpture by the kb_absolute_morality kb_representation_(arts) of vigorous kb_life_(magazine) , through unnaturally simplified kb_theory_of_forms .kb_pythagoras believed that behind the kb_appearance_(philosophy) of things , there was the permanent kb_principle_(chemistry) of kb_mathematics , and that the kb_theory_of_forms were based on kb_a kb_transcendental_number mathematical relation . the kb_theory_of_forms on kb_earth , are imperfect imitations ( , `` eikones '' , `` images '' ) of the celestial kb_world_war_ii of kb_grammatical_number . kb_histidine kb_idea had kb_a great influence on post-archaic kb_art . the kb_ancient_greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation , that would kb_lead to the esthetic perfection . ( kb_aesthetic_canon ) .in kb_classical_greece , kb_anaxagoras asserted that kb_a kb_divinity kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving ( kb_mind ) gave kb_order_(biology) to the seeds of the kb_universe , and kb_platokb_kouros ( `` kb_male youth '' ) is the kb_modern_history kb_terminology given to those representations of standing kb_male youths which kb_first_trimester appear in the kb_archaic_period_in_greece in kb_greece . this kb_type_(biology) served certain kb_religion needs and was kb_first_trimester kb_anatolian_hypothesis for what was previously thought to kb_beryllium depictions of `` kb_apollo_program '' . the kb_first_trimester statues are certainly still and formal . the formality of their stance seems to kb_beryllium related with the kb_egyptian_language kb_stare_decisis , but kb_it was kb_acceptance#self_acceptance for kb_a good kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving . the sculptors had kb_a clear idea of what kb_a kb_thomas_young_(scientist) man is , and kb_embodied_agent the archaic smile of good manners , the firm and springy step , the kb_formal_balance of the kb_human_body , dignity , and youthful kb_happiness . when they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men , kb_it was because men had common kb_semitic_root with the unchanging kb_deity . the adoption of kb_a standard recognizable kb_type_(biology) for kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_time_(magazine) , is probably because kb_nature gives preference in survival of kb_a kb_type_(biology) which has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_beryllium kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by the kb_climatic conditions , and also due to the kb_general_(united_states) kb_ancient_greek belief that kb_nature expresses itself in `` kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_theory_of_forms '' that can kb_beryllium imagined and represented . these kb_theory_of_forms expressed immortality . kb_apollo_program was the kb_immortality kb_god of `` kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_formal_balance and kb_order_(biology) '' . kb_histidine shrine in kb_delphiin the kb_first_trimester large-scale depictions during the kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period ( 640–580 bc ) , the artists tried to draw kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's attention to kb_look_(american_magazine) into the interior of the face and the kb_human_body which were not represented as lifeless masses , but as kb_being full of kb_life_(magazine) . the kb_greeks maintained , until late in their kb_civilization_(series) , an almost kb_animism idea that the statues are in some kb_word_sense alive . this embodies the belief that the image was somehow the kb_god or man himself . kb_a kb_fine_(penalty) example is the kb_statue of the `` kb_sacred_gate kb_kouros '' which was found at the cemetery of kb_dipylon in kb_athens ( kb_dipylon_kouros ) . the kb_statue is the `` kb_object_(philosophy) kb_thing-in-itself itself '' , and kb_histidine slender face with the deep eyes express an kb_intellectual kb_eternity . according to the kb_ancient_greek_astronomy the kb_dipylon was kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_daedalusthe kb_animism idea as the kb_representation_(arts) of the kb_imagination kb_reality , is sanctified in the kb_homeric poems and in kb_ancient_greek kb_egyptian_mythology , in stories of the kb_god kb_hephaestus ( kb_phaistos ) and the mythic kb_daedalus ( the builder of the kb_labyrinth ) that made images which moved of their own accord . this kind of kb_art goes back to the kb_minoan_civilization period , when its main kb_theme_(byzantine_district) was the kb_representation_(arts) of kb_motion_(physics) in kb_a specific moment . these free-standing statues were usually kb_marble , but also the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism rendered in kb_limestone , kb_bronze_age , kb_ivory and kb_terracotta .the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century examples of life-sized statues of kb_apollo_program , may kb_beryllium kb_2_(number) figures from the kb_ionic_crystal sanctuary on the kb_island of kb_delos . such statues were found across the kb_ancient_greek speaking kb_world_war_ii , the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of kb_apollo_program with more than kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hundred from the sanctuary of `` kb_apollo_program ptoios '' , kb_boeotia alone . the last stage in the development of the `` kb_kouros kb_type_(biology) '' is the kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period ( 520–485 bc ) , in which the kb_ancient_greek kb_sculpture attained kb_a full kb_knowledge_representation of kb_human_body and used to create kb_a relative harmonious whole . ranking from the very few bronzes survived to kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) is the masterpiece kb_bronze_age kb_piraeus_apollo . kb_it was found in kb_piraeus , the kb_harbour of kb_athens . the kb_statue originally held the kb_bow_river in its kb_left-wing_politics kb_hand , and kb_a cup of pouring libation in its kb_right-wing_politics kb_hand . kb_it probably comes from north-eastern kb_peloponnesus . the kb_emphasis_(typography) is given in kb_comparative_anatomy , and kb_it is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester attempts to represent kb_a kind of kb_motion_(physics) , and kb_beauty relative to proportions , which appear mostly in post-archaic kb_art . the kb_statue kb_throw_(grappling) some kb_light on an artistic centre which , with an independently kb_adaptation harder , simpler and heavier kb_carpel , restricts kb_ionian_greeks influence in kb_athens . finally , this is the germ from which the kb_art of kb_polykleitosat kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the kb_classical_greece , kb_it was considered that kb_beauty in visible things as in everything else , consisted of kb_symmetry and proportions . the artists tried also to represent kb_motion_(physics) in kb_a specific moment ( kb_myron ) , which may kb_beryllium considered as the reappearance of the dormant kb_minoan_civilization kb_chemical_element . kb_comparative_anatomy and kb_geometry are fused in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) , and each does something to the kb_other_(philosophy) . the kb_ancient_greek sculptors tried to clarify kb_it by looking for mathematical proportions , just as they sought some kb_reality behind appearances . kb_polykleitos in kb_histidine `` kb_aesthetic_canon '' wrote that kb_beauty consists in the kb_hierarchical_proportion not of the kb_chemical_element ( materials ) , but of the parts , that is the interrelation of parts with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) another and with the whole . kb_it seems that kb_he_(letter) was influenced by the kb_theories of kb_pythagoras .the famous `` kb_apollo_program of kb_mantua '' and its variants are early kb_theory_of_forms of the kb_apollo_citharoedus kb_statue kb_type_(biology) , in which the kb_god holds the kb_cithara in kb_histidine kb_left-wing_politics kb_arm . the kb_type_(biology) is represented by kb_neo-attic kb_ottoman_empire kb_roman_empire copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century , modelled upon kb_a supposed kb_ancient_greek kb_bronze_age original made in the kb_second_language quarter of the 5th century bce , in kb_a kb_carpel similar to works of kb_polykleitos but more archaic . the kb_apollo_program held the `` cythara '' against kb_histidine extended kb_left-wing_politics kb_arm , of which in the louvre example , kb_a fragment of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) twisting scrolling kb_french_horn upright remains against kb_histidine biceps .though the proportions were always important in kb_ancient_greek kb_art , the kb_appeal of the kb_ancient_greek sculptures eludes any explanation by kb_hierarchical_proportion alone . the statues of kb_apollo_program were thought to kb_incarnation kb_histidine living presence , and these representations of illusive kb_imagination kb_reality had deep kb_semitic_root in the kb_minoan_civilization period , and in the kb_orthodoxy of the kb_first_trimester kb_ancient_greekin the archaic pediments and friezes of the kb_egyptian_temple , the artists had kb_a problem to fit kb_a kb_group_(periodic_table) of figures into an isosceles kb_triangle_(musical_instrument) with acute angles at the kb_base_(chemistry) .the kb_siphnian_treasury treasury in kb_delphi was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester kb_ancient_greek kb_buildings utilizing the kb_solid_solution to put the dominating kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism in the middle , and to complete the descending scale of height with kb_other_(philosophy) figures sitting or kneeling . the pediment shows the story of kb_heracles stealing kb_apollo_program 's tripod that was strongly associated with kb_histidine kb_oracular inspiration . their kb_2_(number) figures hold the centre . in the pediment of the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina of kb_zeus in kb_olympia_(manet)these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the kb_human_eye for their own visible sake . they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in kb_space , but only as parts in kb_a larger whole . while each scene has its own kb_character_(computing) and completeness kb_it must fit into the kb_general_(united_states) sequence to which kb_it belongs . in these archaic pediments the sculptors use kb_empty_string intervals , to suggest kb_a passage to and from kb_a busy battlefield . the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical kb_pattern and kb_order_(biology) , and this was improved when kb_classical_conditioning kb_art brought kb_a greater kb_freedom and kb_economy_of_alaska .kb_apollo_program as kb_a handsome beardless kb_thomas_young_(scientist) man , is often depicted with kb_a kb_kithara ( as kb_apollo_citharoedus ) or kb_bow_river in kb_histidine kb_hand , or reclining on kb_a kb_tree ( the kb_apollo_lykeios and kb_apollo_sauroctonos types ) . the kb_apollo_belvedere is kb_a kb_marble kb_sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century ; for kb_century_(cricket) kb_it epitomized the ideals of kb_classical_antiquity for europeans , from the kb_renaissance through the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century . the kb_marble is kb_a kb_hellenistic_period or kb_roman_empire copy of kb_a kb_bronze_age original by the kb_ancient_greek kb_sculptor_(constellation) kb_leochares , made between 350 and 325 bce .the life-size so-called `` kb_adonis '' found in 1780 on the site of kb_a `` kb_roman_villa '' near the via labicana in the kb_roman_empire suburb of centocelle is kb_interpretatio_graeca as an kb_apollo_program by kb_modern_history scholars . in the late 2nd century kb_council_of_europe floor kb_mosaic from kb_el_djem , kb_roman_empire `` thysdrus '' , kb_he_(letter) is identifiable as kb_helios by kb_histidine effulgent kb_halo_(religious_iconography) , though now even kb_a kb_god 's kb_divinity kb_nudity is concealed by kb_histidine cloak , kb_a kb_mark_waugh of increasing conventions of modesty in the later kb_roman_empire .another haloed kb_apollo_program in kb_mosaic , from kb_hadrumentum , is in the kb_museum at kb_sousse . the conventions of this kb_representation_(arts) , kb_human_head tilted , lips slightly parted , large-eyed , curling kb_hairstyle cut in locks kb_grazing the kb_neck , were kb_adaptation in the 3rd century bce to depict kb_alexander_the_great great . some kb_time_(magazine) after this kb_mosaic was kb_execution_(computing) , the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century depictions of kb_jesus_christ would also kb_beryllium beardless and haloed .kb_apollo_program has often featured in postclassical kb_art and kb_ancient_egyptian_literature . kb_percy_bysshe_shelley bysshe shelley composed kb_a `` hymn of kb_apollo_program '' ( 1820 ) , and the kb_god 's instruction of the kb_muses formed the kb_grammatical_subject of kb_igor_stravinsky stravinsky 's `` kb_apollon_musagète '' ( 1927–1928 ) . in 1978 , the kb_canadians band kb_rush_(band) released kb_hemispheres_(rush_album) kb_purple_rain_(album) with songs `` kb_apollo_program : bringer of wisdom '' / '' kb_dionysus : bringer of kb_love '' .in discussion of kb_the_arts kb_arts , kb_a distinction is sometimes made between the kb_apollonian_and_dionysian and dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing kb_intellectual kb_order_(biology) and the latter with chaotic creativity . kb_friedrich_nietzsche nietzsche argued that kb_a fusion of the kb_2_(number) was most desirable . kb_carl_jung jung 's kb_apollo_archetype represents what kb_he_(letter) saw as the disposition in kb_people_(american_magazine) to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional kb_distance .kb_charles_handy handy , in `` kb_deity of kb_management '' ( 1978 ) uses kb_ancient_greek kb_deity as kb_a metaphor to portray various types of kb_organizational_culture kb_albanian_culture . kb_apollo_program represents kb_a 'role ' kb_albanian_culture where kb_order_(biology) ,

to the mid-2000s . generally considered by kb_art_critic and kb_fellow players to kb_beryllium kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the greatest kb_tennis players of all kb_time_(magazine) , agassi has been called the greatest service returner ever to play the game and was described by the kb_bbc upon kb_histidine retirement as `` perhaps the biggest worldwide kb_star in the kb_sport 's kb_history '' . as kb_a result , kb_he_(letter) is credited for helping to revive the popularity of kb_tennis during the 1990s .in singles kb_tennis , agassi is an eight-time kb_grand_slam_(tennis) slam champion

kb_indo-gangetic_plain plain , and were then absorbed by kb_indo-aryan_languages at an early date as kb_indo-aryan_languages kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) kb_east_africa . peterson notes that

kb_lexical_semantics , finds little kb_evidence_(law) for internal branching , though kb_he_(letter) did find an kb_area of increased contact between the kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages , such that languages of all kb_branches_of_science apart from the kb_geography_of_albania distant kb_munda_languages and kb_nicobarese_languages show greater similarity to kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages the closer they are to those kb_branches_of_science , without any noticeable innovations common to kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages .kb_he_(letter) therefore takes the kb_conservative view that the thirteen kb_branches_of_science of austroasiatic should kb_beryllium treated as equidistant on kb_electric_current kb_evidence_(law) . sidwell & kb_roger_blench ( 2011 ) discuss this proposal in more detail , and note that there is good kb_evidence_(law) for kb_a khasi–palaungic kb_cladistics , which could also possibly kb_beryllium closely related to khmuic .if this would the case , sidwell & kb_roger_blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) westward . sidwell & kb_roger_blench ( 2011 ) suggest kb_shompen_language as an additional branch , and kb_believe_(tv_series) that kb_a vieto-katuic connection is worth investigating . in kb_general_(united_states) , however , the kb_family_(biology) is thought to have diversified too quickly for kb_a deeply nested kb_structure to have kb_adaptation , since proto-austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the kb_central_europe kb_mekong_river kb_valley relatively quickly .subsequently , sidwell ( 2015a : 179 ) kb_anatolian_hypothesis that kb_nicobarese_languages subgroups with kb_aslian_languages , just as how khasian and palaungic subgroup with each kb_other_(philosophy) . kb_a subsequent computational kb_phylogenetics kb_analysis of the austroasiatic kb_language_family by sidwell ( 2015b ) suggests that austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science may have kb_a loosely nested kb_structure rather than kb_a completely rake-like kb_structure , with an east-west kb_division_(mathematics) ( consisting of kb_munda_languages , khasic , palaungic , and khmuic forming kb_a kb_western_esotericism kb_group_(periodic_table) as opposed to all of the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_branches_of_science ) occurring possibly as early as 7,000 years before present .integrating computational kb_phylogenetics kb_linguistics with recent kb_archaeology findings , kb_paul_sidwell ( 2015c ) further expanded kb_histidine kb_mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into kb_indochina from the kb_lingnan kb_area of kb_south_china , with the subsequent kb_mekong riverine dispersal taking kb_place_of_articulation after the initial kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_neolithic farmers from kb_south_china .sidwell ( 2015c ) tentatively suggests that austroasiatic may have begun to split up 5,000 years b.p . during the kb_neolithic_transition era of kb_mainland_southeast_asia kb_southeast_asia , with all the kb_major_(united_states) kb_branches_of_science of austroasiatic formed by 4,000 b.p . austroasiatic would have had kb_2_(number) possible dispersal routes from the kb_western_esotericism kb_peripheral_nervous_system of the kb_pearl_river_(china) kb_river kb_drainage_divide of kb_lingnan , which would have been either kb_a kb_coastal route down the kb_coast of kb_vietnam , or downstream through the kb_mekong_river via kb_yunnan . both the reconstructed kb_lexicon of proto-austroasiatic and the kb_archaeology record clearly show that early austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers around 4,000 b.p . cultivated kb_rice and kb_millet , kept kb_livestock such as dogs , pigs , and kb_chickens , and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than kb_coastal environments .at 4,500 b.p. , this `` kb_neolithic package '' suddenly arrived in kb_indochina from the kb_lingnan kb_area without kb_cereal kb_cereal and displaced the kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet pre-neolithic kb_hunter-gatherer cultures , with kb_cereal husks found in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_indochina by 4,100 b.p . and in kb_southern_europe kb_indochina by 3,800 b.p . however , sidwell ( 2015c ) found that kb_iron is not reconstructable in proto-austroasiatic , since each austroasiatic branch has different terms for kb_iron that had been kb_loanword relatively lately from tai , kb_chinese_characters , tibetan , kb_malay_language , and kb_other_(philosophy) languages .during the kb_iron_age about 2,500 b.p. , relatively kb_thomas_young_(scientist) austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science in kb_indochina such as kb_vietic_languages , kb_katuic_languages , kb_pearic_languages , and kb_khmer_alphabet were formed , while the more internally diverse kb_bahnaric_languages branch ( dating to about 3,000 b.p . ) underwent more extensive internal diversification . by the kb_iron_age , all of the austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science were more or less in their present-day locations , with most of the diversification within austroasiatic taking kb_place_of_articulation during the kb_iron_age .kb_paul_sidwell ( 2018 ) considers the austroasiatic kb_language_family to have rapidly diversified around 4,000 years b.p . during the kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_rice kb_agriculture in kb_indochina , but notes that the kb_evolution of proto-austroasiatic itself is older than that date . the kb_lexicon of proto-austroasiatic can kb_beryllium divided into an early and late stratum . the early stratum consists of kb_base_(chemistry) kb_lexicon including kb_human_body parts , kb_animal names , kb_natural_number features , and pronouns , while the names of kb_cultural_anthropology items ( kb_agriculture terms and kb_lexical_semantics for kb_cultural_anthropology kb_artifact_(archaeology) , which are reconstructable in proto-austroasiatic ) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism part of the later stratum .kb_roger_blench kb_roger_blench ( 2017 ) suggests that vocabulary related to kb_aquatic_plant subsistence strategies ( such as boats , waterways , kb_river kb_fauna , and kb_fish capture techniques ) , can kb_beryllium reconstructed for proto-austroasiatic . kb_roger_blench ( 2017 ) finds widespread austroasiatic kb_semitic_root for 'river , kb_valley ' , 'boat ' , 'fish ' , 'catfish sp . ' , 'eel ' , 'prawn ' , 'shrimp ' ( kb_central_europe austroasiatic ) , 'crab ' , 'tortoise ' , 'turtle ' , 'otter ' , 'crocodile ' , 'heron , kb_fishing kb_bird ' , and 'fish trap ' . kb_archaeology kb_evidence_(law) for the presence of kb_agriculture in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_indochina ( kb_northern_hemisphere kb_vietnam , kb_laos , and kb_other_(philosophy) nearby areas ) dates back to only about 4,000 years b.p . ( 2,000 b.c . ) , with kb_agriculture ultimately kb_being introduced from further up to the kb_north in the kb_yangtze kb_valley where kb_it has been dated to 6,000 b.p .hence , this points to kb_a relatively late riverine dispersal of austroasiatic as compared to kb_sino-tibetan_languages , whose kb_appledesign_powered_speakers had kb_a distinct non-riverine kb_albanian_culture . in kb_addition to living an aquatic-based kb_lifestyle_(sociology) , early austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers would have also had access to kb_livestock , crops , and newer types of watercraft . as early austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways , they would have encountered kb_appledesign_powered_speakers of older kb_language_family kb_world_health_organization were already kb_second_greek_colonisation in the kb_area , such as kb_sino-tibetan_languages .kb_other_(philosophy) than latin-based alphabets , many kb_austroasiatic_languages languages are written with the kb_khmer_alphabet , kb_thai_alphabet , kb_lao_alphabet , and kb_burmese_alphabet alphabets . kb_vietnamese_australian divergently had an kb_indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas script based on kb_chinese_characters logographic writing . this has since been supplanted by the kb_latin_alphabet in the 20th century . the following are examples of past-used alphabets or kb_electric_current alphabets of kb_austroasiatic_languages languages .according to chaubey et al. , `` austro-asiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers in kb_indian_subcontinent today are kb_derived_trait from dispersal from kb_southeast_asia , followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local kb_indian_people populations . '' according to riccio et al. , the kb_munda_languages kb_people_(american_magazine) are likely descended from austroasiatic migrants from kb_southeast_asia .according to zhang et al. , austroasiatic migrations from kb_southeast_asia into kb_indian_subcontinent took kb_place_of_articulation after the kb_last_glacial_maximum glacial maximum , circa 10,000 years ago . arunkumar et kb_aluminium .

kb_terminology `` kb_afroasiatic_languages '' ( often now spelled `` kb_afro-asiatic_languages '' ) . however , kb_it did not come into kb_general_(united_states) use until kb_joseph_greenberg

kb_africa and kb_asia_(roman_province) .kb_individual scholars have also called the kb_family_(biology) `` erythraean '' ( tucker 1966 ) and `` lisramic '' ( hodge kb_1972_wimbledon_championships ) . in lieu of `` hamito-semitic '' , the kb_russian_alphabet linguist kb_igor_diakonoff diakonoffscholars generally treat the kb_afroasiatic_languages kb_language_family as including the following kb_branches_of_science :although there is kb_general_(united_states) kb_agreement_(linguistics) on these six kb_family_(biology) , kb_linguistics kb_world_health_organization kb_science kb_afroasiatic_languages raise some points of disagreement , in kb_particular :in the 9th century , the kb_hebrew_alphabet grammarian kb_judah_ibn_kuraish ibn kb_quraysh of kb_tiaret in kb_algeria was the kb_first_trimester to link kb_2_(number) kb_branches_of_science of kb_afroasiatic_languages together ; kb_he_(letter) perceived kb_a relationship between kb_berber_languages and

kb_rilindja_kombëtare century , europeans also began suggesting such relationships . in 1844 , kb_theodor_benfey benfey suggested kb_a kb_language_family consisting of kb_semitic_languages , kb_berber_languages , and kb_cushitic_languages ( calling the latter `` kb_ge'ez_language '' ) . in the same year , t.n . newman suggested kb_a relationship between kb_semitic_languages and kb_hausa_people , but this would kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) remain kb_a kb_topic_(linguistics) of kb_cleveland_browns_relocation_controversy and kb_uncertainty .kb_friedrich_müller_(linguist) müller kb_english_alphabet#letter_names the traditional hamito-semitic kb_family_(biology) in 1876 in kb_histidine `` grundriss der sprachwissenschaft '' ( `` outline of kb_linguistics '' ) , and kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity kb_it as consisting of kb_a kb_semitic_languages kb_group_(periodic_table) plus kb_a `` hamitic '' kb_group_(periodic_table) containing kb_egyptian_language , kb_berber_languages , and kb_cushitic_languages ; kb_he_(letter) excluded the kb_chadic_languages kb_group_(periodic_table) . kb_it was the kb_egyptology kb_karl_richard_lepsius richard lepsius ( 1810–1884 ) kb_world_health_organization restricted hamitic to the non-semitic languages in kb_africa , which are characterized by kb_a kb_grammatical_gender kb_grammatical_gender system . this `` hamitic kb_hunnic_language kb_group_(periodic_table) '' was kb_anatolian_hypothesis to unite various , mainly north-african , languages , including the kb_ancient_egyptian_medicine kb_hunnic_language , the kb_berber_languages , the kb_cushitic_languages , the kb_beja_language kb_hunnic_language , and the kb_chadic_languages . unlike müller , lepsius considered that kb_hausa_people and kb_nama_languagein 1912 , kb_carl_meinhof meinhof published `` die sprachen der hamiten '' ( `` the languages of the hamites '' ) , in which kb_he_(letter) expanded lepsius 's kb_rutherford_model , adding the kb_fula_language , kb_maasai_language , kb_bari_language , kb_nandi_languages , kb_sandawe_language and kb_hadza_people languages to the hamitic kb_group_(periodic_table) . meinhof 's kb_rutherford_model was widely kb_catalyst_support into the kb_1940s . meinhof 's system of kb_statistical_classification of the hamitic languages was based on kb_a belief that `` kb_appledesign_powered_speakers of hamitic became largely coterminous with kb_cattle herding kb_people's_party_of_armenia with essentially caucasian origins , intrinsically different from and superior to the 'negroes of kb_africa ' . '' however , in the case of the so-called kb_nilo-hamitic_languages languages ( kb_a kb_concept kb_he_(letter) introduced ) , kb_it was based on the kb_linguistic_typology kb_i_shot_andy_warhol of gender and kb_a `` fallacious kb_theory of kb_mixed_language . '' meinhof did this although kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet kb_cold_working by scholars such as lepsius and johnston had substantiated that the languages which kb_he_(letter) would later dub `` nilo-hamitic '' were in kb_fact nilotic languages , with numerous similarities in vocabulary to kb_other_(philosophy) nilotic languages .kb_leo_reinisch reinisch ( 1909 ) had already kb_anatolian_hypothesis linking kb_cushitic_languages and kb_chadic_languages , while urging their more distant affinity with kb_egyptian_language and kb_semitic_languages . however , kb_histidine suggestion found little acceptance . kb_marcel_cohen kb_paul_cohen ( 1924 ) rejected the idea of kb_a distinct `` hamitic '' subgroup , and included kb_hausa_people ( kb_a kb_chadic_languages kb_hunnic_language ) in kb_histidine comparative hamito-semitic vocabulary . finally , kb_joseph_greenberg greenberg 's 1950 kb_cold_working kb_light-emitting_diode to the widespread rejection of `` hamitic '' as kb_a kb_hunnic_language category by kb_linguistics . greenberg refuted meinhof 's kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_theories , and rejected the use of kb_race_(classification_of_human_beings) and kb_social_anarchism kb_evidence_(law) . in dismissing the notion of kb_a separate `` nilo-hamitic '' kb_hunnic_language category in kb_particular , greenberg was `` returning to kb_a view widely held kb_a half century kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet . '' kb_he_(letter) consequently rejoined meinhof 's so-called kb_nilo-hamitic_languages languages with their appropriate nilotic siblings . kb_he_(letter) also added ( and sub-classified ) the kb_chadic_languages , and kb_anatolian_hypothesis the kb_new_world kb_toponymy kb_afroasiatic_languages for the kb_family_(biology) . kb_almost_all all scholars have kb_acceptance#self_acceptance this kb_statistical_classification as the kb_new_world and continued consensus .greenberg 's kb_rutherford_model was fully kb_adaptation in kb_histidine book `` kb_the_languages_of_africa languages of kb_africa '' ( 1963 ) , in which kb_he_(letter) reassigned most of meinhof 's additions to hamitic to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_language_family , notably kb_nilo-saharan . following kb_isaac_schapera schapera and rejecting meinhof , kb_he_(letter) classified the kb_hottentot_language kb_hunnic_language as kb_a member of the kb_khoisan_languages languages , kb_a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of kb_click_consonant sounds . to khoisan kb_he_(letter) also added the tanzanian kb_hadza_people and kb_sandawe_language , though this view has been discredited as kb_linguistics working on these languages consider them to kb_beryllium kb_language_isolate . despite this , greenberg 's kb_statistical_classification remains kb_a starting point for kb_modern_history kb_cold_working of many languages spoken in kb_africa , and the hamitic category ( and its kb_extension_(kinesiology) to nilo-hamitic ) has no part in this .since the kb_triliteral traditional kb_branches_of_science of the hamitic languages ( kb_berber_languages , kb_cushitic_languages and kb_egyptian_language ) have not been shown to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism an exclusive ( kb_monophyly ) kb_phylogenetics kb_units_of_measurement of their own , separate from kb_other_(philosophy) kb_afroasiatic_languages languages , kb_linguistics no longer use the kb_terminology in this kb_word_sense . each of these kb_branches_of_science is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger kb_afroasiatic_languages kb_family_(biology) .in 1969 , kb_harold_c._fleming fleming kb_anatolian_hypothesis that what had previously been known as kb_western_esotericism kb_cushitic_languages is an independent branch of kb_afroasiatic_languages , suggesting for kb_it the kb_new_world kb_toponymy kb_omotic_languages . this proposal and kb_toponymy have kb_methionine with widespread acceptance .several scholars , including kb_harold_c._fleming fleming and kb_robert_hetzron hetzron , have since questioned the traditional inclusion of beja in kb_cushitic_languages .`` kb_glottolog '' does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of kb_omotic_languages has been established , nor that of kb_ongota_language or the unclassified kb_kujarge_language . kb_it therefore splits off the following kb_group_(mathematics) as small kb_family_(biology) : kb_south_omotic_languages , kb_mao_languages , kb_dizoid_languages , kb_gonga–gimojan_languages ( kb_north kb_omotic_languages apart from the

kb_afroasiatic_languages : kb_semitic_languages , kb_egyptian_language , kb_berber_languages , kb_chadic_languages , kb_cushitic_languages , and kb_omotic_languages . however , kb_christopher_ehret ehret ( 1979 ) , kb_harold_c._fleming fleming ( 1981 ) , and kb_joseph_greenberg greenberg ( 1981 ) all agree that the kb_omotic_languages branch split from the rest kb_first_trimester .otherwise

kb_grammatical_number divided by the count of kb_grammatical_number in the kb_class_(set_theory) . the kb_class_(set_theory) is often kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of results of an kb_experiment or an kb_observational_study , or frequently kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of results from kb_a kb_survey_(statistics) . the kb_terminology `` kb_arithmetic kb_mean '' is preferred in some contexts in kb_mathematics and kb_statistics because kb_it helps distinguish kb_it from kb_other_(philosophy) means , such as the kb_geometric_mean and the kb_harmonic_mean .in kb_addition to kb_mathematics and kb_statistics , the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is used frequently in many diverse fields such as kb_economics , kb_anthropological_linguistics , and kb_history , and kb_it is used in almost every academic field to some extent . for example , kb_per_capita_income kb_income is the kb_arithmetic average kb_income of kb_a nation 's kb_population .while the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is often used to report kb_central_tendency , kb_it is not kb_a kb_robust_statistic statistic , kb_meaning_(linguistics) that kb_it is greatly influenced by outliers ( values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values ) . notably , for skewed distributions , such as the kb_distribution_of_income of kb_income for which kb_a few kb_people_(american_magazine) 's incomes are substantially greater than most kb_people_(american_magazine) 's , the kb_arithmetic kb_mean may not coincide with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's notion of `` middle '' , and robust kb_statistics , such as the kb_medes , may kb_beryllium kb_a better description of kb_central_europe tendency .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean ( or kb_mean or average ) , formula_1 ( kb_walter_read formula_2 `` bar '' ) , is the kb_mean of the formula_3 values formula_4 .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is the most commonly used and readily understood kb_measure_(mathematics) of kb_central_europe tendency in kb_a kb_data_set . in kb_statistics , the kb_terminology average refers to any of the measures of kb_central_europe tendency . the kb_arithmetic kb_mean of kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of observed kb_big_data is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as kb_being equal to the kb_addition of the numerical values of each and every kb_observation divided by the total kb_grammatical_number of kb_observations_(pierre_belon) . symbolically , if we have kb_a kb_data_set consisting of the values formula_5 , then the kb_arithmetic kb_mean formula_6 is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity by the kb_chemical_formula :( kb_episcopal_see kb_summation for an explanation of the kb_summation_operator ) .for example , let kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of kb_a firm : 2500 , 2700 , 2400 , 2300 , 2550 , 2650 , 2750 , 2450 , 2600 , 2400. the kb_arithmetic kb_mean isif the kb_data_set is kb_a kb_statistical_population ( i.e. , consists of every possible kb_observation and not just kb_a subset of them ) , then the kb_mean of that kb_population is called the kb_population kb_mean . if the kb_data_set is kb_a kb_sampling_(statistics) ( kb_a subset of the kb_population ) , we call the statistic resulting from this kb_calculation kb_a kb_sample_(statistics) kb_mean .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean has several kb_chemical_property that make kb_it useful , especially as kb_a kb_measure_(mathematics) of kb_central_europe tendency . these include :the kb_arithmetic kb_mean may kb_beryllium contrasted with the kb_medes . the kb_medes is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity such that no more than half the values are larger than , and no more than half are smaller than , the kb_medes . if kb_chemical_element in the kb_big_data kb_arithmetic_progression arithmeticallyif kb_a numerical kb_property , and any kb_sample_(statistics) of kb_big_data from kb_it , could kb_take on any kb_lightness from kb_a kb_continuous_function range , instead of , for example , just integers , then the kb_probability of kb_a kb_grammatical_number falling into some range of possible values can kb_beryllium described by integrating kb_a kb_continuous_probability_distribution distribution across this range , even when the naive kb_probability for kb_a kb_sample_(statistics) kb_grammatical_number taking kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) certain kb_lightness from infinitely many is kb_0_(number) . the kb_analog_device of kb_a kb_weighted_average average in this kb_context_(language_use) , in which there are an kb_infinite_set kb_grammatical_number of possibilities for the precise kb_lightness of the variable in each range , is called the `` kb_mean of the kb_probability_distribution '' . kb_a most widely encountered kb_probability_distribution is called the kb_normal_distribution distribution ; kb_it has the kb_property that all measures of its kb_central_europe tendency , including not just the kb_mean but also the aforementioned kb_medes and the kb_musical_mode ( the kb_triliteral kb_mole_(unit) 's ) , are equal to each kb_other_(philosophy) . this equality does not hold for kb_other_(philosophy) kb_probability distributions , as illustrated for the kb_lognormal_distribution distribution here

artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range . kb_a kb_solid_solution to this problem is to use the kb_optimization_theory formulation ( kb_viz. , define the kb_mean as the kb_central_europe point : the point about which kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) has the lowest kb_dispersion_(optics) ) , and redefine the difference as kb_a modular kb_distance ( i.e. , the kb_distance on the kb_circle : kb_sulfate the modular kb_distance between 1° and 359° is 2° , not 358° ) .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is often denoted by kb_a bar , for example as in formula_1 (

kb_einstein–szilárd_letter to yvonne davet , orwell described `` kb_animal_farm_(1954_film) '' as kb_a kb_satire tale against kb_joseph_stalin ( `` '' '' '' ) , and in kb_histidine essay `` kb_why_i_write kb_iodine write '' ( 1946 ) , wrote that `` kb_animal_farm_(1954_film) '' was the kb_first_trimester book in which kb_he_(letter) tried , with full consciousness of what kb_he_(letter)

'' which is primarily used by the kb_sheep on the kb_farm , often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing on the kb_nature of kb_#animalism .later , kb_napoleon and kb_histidine pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law-breaking . the changed commandments are as follows , with the changes bolded :eventually , these are replaced with the maxims , `` all kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing are equal , but some kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing are more equal than others '' , and `` four kb_human_leg good , kb_2_(number) kb_human_leg better ! '' as the pigs become more kb_human . this is an kb_irony twist to the original purpose of the seven commandments , which were supposed to keep kb_order_(biology) within kb_animal_farm_(1954_film) by uniting the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing together against the humans and preventing kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing from following the humans ' kb_evil habits . through the revision of the commandments , orwell demonstrates how simply kb_politics kb_dogma can kb_beryllium turned into kb_malleability kb_propagandaorwell biographer jeffrey meyers has written , `` virtually every detail has kb_politics kb_importance in this kb_allegory .

kb_tetrapod vertebrates of the kb_class_(biology) amphibia . kb_modern_history amphibians are all kb_lissamphibia . they inhabit kb_a wide kb_variety_(magazine) of habitats , with most kb_species living within kb_terrestrial_animal , kb_fossorial , kb_arboreal or kb_freshwater kb_aquatic_ecosystems . thus amphibians typically start out as kb_larvae living in kb_water , but some kb_species have kb_adaptation behavioural adaptations to bypass this . the kb_thomas_young_(scientist) generally undergo kb_metamorphosis from kb_larva with gills to an adult air-breathing kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism with kb_artificial_lung . amphibians use their kb_skin as kb_a kb_secondary_school kb_respiration_(physiology) kb_surface_(topology) and some small kb_terrestrial_animal salamanders and frogs lack kb_artificial_lung and rely entirely on their kb_skin . they are superficially similar to kb_lizards but , along with mammals and kb_birds , reptiles are amniotes and do not require kb_water bodies in which to kb_breed . with their kb_complex_number reproductive needs and permeable kb_seed_coat , amphibians are often ecological indicators ; in

features that were helpful in adapting to dry kb_albanian_land_force . they diversified and became kb_dominant_allele during the kb_carboniferous and kb_permian periods , but were later displaced by reptiles and kb_other_(philosophy) vertebrates . over kb_time_(magazine) , amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity , leaving only the kb_modern_history subclass kb_lissamphibia .the kb_triliteral kb_modern_history kb_order_(biology) of amphibians are kb_anura_(frog) ( the frogs and toads ) , kb_urodela ( the salamanders ) , and kb_caecilian ( the caecilians ) . the kb_grammatical_number of known kb_amphibian kb_species is approximately 7,000 , of which nearly 90 % are frogs . the smallest kb_amphibian ( and kb_vertebrate ) in the kb_world_war_ii is kb_a kb_frog from kb_new_guinea ( `` kb_paedophryne_amauensis amauensis '' ) with kb_a kb_length of just . the kb_largest_organisms living kb_amphibian is the kb_chinese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias davidianus '' ) , but this is dwarfed by the kb_extinct `` kb_prionosuchus '' from the middle kb_permian of kb_brazil . the kb_science of amphibians is called kb_batrachology , while the kb_science of both reptiles and amphibians is called kb_herpetologykb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_amphibian '' is kb_derived_trait from the kb_ancient_greek kb_terminology ἀμφίβιος ( `` amphíbios '' ) , which means `` both kinds of kb_life_(magazine) '' , `` ἀμφί '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` of both kinds '' and `` βιος '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_life_(magazine) '' . the kb_terminology was initially used as kb_a kb_general_(united_states) kb_adjective for kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing that could live on kb_albanian_land_force or in kb_water , including kb_pinniped and otters . traditionally , the kb_class_(biology) amphibia includes all kb_tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes . amphibia in its widest kb_word_sense ( `` kb_sensu_lato '' ) was divided into kb_triliteral kb_class_(biology)the actual kb_grammatical_number of kb_species in each kb_group_(periodic_table) depends on the kb_taxonomy_(general) kb_statistical_classification followed . the kb_2_(number) most common kb_systems_analysis are the kb_statistical_classification kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by the website amphibiaweb , kb_university_of_california kb_california , kb_george_berkeley and the kb_statistical_classification by kb_herpetology kb_darrel_frost frost and the kb_american_museum_of_natural_history of kb_natural_number kb_history , kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance as the online reference database `` kb_amphibian kb_species of the kb_world_war_ii '' . the kb_grammatical_number of kb_species cited above follows frost and the total kb_grammatical_number of known kb_amphibian kb_species is over 7,000 , of which nearly 90 % are frogs .with the kb_phylogenetics kb_statistical_classification , the taxon kb_labyrinthodontia has been discarded as kb_it is kb_a kb_paraphyly kb_group_(periodic_table) without unique kb_definable_set features apart from kb_cladistics#plesiomorphy kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) characteristics . kb_statistical_classification varies according to the preferred kb_phylogeny of the author and whether they use kb_a kb_cladistics#three_definitions_of_clade or kb_a node-based kb_statistical_classification . traditionally , amphibians as kb_a kb_class_(biology) are kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as all tetrapods with kb_a larval stage , while the kb_group_(periodic_table) that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians ( frogs , salamanders and caecilians ) and all their descendants is called kb_lissamphibia . the kb_phylogeny of kb_paleozoic amphibians is kb_uncertainty , and kb_lissamphibia may possibly fall within kb_extinct kb_group_(mathematics) , like the kb_temnospondyli ( traditionally placed in the subclass kb_labyrinthodontia ) or the kb_lepospondyli , and in some analyses even in the amniotes . this means that advocates of kb_phylogenetic_nomenclature have removed kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of kb_basal_(phylogenetics) kb_devonian and kb_carboniferous amphibian-type kb_tetrapod kb_group_(mathematics) that were formerly placed in amphibia in kb_linnaean_taxonomy kb_taxonomy_(biology) , and included them elsewhere under kb_cladistic_taxonomy . if the kb_common_descent kb_ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in amphibia , kb_it becomes kb_a kb_paraphyly kb_group_(periodic_table) .all kb_modern_history amphibians are included in the subclass kb_lissamphibia , which is usually considered kb_a kb_clade , kb_a kb_group_(periodic_table) of kb_species that have kb_evolution_of_tetrapods from kb_a kb_common_descent kb_ancestor . the kb_triliteral kb_modern_history kb_order_(biology) are kb_anura_(frog) ( the frogs and toads ) , kb_caudata ( or kb_urodela , the salamanders ) , and kb_gymnophiona ( or kb_caecilian , the caecilians ) . kb_it has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from kb_a temnospondyl-like kb_ancestor , and even that caecilians are the kb_sister_group kb_group_(periodic_table) of the advanced kb_reptiliomorpha amphibians , and thus of amniotes . although the fossils of several older proto-frogs with kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) characteristics are known , the oldest `` kb_truth kb_frog '' is `` kb_prosalirus_bitis bitis '' , from the kb_early_jurassic kb_jurassic kb_kayenta_formation formation of arizona . kb_it is anatomically very similar to kb_modern_history frogs . the oldest known kb_caecilian is another kb_early_jurassic kb_jurassic kb_species , `` kb_eocaecilia_micropodia micropodia '' , also from arizona . the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century kb_salamander is `` kb_beiyanerpeton_jianpingensis jianpingensis '' from the kb_late_jurassic kb_jurassic of kb_northern_mountain_range_(albania) kb_china .authorities disagree as to whether salientia is kb_a kb_superorder that includes the kb_order_(biology) kb_anura_(frog) , or whether kb_anura_(frog) is kb_a sub-order of the kb_order_(biology) salientia . the kb_lissamphibia are traditionally divided into kb_triliteral kb_order_(biology) , but an kb_extinct salamander-like kb_family_(biology) , the kb_albanerpetontidae , is now considered part of kb_lissamphibia alongside the kb_superorder salientia . furthermore , salientia includes all kb_triliteral recent kb_order_(biology) plus the kb_triassic proto-frog , `` kb_triadobatrachus '' .the kb_first_trimester kb_major_(united_states) kb_group_(mathematics) of amphibians kb_adaptation in the kb_devonian period , around 370 million years ago , from kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish which were similar to the kb_modern_history kb_coelacanth and kb_lungfish . these kb_ancient_history kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish had kb_evolution_of_tetrapods multi-jointed leg-like kb_fish_fin with digits that enabled them to crawl along the kb_sea_(astronomy) bottom . some kb_fish had kb_adaptation kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) kb_artificial_lung to help them breathe kb_air_(classical_element) when the stagnant pools of the kb_devonian swamps were low in kb_oxygen . they could also use their kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_fish_fin to hoist themselves out of the kb_water and onto dry kb_albanian_land_force if circumstances kb_sulfate required . eventually , their bony kb_fish_fin would kb_evolution into kb_limb_(anatomy) and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods , including kb_modern_history amphibians , reptiles , kb_birds , and mammals . despite kb_being able to crawl on kb_albanian_land_force , many of these kb_prehistory kb_tetrapodomorph kb_fish still spent most of their kb_time_(magazine) in the kb_water . they had started to develop kb_artificial_lung , but still breathed predominantly with gills .many examples of kb_species showing kb_transitional_fossil features have been discovered . `` kb_ichthyostega '' was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) amphibians , with nostrils and more efficient kb_artificial_lung . kb_it had four sturdy kb_limb_(anatomy) , kb_a kb_neck , kb_a kb_tail with kb_fish_fin and kb_a skull very similar to that of the kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish , `` kb_eusthenopteron '' . amphibians kb_evolution_of_tetrapods adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the kb_water for longer periods . their kb_artificial_lung improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger , better able to support the weight of their bodies on kb_albanian_land_force . they kb_adaptation `` hands '' and `` kb_foot '' with five or more digits ; the kb_skin became more capable of retaining kb_human_body fluids and resisting kb_desiccation . the kb_fish 's kb_hyomandibula kb_bone in the kb_hyoid_bone kb_region behind the gills diminished in size and became the kb_stapes of the kb_amphibian kb_ear , an kb_adaptation necessary for kb_hearing_loss on dry kb_albanian_land_force . an affinity between the amphibians and the kb_teleost kb_fish is the multi-folded kb_structure of the kb_tooth and the paired kb_occipital_bone kb_bones_(studio)at the end of the kb_devonian period ( 360 million years ago ) , the seas , kb_list_of_rivers_of_alberta and kb_list_of_lakes_in_alberta were teeming with kb_life_(magazine) while the kb_albanian_land_force was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates , though some , such as `` kb_ichthyostega '' , may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the kb_water . kb_it is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs , dragging their hindquarters in kb_a similar manner to that used by the kb_elephant_seal . in the early kb_carboniferous ( 360 to 345 million years ago ) , the kb_climate_of_albania became wet and warm . extensive swamps kb_adaptation with mosses , ferns , horsetails and kb_calamites . air-breathing arthropods kb_evolution_of_tetrapods and invaded the kb_albanian_land_force where they provided kb_food_industry for the kb_carnivore amphibians that began to kb_ego_psychology to the kb_terrestrial_animal environment . there were no kb_other_(philosophy) tetrapods on the kb_albanian_land_force and the amphibians were at the top of the kb_food_chain , occupying the ecological kb_positional_notation currently held by the kb_crocodile . though equipped with kb_limb_(anatomy) and the ability to breathe kb_air_(classical_element) , most still had kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) tapering kb_human_body and kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_tail . they were the top kb_albanian_land_force kb_predation , sometimes reaching several metres in kb_length , preying on the kb_prespa_lake insects of the period and the many types of kb_fish in the kb_water . they still needed to return to kb_water to lay their shell-less kb_eggs_as_food , and even most kb_modern_history amphibians have kb_a fully kb_aquatic_plant larval stage with gills like their kb_fish ancestors . kb_it was the development of the kb_amniote egg , which prevents the developing kb_embryo from drying out , that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on kb_albanian_land_force and which kb_light-emitting_diode to their kb_dominance_(ecology) in the period that followed .after the kb_carboniferous_rainforest_collapse collapse kb_amphibian kb_dominance_(ecology) gave way to reptiles , and amphibians were further devastated by the kb_permian–triassic_extinction_event kb_extinction_event . during the kb_triassic ( 250 to 200 million years ago ) , the reptiles continued to out-compete the amphibians , leading to kb_a kb_redox in both the amphibians ' size and their importance in the kb_biosphere . according to the kb_fossil_record , kb_lissamphibia , which includes all kb_modern_history amphibians and is the only surviving lineage , may have branched off from the kb_extinct kb_group_(mathematics) kb_temnospondyli and kb_lepospondyli at some period between the late kb_carboniferous and the early kb_triassic . the relative kb_scarcity of kb_fossil kb_evidence_(law) precludes precise dating , but the most recent kb_molecular_genetics kb_science , based on kb_multilocus_sequence_typing sequence typing , suggests kb_a late carboniferous/early kb_permianthe origins and evolutionary relationships between the kb_triliteral main kb_group_(mathematics) of amphibians is kb_a kb_matter of kb_abortion_debate . kb_a kb_2005_games_of_the_small_states_of_europe kb_molecular_genetics kb_phylogeny , based on kb_ribosomal_dna kb_analysis , suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each kb_other_(philosophy) than they are to frogs . kb_it also appears that the kb_divergence of the kb_triliteral kb_group_(mathematics) took kb_place_of_articulation in the kb_paleozoic or early kb_mesozoic ( around 250 million years ago ) , before the breakup of the kb_supercontinent kb_pangaea and soon after their kb_divergence from the kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish . the briefness of this period , and the swiftness with which kb_radiation took kb_place_of_articulation , would help account for the relative kb_scarcity of kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) kb_amphibian fossils . there are kb_prespa_lake gaps in the kb_fossil_record , but the discovery of kb_a kb_gerobatrachus_hottoni hottoni from the early kb_permian in kb_texas in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 provided kb_a missing link with many of the characteristics of kb_modern_history frogs . kb_molecular_phylogenetics suggests that the frog–salamander kb_divergence took kb_place_of_articulation considerably

million years ago , and that kb_stereospondyli are the closest relatives to the caecilians .as they kb_evolution_of_tetrapods from lunged kb_fish , amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on kb_albanian_land_force , including the need to develop kb_new_world means of locomotion . in the kb_water , the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward , but on kb_albanian_land_force , quite different mechanisms were required . their vertebral columns , kb_limb_(anatomy) , kb_lunar_limb girdles and musculature needed to kb_beryllium kb_strong_nuclear_force enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding . kb_terrestrial_animal adults discarded their kb_lateral_line kb_line_(geometry) kb_systems_analysis and adapted their kb_sensory_system

amniotes , the kb_eggs_as_food of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes , some of which are impervious . lacking these membranes , amphibians require kb_water bodies for kb_biological_reproduction , although some kb_species have kb_adaptation various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable kb_aquatic_plant larval stage . they are not found in the kb_sea_(astronomy) with the exception of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or kb_2_(number) frogs that live in kb_brackish_water kb_water in kb_mangrove swamps ; the anderson 's kb_salamander meanwhile occurs in brackish or kb_salt_(chemistry) kb_water kb_list_of_lakes_in_alberta . on kb_albanian_land_force , amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their kb_skin damp .the smallest kb_amphibian ( and kb_vertebrate ) in the kb_world_war_ii is kb_a kb_microhylid kb_frog from kb_new_guinea ( `` kb_paedophryne_amauensis amauensis '' ) kb_first_trimester discovered in 2012. kb_it has an average kb_length of and is part of kb_a kb_genus that contains four of the kb_world_war_ii 's ten smallest kb_frog kb_species . the kb_largest_organisms living kb_amphibian is the kb_chinese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias davidianus '' ) but this is kb_a great deal smaller than the kb_largest_organisms kb_amphibian that ever existed—the kb_extinct `` kb_prionosuchus '' , kb_a crocodile-like temnospondyl dating to 270 million years ago from the middle kb_permian of kb_brazil ! the kb_largest_organisms kb_frog is the kb_african_plate kb_goliath_frog kb_frog ( `` conraua goliath '' ) , which can reach and weigh .amphibians are ectothermic ( cold-blooded ) vertebrates that do not maintain their kb_human_body kb_temperature through internal kb_physiology processes . their kb_metabolic_rate is low and as kb_a result , their kb_food_industry and kb_energy_industry kb_requirement_analysis are limited . in the adult kb_state_of_matter , they have tear ducts and movable eyelids , and most kb_species have kb_ears that can detect airborne or kb_ground_vibrations vibrations . they have muscular tongues , which in many kb_species can kb_beryllium protruded . kb_modern_history amphibians have fully kb_ossification vertebrae with kb_articular_processes processes . their ribs are usually short and may kb_beryllium fused to the vertebrae . their skulls are mostly broad and short , and are often incompletely kb_ossification . their kb_skin contains little kb_keratin and lacks kb_fish_scale , apart from kb_a few fish-like kb_fish_scale in certain caecilians . the kb_skin contains many mucous glands and in some kb_species , kb_skin ( kb_a kb_type_(biology) of granular kb_gland ) . the hearts of amphibians have kb_triliteral kb_bicameralism , kb_2_(number) kb_atrium_(heart) and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_ventricle_(heart) . they have kb_a kb_urinary_bladder kb_bladder and kb_metabolic_waste#nitrogen_wastes waste products are excreted primarily as kb_urea . most amphibians lay their kb_eggs_as_food in kb_water and have kb_aquatic_plant kb_larvae that undergo kb_metamorphosis to become kb_terrestrial_animal adults . amphibians breathe by means of kb_a pump action in which kb_air_(classical_element) is kb_first_trimester kb_drawing_(metalworking) into the kb_buccopharyngeal_membrane kb_region through the nostrils . these are then closed and the kb_air_(classical_element) is forced into the kb_artificial_lung by kb_contraction_(grammar) of the throat . they supplement this with kb_gas_exchangethe kb_order_(biology) kb_anura_(frog) ( from the kb_ancient_greek `` kb_a ( kb_neutron ) - kb_seed_coat are known as toads . the difference is not kb_a formal kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) taxonomically and there are numerous kb_non-linear_writing to this rule . members of the kb_family_(biology) kb_bufonidae are known as the `` kb_truth toads '' . frogs range in size from the kb_goliath_frog kb_frog ( `` conraua goliath '' ) of kb_west_africa to the `` kb_paedophryne_amauensis amauensis '' , kb_first_trimester described in kb_papua_new_guinea kb_new_guinea in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2012 , which is also the smallest known kb_vertebrate . although most kb_species are associated with kb_water and damp habitats , some are specialised to live in kb_trees or in deserts . they are found worldwide except for kb_polar_molecule areas .kb_anura_(frog) is divided into kb_triliteral suborders that are broadly kb_acceptance#self_acceptance by the kb_scientific_community , but the relationships between some kb_family_(biology) remain unclear . future kb_molecular_genetics studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships . the suborder kb_archaeobatrachia contains four kb_family_(biology) of kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) frogs . these are kb_ascaphidae , kb_bombinatoridae , kb_discoglossidae and kb_leiopelmatidae which have few kb_derived_trait features and are probably kb_paraphyly with regard to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_frog kb_lineage_(anthropology) . the six kb_family_(biology) in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder kb_mesobatrachia are the kb_fossorial kb_megophryidae , kb_pelobatidae , kb_pelodytidae , kb_scaphiopodidae and kb_rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily kb_aquatic_plant kb_pipidae . these have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the kb_2_(number) kb_other_(philosophy) suborders . kb_neobatrachiathe kb_order_(biology) kb_caudata ( from the kb_latin `` cauda '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_tail '' ) consists of the salamanders—elongated , low-slung kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing that mostly resemble kb_lizards in kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . this is kb_a kb_symplesiomorphy kb_trait_theory and they are no more closely related to kb_lizards than they are to mammals . salamanders lack claws , have scale-free kb_seed_coat , either smooth or covered with tubercles , and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned . they range in size from the kb_chinese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias davidianus '' ) , which has been reported to grow to kb_a kb_length of , to the diminutive `` kb_thorius_pennatulus pennatulus '' from kb_mexico which seldom exceeds in kb_length . salamanders have kb_a mostly laurasian distribution , kb_being present in much of the kb_holarctic kb_region of the kb_northern_hemisphere . the kb_family_(biology) kb_plethodontidae is also found in kb_central_america and kb_south_america kb_north of the kb_amazon_basin ; kb_south_america was apparently invaded from kb_central_america by about the start of the kb_miocene , 23 million years ago . kb_urodela is kb_a kb_toponymy sometimes used for all the kb_extant_taxon kb_species of salamanders . members of several kb_salamander kb_family_(biology) have become kb_neotenythe suborder kb_cryptobranchoidea contains the kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) salamanders . kb_a kb_grammatical_number of kb_fossil cryptobranchids have been found , but there are only kb_triliteral living kb_species , the kb_chinese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias davidianus '' ) , the kb_japanese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias japonicus '' ) and the kb_hellbender ( `` cryptobranchus alleganiensis '' ) from kb_north_america . these kb_prespa_lake amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult kb_state_of_matter ; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded . kb_a unique kb_i_shot_andy_warhol is their ability to kb_animal_feed by suction , depressing either the kb_left-wing_politics side of their lower kb_jaw or the kb_right-wing_politics . the males excavate nests , persuade females to lay their egg kb_string_section inside them , and guard them . as kb_water_well as breathing with kb_artificial_lung , they respire through the many kb_fold_(geology) in their thin kb_skin , which has kb_capillary close to the kb_surface_(topology) .the suborder kb_salamandroidea contains the advanced salamanders . they differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused kb_mandible kb_bones_(studio) in the lower kb_jaw , and by using internal fertilisation . in salamandrids , the kb_male kb_deposit_(geology) kb_a bundle of kb_sperm , the kb_spermatophore , and the female picks kb_it up and inserts kb_it into her kb_cloaca where the kb_sperm is stored until the kb_eggs_as_food are laid . the kb_largest_organisms kb_family_(biology) in this kb_group_(periodic_table) is kb_plethodontidae , the lungless salamanders , which includes 60 % of all kb_salamander kb_species . the kb_family_(biology) kb_salamandridae includes the kb_truth salamanders and the kb_toponymy `` kb_newt '' is given to members of its kb_subfamily kb_pleurodelinae .the kb_ipad_(third_generation) suborder , kb_sirenoidea , contains the four kb_species of kb_siren_(genus) , which are in kb_a kb_single_bond kb_family_(biology) , kb_sirenidae . members of this kb_order_(biology) are eel-like kb_aquatic_plant salamanders with much kb_redox forelimbs and no hind kb_limb_(anatomy) . some of their features are kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) while others are kb_derived_trait . fertilisation is likely to kb_beryllium kb_external_fertilization as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by kb_male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecaethe kb_order_(biology) kb_gymnophiona ( from the kb_ancient_greek `` gymnos '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` naked '' and `` ophis '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` serpent '' ) or kb_caecilian ( from the kb_latin `` an- '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` without '' and the kb_ancient_greek `` poda '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_human_leg '' ) comprises the caecilians . these are kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , cylindrical , limbless kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing with kb_a snake- or kb_annelid kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . the adults vary in kb_length from kb_group_8_element to 75 centimetres ( 3 to 30 inches ) with the exception of kb_thomas_thomson_(chemist) 's kb_caecilian ( `` caecilia thompsoni '' ) , which can reach . kb_a kb_caecilian 's kb_skin has kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of kb_transverse_wave kb_fold_(geology) and in some kb_species contains tiny kb_embedded_system dermal kb_fish_scale . kb_it has rudimentary eyes covered in kb_skin , which are probably limited to discerning differences in kb_light intensity . kb_it also has kb_a pair of short tentacles near the kb_human_eye that can kb_beryllium extended and which have kb_somatosensory_system and kb_olfaction functions . most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp kb_soil , in rotten kb_wood and under kb_plant debris , but some are kb_aquatic_plant . most kb_species lay their kb_eggs_as_food underground and when the kb_larvae hatch , they make their way to adjacent bodies of kb_water . others brood their kb_eggs_as_food and the kb_larvae undergo kb_metamorphosis before the kb_eggs_as_food hatch . kb_a few kb_species give birth to live kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the kb_oviduct . caecilians have kb_a mostly gondwanan kb_structure contains some typical characteristics common to kb_terrestrial_animal vertebrates , such as the presence of highly kb_keratin#cornification outer layers , renewed periodically through kb_a moulting process controlled by the kb_pituitary_gland and kb_thyroid glands . local thickenings ( often called warts ) are common , such as those found on toads . the outside of the kb_skin is shed periodically mostly in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) piece , in kb_contrast_(vision) to mammals and kb_birds where kb_it is shed in kb_lithic_flake . amphibians often kb_eat_(film) the sloughed kb_skin . caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal kb_fish_scale kb_embedded_system in the kb_dermis between the furrows in the kb_skin . the similarity of these to the kb_fish_scale of kb_bony_fish kb_fish is largely superficial . kb_lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony kb_deposit_(geology) in the kb_dermis , but this is an example of kb_convergent_evolutionkb_amphibian kb_skin is permeable to kb_water . kb_gas_exchange can kb_take kb_place_of_articulation through the kb_skin ( kb_cutaneous_respiration respiration ) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the kb_surface_(topology) of kb_water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds . to compensate for their thin and delicate kb_skin , amphibians have kb_evolution_of_tetrapods mucous glands , principally on their heads , backs and tails . the secretions produced by these help keep the kb_skin moist . in kb_addition , most kb_species of kb_amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or kb_poisonous substances . some kb_amphibian toxins can kb_beryllium lethal to humans while others have little effect . the main poison-producing glands , the kb_parotoid_gland , produce the kb_neurotoxin kb_bufotoxin and are located behind the kb_ears of toads , along the backs of frogs , behind the eyes of salamanders and on the kb_upper_egypt kb_surface_(topology) of caecilians .the kb_skin colour of amphibians is produced by kb_triliteral layers of kb_pigment kb_cell_(biology) called chromatophores . these kb_triliteral kb_cell_(biology) layers consist of the melanophores ( occupying the deepest layer ) , the guanophores ( forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules , producing kb_a blue-green colour ) and the lipophores ( yellow , the most superficial layer ) . the colour change displayed by many kb_species is initiated by hormones secreted by the kb_pituitary_gland kb_gland . unlike kb_bony_fish kb_fish , there is no direct control of the kb_pigment kb_cell_(biology) by the kb_nervous_system system , and this results in the colour change taking kb_place_of_articulation more slowly than happens in kb_fish . kb_a vividly coloured kb_skin usually indicates that the kb_species is kb_toxicity and is kb_a warning kb_sign_of_the_pagan to kb_predation .amphibians have kb_a kb_skeleton system that is structurally kb_homology_(chemistry) to kb_other_(philosophy) tetrapods , though with kb_a kb_grammatical_number of variations . they all have four kb_limb_(anatomy) except for the legless caecilians and kb_a few kb_species of kb_salamander with kb_redox or no kb_limb_(anatomy) . the kb_bones_(studio) are hollow and lightweight . the musculoskeletal system is kb_strong_nuclear_force to enable kb_it to support the kb_human_head and kb_human_body . the kb_bones_(studio) are fully kb_ossification and the vertebrae kb_interlock with each kb_other_(philosophy) by means of overlapping processes . the kb_pectoral_girdle girdle is kb_catalyst_support by kb_muscle , and the well-developed kb_pelvic_girdle girdle is attached to the backbone by kb_a pair of sacral ribs . the kb_ilium_(bone)in most amphibians , there are four digits on the fore kb_hiking and five on the hind kb_hiking , but no claws on either . some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in kb_appearance_(philosophy) with tiny , stubby kb_human_leg . the kb_siren_(genus) are kb_aquatic_plant salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind kb_limb_(anatomy) . the caecilians are limbless . they kb_burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of kb_muscle kb_contraction_(grammar) moving along the kb_human_body . on the kb_surface_(topology) of the ground or in kb_water they move by undulating their kb_human_body from side to side .in frogs , the hind kb_human_leg are larger than the fore kb_human_leg , especially kb_sulfate in those kb_species that principally move by jumping or swimming . in the walkers and runners the hind kb_limb_(anatomy) are not kb_sulfate kb_prespa_lake , and the burrowers mostly have short kb_limb_(anatomy) and broad bodies . the kb_foot have adaptations for the way of kb_life_(magazine) , with webbing between the toes for swimming , broad kb_adhesive toe pads for climbing , and keratinised tubercles on the hind kb_foot for digging ( frogs usually dig backwards into the kb_soil ) . in most salamanders , the kb_limb_(anatomy) are short and more or less the same kb_length and kb_project at kb_right-wing_politics angles from the kb_human_body . locomotion on kb_albanian_land_force is by kb_walking and the kb_tail often swings from side to side or is used as kb_a prop , particularly when climbing . in their normal gait , only kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) leg is advanced at kb_a kb_time_(magazine) in the manner kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by their ancestors , the kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish . some salamanders in the kb_genus `` kb_aneides '' and certain kb_lungless_salamander climb kb_trees and have kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_limb_(anatomy) , kb_prespa_lake toepads and prehensile tails . in kb_aquatic_plant salamanders and in kb_frog tadpoles , the kb_tail has kb_dorsum_(anatomy) and kb_ventral_fin kb_fish_fin and is moved from side to side as kb_a means of kb_#propulsion . adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones .salamanders use their tails in kb_arms_industry and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in kb_a process known as kb_autotomyamphibians have kb_a juvenile stage and an adult stage , and the circulatory kb_systems_analysis of the kb_2_(number) are distinct . in the juvenile ( or kb_tadpole ) stage , the circulation is similar to that of kb_a kb_fish ; the two-chambered kb_heart pumps the blood through the gills where kb_it is oxygenated , and is kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) around the kb_human_body and back to the kb_heart in kb_a kb_single_bond loop . in the adult stage , amphibians ( especially frogs ) lose their gills and develop kb_artificial_lung . they have kb_a kb_heart that consists of kb_a kb_single_bond kb_ventricle_(heart) and kb_2_(number) kb_atrium_(heart) . when the kb_ventricle_(heart) starts contracting , deoxygenated blood is pumped through the kb_pulmonary_artery artery to the kb_artificial_lung . continued kb_contraction_(grammar) then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the kb_human_body . mixing of the kb_2_(number) bloodstreams is minimized by the kb_comparative_anatomy of the kb_bicameralism .the kb_nervous_system system is basically the same as in kb_other_(philosophy) vertebrates , with kb_a kb_central_europe kb_brain , kb_a kb_spinal_cord cord , and nerves throughout the kb_human_body . the kb_amphibian kb_brain is less kb_water_well kb_adaptation than that of reptiles , kb_birds and mammals but is similar in kb_morphology_(linguistics) and kb_function_(biology) to that of kb_a kb_fish . kb_it is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving kb_pain_in_amphibians . the kb_brain consists of equal parts , kb_cerebrum , kb_midbrain and kb_cerebellum . various parts of the kb_cerebrum process kb_sensory_system input , such as smell in the kb_olfactory_bulb and sight in the optic lobe , and kb_it is additionally the centre of behaviour and kb_learning . the kb_cerebellum is the center of muscular kb_motor_coordination and the kb_medulla_oblongata controls some kb_organ_(music) functions including heartbeat and respiration . the kb_brain sends signals through the kb_spinal_cord cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the kb_human_body . the kb_pineal_body kb_human_body , known to regulate kb_sleep_(1963_film) patterns in humans , is thought to produce the hormones involved in kb_hibernation and kb_aestivation in amphibians .tadpoles retain the kb_lateral_line_system system of their ancestral fishes , but this is kb_lost_film in kb_terrestrial_animal adult amphibians . some caecilians possess kb_electroreception that allow them to locate kb_object_relations_theory around them when submerged in kb_water . the kb_ears are kb_water_well kb_adaptation in frogs . there is no kb_external_fertilization kb_ear , but the kb_prespa_lake circular kb_tympanum_(anatomy) lies on the kb_surface_(topology) of the kb_human_head just behind the kb_human_eye . this vibrates and kb_sound is transmitted through kb_a kb_single_bond kb_bone , the kb_stapes , to the kb_inner_ear kb_ear . only high-frequency sounds like kb_mating calls are heard in this way , but low-frequency noises can kb_beryllium kb_discovery_of_the_chemical_elements through another kb_mechanism_(biology) . there is kb_a patch of specialized haircells , called `` papilla amphibiorum '' , in the kb_inner_ear kb_ear capable of detecting deeper sounds . another kb_i_shot_andy_warhol , unique to frogs and salamanders , is the columella-operculum kb_complex_number adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the kb_transmission_coefficient of both airborne and seismic signals . the kb_ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly kb_adaptation than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each kb_other_(philosophy) through the kb_list_of_art_mediums of kb_sound .the eyes of tadpoles lack lids , but at kb_metamorphosis , the kb_cornea becomes more dome-shaped , the kb_lens_(anatomy) becomes flatter , and eyelidsmany amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with kb_a sticky tip and drawing kb_it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws . some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey , repeatedly kb_thrust_fault their kb_human_head forward sharply causing the kb_food_industry to move backwards in their mouth by kb_inertia . most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing kb_sulfate they possess voluminous stomachs . the short kb_esophagus is lined with kb_cilium that help to move the kb_food_industry to the kb_stomach and kb_mucus produced by glands in the mouth and kb_pharynx eases its passage . the kb_enzyme kb_chitinase produced in the kb_stomach helps kb_digest_(roman_law) the chitinous kb_cuticle of kb_arthropod prey .amphibians possess kb_a kb_pancreas , kb_liver and kb_gall_bladder kb_bladder . the kb_liver is usually kb_prespa_lake with kb_2_(number) lobes . its size is determined by its kb_function_(biology) as kb_a kb_glycogen and kb_fat storage kb_units_of_measurement , and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up . kb_adipose_tissue kb_tissue_(biology) is another important means of storing kb_energy_industry and this occurs in the kb_abdomen ( in internal kb_structural_analysis called kb_fat bodies ) , under the kb_skin and , in some salamanders , in the kb_tail .there are kb_2_(number) kb_kidneysthe kb_artificial_lung in amphibians are kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) compared to those of amniotes , possessing few internal kb_alveolar_septum and kb_prespa_lake kb_pulmonary_alveolus , and consequently having kb_a comparatively slow kb_diffusion rate for kb_oxygen entering the blood . ventilation is accomplished by kb_buccal_pumping pumping . most amphibians , however , are able to exchange gases with the kb_water or kb_air_(classical_element) via their kb_skin . to enable sufficient kb_cutaneous_respiration respiration , the kb_surface_(topology) of their highly vascularised kb_skin must remain moist to allow the kb_oxygen to diffuse at kb_a sufficiently kb_high_middle_ages rate . because kb_oxygen kb_concentration in the kb_water increases at both low temperatures and kb_high_middle_ages kb_flow_(psychology) kb_rates_(tax) , kb_aquatic_plant amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on kb_cutaneous_respiration respiration , as in the kb_telmatobius_culeus kb_water kb_frog and the kb_cryptobranchus . in kb_air_(classical_element) , where kb_oxygen is more concentrated , some small kb_species can rely solely on cutaneous kb_gas_exchange , most famously the kb_plethodontidae , which have neither kb_artificial_lung nor gills . many kb_aquatic_plant salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage , with some ( such as the kb_axolotlfor the purpose of kb_biological_reproduction most amphibians require kb_fresh_water kb_water although some lay their kb_eggs_as_food on kb_albanian_land_force and have kb_adaptation various means of keeping them moist . kb_a few ( e.g . `` kb_fejervarya_raja raja '' ) can inhabit kb_brackish_water kb_water , but there are no kb_truth kb_ocean amphibians . there are reports , however , of kb_particular kb_amphibian populations unexpectedly invading kb_ocean waters . such was the case with the kb_black_sea invasion of the kb_natural_number kb_hybrid_(biology) `` kb_pelophylax_esculentus esculentus '' reported in 2010 .several hundred kb_frog kb_species in adaptive radiations ( e.g. , `` kb_eleutherodactylus '' , the kb_pacific_ocean `` kb_platymantis '' , the australo-papuan microhylids , and many kb_other_(philosophy) kb_tropical frogs ) , however , do not need any kb_water for kb_breeding_in_the_wild in the kb_wildlife . they reproduce via direct development , an ecological and evolutionary kb_adaptation that has allowed them to kb_beryllium completely independent from free-standing kb_water . kb_almost_all all of these frogs live in wet kb_tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests and their kb_eggs_as_food hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult , passing through the kb_tadpole stage within the egg . reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the kb_quantity of rainfall , but the seasonal timing .in the tropics , many amphibians kb_breed continuously or at any kb_time_(magazine) of year . in kb_temperate_climate kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey , breeding is mostly seasonal , usually in the kb_castalian_spring , and is triggered by increasing day kb_length , rising temperatures or rainfall . experiments have shown the importance of kb_temperature , but the trigger event , especially in kb_arid kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey , is often kb_a storm . in anurans , males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal kb_greek_chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active .in caecilians , fertilisation is internal , the kb_male extruding an kb_intromittent_organ kb_organ_(music) , the phallodeum , and inserting kb_it into the female kb_cloaca . the paired müllerian glands inside the kb_male kb_cloaca secrete kb_a kb_fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian kb_prostate glands and which may kb_transport and nourish the kb_sperm . fertilisation probably takes kb_place_of_articulation in the kb_oviduct .the majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation . in most of these , the kb_male kb_deposit_(geology) kb_a kb_spermatophore , kb_a small packet of kb_sperm on top of kb_a gelatinous kb_conical_surface , on the kb_substratum either on kb_albanian_land_force or in the kb_water . the female takes up the kb_sperm packet by grasping kb_it with the lips of the kb_cloaca and pushing kb_it into the vent . the spermatozoa move to the kb_spermatheca in the roof of the kb_cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may kb_beryllium many months later . courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the kb_spermatophore vary between kb_species . in some , the kb_spermatophore may kb_beryllium placed directly into the female kb_cloaca while in others , the female may kb_beryllium guided to the kb_spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called kb_amplexus . certain kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) salamanders in the kb_family_(biology) kb_sirenidae , kb_hynobiidae and kb_cryptobranchidae practice kb_external_fertilization fertilisation in kb_a similar manner to frogs , with the female laying the kb_eggs_as_food in kb_water and the kb_male releasing kb_sperm onto the egg kb_mass_(liturgy) .with kb_a few kb_non-linear_writing , frogs use kb_external_fertilization fertilisation . the kb_male grasps the female tightly with kb_histidine forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back kb_human_leg , or in the case of `` kb_epipedobates_tricolor tricolor '' , around the kb_neck . they remain in

kb_eggs_as_food are laid in kb_water and kb_larvae are adapted to an kb_aquatic_plant kb_lifestyle_(sociology) . frogs , toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as kb_larvae with kb_external_fertilization gills . kb_metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by kb_thyroxine kb_concentration in the blood , which stimulates kb_metamorphosis , and kb_prolactin , which counteracts kb_thyroxine 's effect . specific events are dependent on kb_threshold_potential values for different kb_tissue_(biology) . because most kb_embryogenesis is outside the parental kb_human_body , kb_it is kb_grammatical_subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of kb_tooth , whisker-like kb_skin extensions or kb_fish_fin . they also make use of kb_a kb_sensory_system kb_lateral_line kb_line_(geometry) kb_organ_(music) similar to that of kb_fish . after kb_metamorphosis ,

surrounded by kb_a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides . this capsule is permeable to kb_water and gases , and swells considerably as kb_it absorbs kb_water . the ovum is at kb_first_trimester rigidly held , but in fertilised kb_eggs_as_food the innermost layer liquefies and allows the kb_embryo to move freely . this also happens in kb_salamander kb_eggs_as_food , even when they are unfertilised . kb_eggs_as_food of some salamanders and frogs contain kb_unicellular_organism kb_green_algae . these penetrate the jelly kb_envelope_(waves) after the kb_eggs_as_food are laid and may increase the supply of kb_oxygen to the kb_embryo through kb_photosynthesis . they seem to both speed up the development of the kb_larvae and reduce mortality . most kb_eggs_as_food contain the kb_pigment kb_melanin which raises their kb_temperature through the absorption of kb_light and also protects them against kb_ultraviolet_radiation . caecilians , some kb_plethodontidae and certain frogs lay kb_eggs_as_food underground that are unpigmented . in the kb_wood_frog ( `` rana sylvatica '' ) , the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to kb_beryllium up to warmer than its surroundings , which is an advantage in its cool kb_northern_hemisphere kb_habitat .the kb_eggs_as_food may kb_beryllium

kb_string_section . in kb_terrestrial_animal caecilians , the kb_eggs_as_food are laid in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams . the amphibious kb_salamander `` kb_ensatina '' attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and kb_semitic_root . the kb_eleutherodactylus_planirostris ( `` kb_eleutherodactylus planirostris '' ) lays kb_eggs_as_food in small kb_group_(mathematics) in the kb_soil where they develop in about kb_2_(number) weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage . the kb_tungara_frog kb_frog ( `` physalaemus pustulosus '' ) builds kb_a floating nest from foam to protect its kb_eggs_as_food . kb_first_trimester kb_a raft is built , then kb_eggs_as_food are laid in the centre , and finally kb_a foam cap is

kb_water and hatch into free-living kb_larvae that complete their development in kb_water and later transform into either kb_aquatic_plant or kb_terrestrial_animal adults . in many kb_species of kb_frog and in most lungless salamanders ( kb_plethodontidae ) , direct development takes kb_place_of_articulation , the kb_larvae growing within the kb_eggs_as_food and emerging as miniature adults . many caecilians and some kb_other_(philosophy) amphibians lay their kb_eggs_as_food on kb_albanian_land_force , and the newly hatched kb_larvae wriggle or are transported to kb_water bodies . some caecilians , the kb_alpine_salamander ( `` salamandra atra '' ) and some of the kb_nectophrynoides toads ( `` nectophrynoides spp . '' ) are kb_viviparity . their kb_larvae kb_animal_feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female 's kb_oviduct , often for kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) periods . kb_other_(philosophy) amphibians , but not caecilians , are kb_ovoviviparous . the kb_eggs_as_food are retained in or on the parent 's kb_human_body , but the kb_larvae subsist on the yolks of their kb_eggs_as_food and receive no nourishment from the adult . the kb_larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth , either before or after kb_metamorphosis , according to their kb_species . the toad kb_genus `` nectophrynoides '' exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or kb_sulfate members .kb_frog kb_larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , kb_vertical_direction flattened tails with kb_fish_fin . the free-living kb_larvae are normally fully kb_aquatic_plant , but the tadpoles of some kb_species ( such as `` kb_nannophrys_ceylonensis ceylonensis '' ) are semi-terrestrial and live among wet kb_rock_(geology) . tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons , gills for respiration ( kb_external_fertilization gills at kb_first_trimester , internal gills later ) , kb_lateral_line kb_line_(geometry) kb_systems_analysis and kb_prespa_lake tails that they use for swimming . newly hatched tadpoles soon develop kb_gill pouches that cover the gills . the kb_artificial_lung develop early and are used as accessory breathing kb_organ_(anatomy) , the tadpoles rising to the kb_water kb_surface_(topology) to gulp kb_air_(classical_element) . some kb_species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs . these kb_larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of kb_skin through which respiration takes kb_place_of_articulation . while tadpoles do not have kb_truth kb_tooth , in most kb_species , the jaws have kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , parallel rows of small kb_keratinized kb_structural_analysis called keradonts surrounded by kb_a horny beak . front kb_human_leg are formed under the kb_gill sac

streams are typically kb_herbivore . pond tadpoles tend to have deep bodies , kb_prespa_lake caudal kb_fish_fin and small mouths ; they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation . stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths , shallow bodies and caudal kb_fish_fin ; they attach themselves to plants and stones and kb_animal_feed on the kb_surface_(topology) kb_adventure_film of kb_algae and kb_bacteria . they also kb_animal_feed on diatoms , filtered from the kb_water through the gills , and stir up the kb_sediment at bottom of the pond , ingesting edible fragments . they have kb_a relatively kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , spiral-shaped gut to enable them to kb_digest_(roman_law) this kb_diet_(nutrition) . some kb_species are kb_carnivore at the kb_tadpole stage , eating insects , smaller tadpoles and kb_fish . kb_thomas_young_(scientist) of the kb_cuban_tree_frog kb_frog ( `` osteopilus septentrionalis '' ) can

reproduce in moving kb_water . pond-type kb_larvae often have kb_a pair of balancers , rod-like kb_structural_analysis on either side of the kb_human_head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with kb_sediment . some members of the kb_genus `` kb_ambystoma '' and `` kb_dicamptodon '' have kb_larvae that never fully develop into the adult kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , but this varies with kb_species and with populations . the kb_northwestern_salamander ( `` kb_ambystoma gracile '' ) is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of these and , depending on kb_environmental_factors factors , either remains permanently in the larval kb_state_of_matter , kb_a condition known as kb_neoteny , or transforms into an adult . both of these are able to kb_breed . kb_neoteny occurs when the kb_animal 's growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low kb_water temperatures that may change the response of the kb_tissue_(biology) to the kb_hormone kb_thyroxine . kb_other_(philosophy) factors that may inhibit kb_metamorphosis include lack of kb_food_industry , lack of kb_micromineral kb_chemical_element and competition from

although kb_wind and kb_hydroelectricity kb_power_(physics) are abundant and underdeveloped , proposals for statewide kb_energy_industry kb_systems_analysis ( e.g . with special kb_single-wire_earth_return#use_in_interties electric interties ) were judged uneconomical ( at the kb_time_(magazine) of the report , 2001 ) due to low ( less than 50¢/gal ) kb_fuel prices , kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) distances and low kb_population . the cost of kb_a gallon of kb_gas in kb_urban_area kb_alaska today is usually 30–60¢ higher than the national average ; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on kb_transportation costs , seasonal usage peaks , nearby kb_petroleum development kb_infrastructure and many

kb_a surplus in kb_state_of_matter kb_petroleum revenues from kb_palm_oil , largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed kb_trans-alaska_pipeline_system pipeline system . the fund was originally kb_anatolian_hypothesis by kb_governor_(united_states) kb_keith_harvey_miller miller on the kb_eve of the 1969 prudhoe bay lease sale , out of kb_fear that the kb_alabama_legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale ( which amounted to kb_usd 900 million ) at once . kb_it was later championed by kb_governor_(united_states) kb_jay_hammond hammond and kb_kenai,_alaska kb_alaska_house_of_representatives hugh malone . kb_it has served as an attractive kb_politics prospect ever since , diverting revenues which would normally kb_beryllium deposited into the kb_general_(united_states) fund .the kb_alaska_constitution was written kb_sulfate as to discourage dedicating kb_state_of_matter funds for kb_a kb_particular purpose . the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this , mostly due to the kb_politics kb_climate_of_albania of distrust existing during the kb_time_(magazine) of its creation . from its initial principal of kb_usd 734,000 , the fund has grown to kb_usd 50 kb_billion as kb_a result of kb_palm_oil royalties and kb_list_of_australian_capital_cities investment programs . most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside kb_alaska . this has kb_light-emitting_diode to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within kb_alaska , though such kb_a stance has never gained kb_momentum .starting in kb_1982_world_rally_championship_season , dividends from the fund 's kb_annual_plant growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans , ranging from an initial kb_usd 1,000 in kb_1982_world_rally_championship_season ( equal to kb_triliteral years ' payout , as the distribution of payments was held up in kb_a lawsuit over the distribution scheme ) to kb_usd 3,269 in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 ( which included kb_a one-time kb_usd 1,200 `` resource rebate '' ) . every year , the kb_state_of_matter kb_alabama_legislature takes out kb_group_8_element % from the earnings , puts 3 % back into the principal for kb_inflation proofing , and the remaining 5 % is distributed to all qualifying alaskans . to qualify for the permanent fund kb_dividend , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) must have lived in the kb_state_of_matter for kb_a kb_minimum of 12 months , maintain constant residency kb_grammatical_subject to allowable absences , and not kb_beryllium kb_grammatical_subject to kb_court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying kb_biological_classification or may kb_grammatical_subject the payment amount to civil garnishment .the permanent fund is often considered to kb_beryllium kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the leading examples of kb_a `` kb_basic_income '' policy in the kb_world_war_ii .the

compared to 17 % nationwide . the kb_peony kb_industry has also taken off , as the kb_growing_season kb_season allows farmers to kb_harvest during kb_a gap in supply elsewhere in the kb_world_war_ii , thereby filling kb_a niche in the kb_flower market .kb_alaska , with no kb_county_(united_states) , lacks county fairs . however , kb_a small assortment of kb_state_of_matter and local fairs ( with

, the ever-improving kb_road_surface highway system began to kb_eclipse the railroad 's importance in kb_alaska 's kb_economy_of_alaska .the railroad played kb_a vital role in kb_alaska 's development , moving kb_cargo into kb_alaska while transporting kb_natural_resources southward ( i.e. , kb_coal from the usibelli kb_coal mine near kb_healy,_alaska to kb_seward,_alaska and kb_gravel from the kb_matanuska_valley kb_valley to kb_anchorage,_alaska ) . kb_it is kb_water_well known for its summertime tour passenger service .the kb_alaska_railroad was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the last

kb_1960s_in_the_united_states and the 1980s , the kb_green_revolution transformed kb_agriculture around kb_the_globe_(toronto_newspaper) globe , with kb_world_war_ii kb_cereal production increasing significantly ( between 70 % and 390 % for kb_wheat and 60 % to 150 % for kb_rice , depending on geographic kb_area ) as kb_world_population doubled . heavy reliance on kb_petrochemicals has raised concerns that kb_palm_oil shortages could increase costs and reduce kb_agriculture output .industrialized kb_agriculture depends on kb_fossil fuels in kb_2_(number) fundamental ways : direct consumption on the kb_farm and manufacture of inputs used on the kb_farm . direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate kb_farm vehicles and kb_machinery .indirect consumption includes the manufacture of kb_fertilizers , kb_pesticides , and kb_farm kb_machinery . in kb_particular , the production of kb_nitrogen_fertilizer can account for over half of kb_agriculture kb_energy_industry usage . together , direct and indirect consumption by kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) farms accounts for about kb_alkaline_earth_metal % of kb_the_nation nation

kb_a discipline of kb_science began in the late 1800s , and grew significantly through the 20th century . although the kb_science of kb_agriculture kb_economics is relatively recent , kb_major_(united_states) trends in kb_agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout kb_history , ranging from tenant farmers and kb_sharecropping in the post-american kb_american_civil_war kb_war kb_southern_united_states kb_sovereign_state to the kb_european_eel kb_feudal system of kb_manorialism . in the united kb_sovereign_state , and elsewhere , kb_food_industry costs attributed to kb_food_processing , distribution , and kb_agricultural_marketing , sometimes referred to as the kb_agricultural_value_chain , have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined . this is related to the greater kb_efficiency of farming , combined with the increased level of kb_value_added ( e.g . more highly processed products ) provided by

kb_eukaryote organisms that are not necessarily closely related , and is thus kb_polyphyletic . including organisms ranging from kb_unicellular_organism kb_microalgae kb_genus , such as `` kb_chlorella '' and the diatoms , to kb_multicellular kb_theory_of_forms , such as the kb_macrocystis_pyrifera kb_kelp , kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_brown_algae which may grow up to 50 kb_mole_(unit) in kb_length . most are kb_aquatic_plant and kb_autotrophic and lack many of the distinct kb_cell_(biology) and kb_tissue_(biology) types , such as stomata , kb_xylem , and kb_phloem , which are found in kb_embryophyte . the kb_largest_organisms and most kb_complex_number kb_ocean kb_algae are called seaweeds , while the most kb_complex_number kb_freshwater kb_theory_of_forms are the kb_charophyta , kb_a kb_division_(mathematics) of kb_green_algae which includes , for example , `` kb_spirogyra '' and the stoneworts .no kb_definition of kb_algae is generally kb_acceptance#self_acceptance . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_definition is that kb_algae `` have kb_chlorophyll as their kb_primary_education kb_photosynthesis kb_pigment and lack kb_a sterile covering of kb_cell_(biology) around their reproductive kb_cell_(biology) '' . although kb_cyanobacteria are often referred to as `` blue-green kb_algae '' , most authorities exclude all kb_prokaryotes from the kb_definition of kb_algae .kb_algae constitute kb_a kb_polyphyletic kb_group_(periodic_table) since they do not include kb_a kb_common_descent kb_ancestor , and although their plastids seem to have kb_a kb_single_bond kb_evolution , from kb_cyanobacteria , they were acquired in different ways . kb_green_algae are examples of kb_algae that have kb_primary_education chloroplasts kb_derived_trait from kb_endosymbiotic_theory kb_cyanobacteria . diatoms and kb_robert_brown_(scottish_botanist_from_montrose) kb_algae are examples of kb_algae with kb_secondary_school chloroplasts kb_derived_trait from

kb_complex_number kb_theory_of_forms of kb_sexual_reproduction kb_biological_reproduction .kb_algae lack the various kb_structural_analysis that characterize kb_embryophyte , such as the phyllids ( leaf-like kb_structural_analysis ) of bryophytes , rhizoids in kb_nonvascular_plants plants , and the kb_semitic_root , kb_leaf , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_organ_(anatomy) found in tracheophytes ( kb_vascular_plants plants ) . most are phototrophic , although some are mixotrophic , deriving kb_energy_industry both from kb_photosynthesis and uptake of kb_organic_chemistry kb_carbon either by kb_osmotrophy , kb_myzocytosis , or kb_phagocytosis . some kb_unicellular_organism kb_species of kb_green_algae , many kb_golden_algae , euglenids , dinoflagellates , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_algae have become heterotrophs ( also called colorless or apochlorotic kb_algae ) , sometimes kb_parasitic , relying entirely on kb_external_fertilization kb_energy_industry sources and have limited or no kb_photosynthesis apparatus . some kb_other_(philosophy) kb_heterotrophic organisms , such as the kb_apicomplexans , are also kb_derived_trait from kb_cell_(biology) whose ancestors possessed plastids , but are not traditionally considered as kb_algae . kb_algae have kb_photosynthesis kb_machinery ultimately kb_derived_trait from kb_cyanobacteria that produce kb_oxygen as kb_a by-product of kb_photosynthesis , unlike kb_other_(philosophy) kb_photosynthesis kb_bacteria such as kb_purple_sulfur_bacteria and kb_green_sulfur_bacteria kb_bacteria . fossilized filamentous kb_algae from the kb_vindhya basin have been dated back to 1.6 to 1.7 kb_billion years ago .the singular `` alga '' is the kb_latin word for `` kb_seaweed '' and retains that kb_meaning_(linguistics) in kb_australian_english . the kb_etymology is obscure . although some speculate that kb_it is related to kb_latin `` algēre '' , `` kb_beryllium cold '' , no kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving is known to associate kb_seaweed with kb_temperature . kb_a more likely source is `` alliga '' , `` binding , entwining '' .the kb_ancient_greek word for kb_seaweed was φῦκος ( `` phŷcos '' ) , which could kb_mean either the kb_seaweed ( probably kb_red_fox kb_algae ) or kb_a kb_red_fox kb_dye kb_derived_trait from kb_it . the kb_latinisation_of_names , `` fūcus '' , meant primarily the kb_kohl_(cosmetics) rouge . the kb_etymology is kb_uncertainty , but kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force candidate has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) been some word related to the kb_biblical פוך ( `` pūk '' ) , `` kb_paint '' ( if not that word itself ) , kb_a kb_kohl_(cosmetics) eye-shadow used by the kb_ancient_history kb_egyptians and kb_other_(philosophy) inhabitants of the kb_eastern_mediterranean . kb_it could kb_beryllium any kb_color : kb_black_sea , kb_red_fox , kb_green_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , or blue .accordingly , the kb_modern_history kb_science of kb_ocean and kb_freshwater kb_algae is called either kb_phycology or algology , depending on whether the kb_ancient_greek or kb_latin kb_root_of_a_function is used . the kb_toponymy `` fucus '' appears in kb_a kb_grammatical_number of kb_taxonthe kb_algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in kb_structure to kb_cyanobacteria . chloroplasts contain circular kb_dna like that in kb_cyanobacteria and are interpreted as representing kb_redox kb_endosymbiotic_theory kb_cyanobacteria . however , the exact kb_evolution of the chloroplasts is different among separate kb_lineage_(anthropology) of kb_algae , reflecting their acquisition during different kb_endosymbiotic_theory events . the table kb_#ecclesiastical_history describes the kb_function_composition of the kb_triliteral kb_major_(united_states) kb_group_(mathematics) of kb_algae . their lineage relationships are shown in the kb_female_body_shape in the kb_upper_egypt kb_right-wing_politics . many of these kb_group_(mathematics) contain some members that are no longer kb_photosynthesis . some retain plastids , but not chloroplasts , while others have kb_lost_film plastids entirely .kb_phylogeny based on kb_plastidkb_carl_linnaeus , in `` kb_species_plantarum '' ( 1753 ) , the starting point for kb_modern_history kb_botanical_nomenclature nomenclature , recognized 14 kb_genus of kb_algae , of which only four are currently considered among kb_algae . in `` kb_10th_edition_of_systema_naturae naturae '' , kb_carl_linnaeus described the kb_genus `` kb_volvox '' and `` kb_corallina '' , and kb_a kb_species of `` kb_acetabularia '' ( as `` kb_madrepora '' ) , among the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing .in 1768 , kb_samuel_gottlieb_gmelin gmelin ( 1744–1774 ) published the `` historia fucorum '' , the kb_first_trimester kb_cold_working dedicated to kb_ocean kb_algae and the kb_first_trimester book on kb_marine_biology to use the then kb_new_world binomial nomenclature of kb_carl_linnaeus . kb_it included elaborate illustrations of kb_seaweed and kb_ocean kb_algae on folded kb_leaf .kb_w.h.harvey ( 1811–1866 ) and kb_lamouroux ( 1813 ) were the kb_first_trimester to divide kb_macroscopic_scale kb_algae into four kb_division_(sport) based on their pigmentation . this is the kb_first_trimester use of kb_a biochemical criterion in kb_plant systematics . harvey 's four kb_division_(sport) are : kb_red_fox kb_algae ( rhodospermae ) , kb_robert_brown_(scottish_botanist_from_montrose) kb_algae ( melanospermae ) , kb_green_algae ( chlorospermae ) , and diatomaceae .at this kb_time_(magazine) , kb_microscopic_scale kb_algae were discovered and reported by kb_a different kb_group_(periodic_table) of workers ( e.g. , kb_otto_friedrich_müller f. müller and kb_christian_gottfried_ehrenberg ) studying the kb_infusoria ( kb_microscopic_scale organisms ) . unlike kb_macroalgae , which were clearly viewed as plants , kb_microalgae were frequently considered kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing because they are often kb_motility . even the nonmotile ( coccoid ) kb_microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the kb_biological_life_cycle of plants , kb_macroalgae , or kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing .although used as kb_a kb_taxonomy_(general) category in some pre-darwinian kb_biological_classification , e.g. , kb_carl_linnaeus ( 1753 ) , kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann jussieu ( 1789 ) , horaninow ( 1843 ) , agassiz ( 1859 ) , wilson & cassin ( 1864 ) , in further kb_biological_classification , the `` kb_algae '' are seen as an artificial , kb_polyphyletic kb_group_(periodic_table) .throughout the 20th century , most kb_biological_classification treated the following kb_group_(mathematics) as kb_division_(sport) or classes of kb_algae : cyanophytes , rhodophytes , chrysophytes , xanthophytes , kb_diatom , phaeophytes , kb_dinoflagellate#history ( kb_cryptomonad and dinophytes ) , euglenophytes , and kb_chlorophyta . later , many kb_new_world kb_group_(mathematics) were discovered ( e.g. , kb_bolidophyceae ) , and others were splintered from older kb_group_(mathematics) : charophytes and glaucophytes ( from kb_chlorophyta ) , many heterokontophytes ( e.g. , kb_synurophyceae from chrysophytes , or eustigmatophytes from xanthophytes ) , haptophytes ( from chrysophytes ) , and chlorarachniophytes ( from xanthophytes ) .with the abandonment of plant-animal dichotomous kb_statistical_classification , most kb_group_(mathematics) of kb_algae ( sometimes all ) were included in protista , later also abandoned in favour of kb_eukaryota . however , as kb_a legacy of the older kb_plant kb_life_(magazine) scheme , some kb_group_(mathematics) that were also treated as protozoans in the kb_past still have duplicated kb_biological_classification ( kb_episcopal_see ambiregnal protists ) .some kb_parasitic kb_algae ( e.g. , the kb_green_algae `` kb_prototheca '' and `` kb_helicosporidium '' , kb_parasites of metazoans , or `` kb_cephaleuros '' , kb_parasites of plants ) were originally classified as kb_fungi , sporozoans , or protistans of `` kb_incertae_sedis sedis '' , while others ( e.g. , the kb_green_algae `` kb_phyllosiphon '' and `` kb_rhodochytrium '' , kb_parasites of plants , or the kb_red_fox kb_algae `` kb_pterocladiophila '' and `` kb_gelidiocolax_mammillatus mammillatus '' , kb_parasites of kb_other_(philosophy) kb_red_fox kb_algae , or the dinoflagellates `` kb_oodinium '' , kb_parasites of kb_fish ) had their relationship with kb_algae conjectured early . in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_noun_case , some kb_group_(mathematics) were originally characterized as kb_parasitic kb_algae ( e.g. , `` kb_chlorochytrium '' ) , but later were seen as kb_endophytic kb_algae . some filamentous kb_bacteria ( e.g. , `` kb_beggiatoa '' ) were originally seen as kb_algae . furthermore , kb_group_(mathematics) like the kb_apicomplexans are also kb_parasites kb_derived_trait from ancestors that possessed plastids , but are not included in any kb_group_(periodic_table) traditionally seen as kb_algae .the kb_first_trimester kb_embryophyte probably kb_evolution_of_tetrapods from shallow kb_freshwater kb_charophyte kb_algae much like `` kb_chara_(alga) '' almost 500 million years ago . these probably had an kb_isomorphic kb_alternation_of_generations of generationskb_a range of algal kb_morphology_(biology) is exhibited , and kb_convergent_evolution of features in unrelated kb_group_(mathematics) is common . the only kb_group_(mathematics) to exhibit three-dimensional kb_multicellular kb_thallus are the kb_red_algae and kb_brown_algae , and some kb_chlorophyta . apical growth is constrained to subsets of these kb_group_(mathematics) : the kb_florideophyceae kb_red_algae , various kb_brown_algae , and the charophytes . the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of charophytes is quite different from those of kb_red_algae and kb_brown_algae , because they have distinct nodes , separated by internode 'stems ' ; whorls of kb_branches_of_science reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes . conceptacles are another kb_polyphyletic kb_trait_theory ; they appear in the kb_coralline_algae kb_algae and the kb_hildenbrandiales , as kb_water_well as the kb_brown_algae .most of the simpler kb_algae are kb_unicellular_organism flagellates or amoeboids , but kb_colonialism and nonmotile kb_theory_of_forms have kb_adaptation independently among several of the kb_group_(mathematics) . some of the more common organizational levels , more than kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of which may occur in the kb_biological_life_cycle of kb_a kb_species , arein kb_triliteral lines , even higher levels of organization have been reached , with full kb_tissue_(biology) kb_planetary_differentiation . these are the kb_robert_brown_(scottish_botanist_from_montrose) kb_algae , —some of which may reach 50 kb_mole_(unit) in kb_length ( kelps ) —the kb_red_fox kb_algae , and the kb_green_algae . the most kb_complex_number kb_theory_of_forms are found among the kb_charophyte kb_algae ( kb_episcopal_see kb_charales and kb_charophyta ) , in kb_a lineage that eventually kb_light-emitting_diode to the higher kb_embryophyte . the kb_list_of_azerbaijani_inventions_and_discoveries that defines these nonalgal plants is the presence of female reproductive kb_organ_(anatomy) with protective kb_cell_(biology) layers that protect the kb_zygote and developing kb_embryo . hence , the kb_embryophyte are referred to as the embryophytes .many kb_algae , particularly members of the kb_characeae , have served as kb_rutherford_model experimental organisms to kb_natural_language_understanding the mechanisms of the kb_water permeability of membranes , kb_osmoregulation , kb_turgor_regulation regulation , kb_salt_tolerance , kb_cytoplasmic_streaming streaming , and the generation of kb_action_potentials potentials .phytohormones are found not only in kb_higher_plants plants , but in kb_algae , too .some kb_species of kb_algae kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_symbiosis

'' the kb_fungi , or mycobionts , are mainly from the kb_ascomycota with kb_a few from the kb_basidiomycota . in kb_nature they do not occur separate from lichens . kb_it is unknown when they began to associate . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont kb_species , rarely kb_2_(number) , from the kb_green_algae , except that alternatively , the mycobiont may associate with kb_a kb_species of kb_cyanobacteria ( hence `` photobiont '' is the more accurate kb_terminology ) . kb_a photobiont may kb_beryllium associated with many different mycobionts or may live independently ; accordingly , lichens are kb_english_alphabet#letter_names and classified as fungal kb_species . the kb_continental_association is termed kb_a kb_morphogenesis because the kb_lichen has kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism and capabilities not possessed by the kb_symbiont kb_species alone ( they can kb_beryllium experimentally kb_isolationism ) . the photobiont possibly triggers otherwise latent kb_gene in the mycobiont .kb_trentepohlia_(alga) is an example of kb_a common kb_green_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) alga kb_genus worldwide that can grow on its own or kb_beryllium lichenised . kb_lichen thus share some of the kb_habitat and often similar kb_appearance_(philosophy) with specialized kb_species of kb_algae ( `` aerophytes kb_coral reefs are accumulated from the kb_calcareous exoskeletons of kb_ocean invertebrates of the kb_order_(biology) kb_scleractinia ( stony corals ) . these kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing kb_metabolism kb_sugar and kb_oxygen to obtain kb_energy_industry for their cell-building processes , including kb_secretion of the kb_exoskeleton , with kb_water and kb_carbon_dioxide as byproducts . dinoflagellates ( algal protists ) are often endosymbionts in the kb_cell_(biology) of the coral-forming kb_ocean invertebrates , where they accelerate host-cell kb_metabolism by generating kb_sugar and kb_oxygen immediately kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance through kb_photosynthesis using kb_daigo_fukuryū_maru kb_light and the kb_carbon_dioxide produced by the host . reef-building stony corals ( hermatypic corals ) require kb_endosymbiotic_theory kb_algae from the kb_genus `` kb_symbiodinium '' to kb_beryllium in kb_a healthy condition . the loss of `` kb_symbiodinium '' from the host is known as kb_coral_bleaching , kb_a condition which leads to the deterioration of kb_a kb_reef .endosymbiontic kb_green_algae live close to the kb_surface_(topology) of some sponges , for example , breadcrumb sponges ( `` kb_halichondria_panicea panicea '' ) . the alga is thus protected from kb_predation ; the kb_sponge is provided with kb_oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80 % of kb_sponge growth in some kb_species .kb_rhodophyta , kb_chlorophyta , and kb_heterokontophyta , the kb_triliteral main algal kb_division_(sport) , have lifecycles which show considerable variation and complexity . in kb_general_(united_states) , an kb_asexual_reproduction kb_phase_(matter) exists where the kb_seaweed 's kb_cell_(biology) are kb_diploid , kb_a sexual kb_phase_(matter) where the kb_cell_(biology) are kb_haploid , followed by fusion of the kb_male and female gametes . kb_asexual_reproduction kb_biological_reproduction permits efficient kb_population increases , but less variation is possible . commonly , in kb_sexual_reproduction kb_biological_reproduction of kb_unicellular_organism and kb_colonialism kb_algae , kb_2_(number) specialized , sexually compatible , kb_haploid gametes make kb_health contact and fuse to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_zygotethe `` algal kb_class_(set_theory) of the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) national herbarium '' ( located in the national kb_museum of kb_natural_number kb_history ) consists of approximately 320,500 dried specimens , which , although not exhaustive ( no exhaustive kb_class_(set_theory) exists ) , gives an idea of the kb_order_of_magnitude kb_apparent_magnitude of the kb_grammatical_number of algal kb_species ( that kb_grammatical_number remains unknown ) . estimates vary widely . for example , according to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) standard textbook , in the kb_british_isles the `` kb_united_kingdom kb_biodiversity steering kb_group_(periodic_table) report '' estimated there to kb_beryllium 20,000 algal kb_species in the kb_united_kingdom . another checklist reports only about 5,000 kb_species . regarding the difference of about 15,000 kb_species , the text concludes : `` kb_it kb_will_and_testament require many detailed field surveys before kb_it is possible to provide kb_a reliable estimate of the total kb_grammatical_number of kb_species ...

these kb_grammatical_number have no more credibility than the kb_kingdom_of_great_britain ones mentioned above . most estimates also omit kb_microscopic_scale kb_algae , such as kb_phytoplankton .the most recent estimate suggests 72,500 algal kb_species worldwide .the distribution of algal kb_species has been fairly kb_water_well studied since the founding of kb_phytogeography in the mid-19th century . kb_algae kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of plantae by seeds and spores . this dispersal can kb_beryllium accomplished by

kb_air_(classical_element) , kb_soil , and in or on kb_other_(philosophy) organisms . whether kb_a kb_spore is to grow into an kb_organism depends on the combination of the kb_species and the environmental conditions where the kb_spore lands .the spores of kb_freshwater kb_algae are dispersed mainly by running kb_water and kb_wind , as kb_water_well as by living carriers . however , not all bodies of kb_water can carry all kb_species of kb_algae , as the kb_protein_sequencing kb_function_composition of certain kb_water bodies limits the kb_algae that can survive within them . kb_ocean spores are often kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) by kb_oceanus currents . kb_oceanus kb_water presents many vastly different habitats based on kb_temperature and nutrient availability , resulting in phytogeographic zones , kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey , and kb_provinces_of_angola .to some kb_degree_(angle) , the distribution of kb_algae is kb_grammatical_subject to floristic

kb_variancekb_analysis of kb_variance ( anova ) is kb_a kb_class_(set_theory) of kb_statistical_mechanics models and their associated estimation procedures ( such as the `` variation '' among and between kb_group_(mathematics) ) used to analyze the differences among kb_group_(periodic_table) means in kb_a kb_sample_(statistics) . anova was kb_adaptation by kb_statistician and kb_evolutionary_biology biologist kb_ronald_fisher fisher . in the anova setting , the observed kb_variance in kb_a kb_particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation . in its simplest kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , anova provides kb_a kb_statistical_test of whether the kb_population means of several kb_group_(mathematics) are equal , and therefore generalizes the `` t '' -test to more than kb_2_(number) kb_group_(mathematics) . anova is useful for comparing ( testing ) kb_triliteral or more kb_group_(periodic_table) means for kb_statistical_significance . kb_it is conceptually similar to kb_multiple_comparisons_problem t-tests , but is more kb_conservative , resulting in fewer kb_type_i_errors kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics , and is therefore suited to kb_a wide range of practical kb_problems_(aristotle) .while the kb_analysis of kb_variance reached fruition in the 20th century , antecedents extend kb_century_(cricket) into the kb_past according to stigler . these include hypothesis testing , the partitioning of sums of kb_square_(algebra) , experimental techniques and the additive kb_rutherford_model . kb_laplace was performing hypothesis testing in the 1770s . the development of least-squares methods by kb_laplace and kb_carl_friedrich_gauss circa 1800 provided an improved method of combining kb_observations_(pierre_belon) ( over the existing practices then used in kb_astronomy and geodesy ) . kb_it also initiated much kb_science of the contributions to sums of kb_square_(algebra) . kb_laplace knew how to estimate kb_a kb_variance from kb_a residual ( rather than kb_a total ) kb_sum_of_squares_(statistics) kb_square_(algebra) . by 1827 , kb_laplace was using kb_least_squares kb_square_(algebra) methods to address anova kb_problems_(aristotle) regarding measurements of atmospheric tides . before 1800 , astronomers had kb_isolationism kb_observational_astronomy kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics resultingfrom reaction times ( the `` kb_personal_equation '' ) and had kb_adaptation methods of kb_redox the kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics . the experimental methods used in the kb_science of the kb_personal_equation were later kb_acceptance#self_acceptance by the emerging field of kb_psychology which kb_adaptation kb_strong_nuclear_force ( full kb_factorial_experiment ) experimental methods to which randomization and kb_blind_experiment were soon added . an eloquent non-mathematical explanation of the additive effects kb_rutherford_model waskb_one-way_analysis_of_variance in 1885 .kb_ronald_fisher fisher introduced the kb_terminology kb_variance and kb_anatolian_hypothesis its formal kb_analysis in kb_a 1918 article `` kb_the_correlation_between_relatives_on_the_supposition_of_mendelian_inheritance correlation between relatives on the supposition of kb_mendelian inheritance '' . kb_histidine kb_first_trimester kb_application_(computing) of the kb_analysis of kb_variance was published in 1921. kb_analysis of kb_variance became widely known after kb_being included in fisher 's 1925 book `` kb_statistical_methods_for_research_workers kb_research workers '' .randomization models were kb_adaptation by several researchers . the kb_first_trimester was published in kb_poland by kb_jerzy_neyman neyman kb_analysis of kb_variance can kb_beryllium used as an exploratory kb_tool to explain kb_observations_(pierre_belon) . kb_a kb_dog show provides an example . kb_a kb_dog show is not kb_a random sampling of the kb_breed : kb_it is typically limited to dogs that are adult , pure-bred , and exemplary . kb_a histogram of kb_dog weights from kb_a show might plausibly kb_beryllium rather kb_complex_number , like the yellow-orange distribution shown in the illustrations . suppose we wanted to predict the weight of kb_a kb_dog based on kb_a certain kb_set_(mythology) of characteristics of each kb_dog . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) way to do that is to `` explain '' the distribution of weights by dividing the kb_dog kb_population into kb_group_(mathematics) based on those characteristics . kb_a successful grouping kb_will_and_testament split dogs such that ( kb_a ) each kb_group_(periodic_table) has kb_a low kb_variance of kb_dog weights ( kb_meaning_(linguistics) the kb_group_(periodic_table) is relatively homogeneous ) and ( kb_riboflavin ) the kb_mean of each kb_group_(periodic_table) is distinct ( if kb_2_(number) kb_group_(mathematics) have the same kb_mean , then kb_it is n't reasonable to conclude that the kb_group_(mathematics) are , in kb_fact , separate in any meaningful way ) .in the illustrations to the kb_right-wing_politics , kb_group_(mathematics) are kb_interpretatio_graeca as `` x '' , `` x '' , etc . in the kb_first_trimester illustration , the dogs are divided according to the kb_decay_product ( kb_interaction ) of kb_2_(number) kb_binary_number groupings : kb_thomas_young_(scientist) vs kb_old_testament , and short-haired vs long-haired ( e.g. , kb_group_(periodic_table) 1 is kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , short-haired dogs , kb_group_(periodic_table) kb_alkaline_earth_metal is kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , long-haired dogs , etc. ) . since the distributions of kb_dog weight within each of the kb_group_(mathematics) ( shown in blue ) has kb_a relatively kb_prespa_lake kb_variance , and since the means are very similar across kb_group_(mathematics) , grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in kb_dog weights : knowing which kb_group_(periodic_table) kb_a kb_dog is in does n't allow kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) to predict its weight much better than simply knowing the kb_dog is in kb_a kb_dog show . thus , this grouping fails to explain the variation in the overall distribution ( yellow-orange ) .an attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as `` pet vs working kb_breed '' and `` less athletic vs more athletic '' would probably kb_beryllium somewhat more successful ( fair fit ) . the heaviest show dogs are likely to kb_beryllium big , kb_strong_nuclear_force , working breeds , while breeds kept as pets tend to kb_beryllium smaller and thus lighter . as shown by the kb_second_language illustration , the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the kb_first_trimester case , and the means are more distinguishable . however , the significant overlap of distributions , for example , means that we can not distinguish `` x '' and `` x '' reliably . grouping dogs according to kb_a kb_coin flip might produce distributions that kb_look_(american_magazine) similar .an attempt to explain weight by kb_breed is likely to produce kb_a very good fit . all chihuahuas are kb_light and all st bernards are heavy . the difference in weights between setters and kb_pointer_(computer_programming) does not justify separate breeds . the kb_analysis of kb_variance provides the formal tools to justify these kb_intuition_(knowledge) judgments . kb_a common use of the method is the kb_analysis of experimental kb_big_data or the development of models . the method has some advantages over correlation : not all of the kb_big_data must kb_beryllium numeric and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) result of the method is kb_a kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition in the kb_confidence_and_supply in an explanatory relationship .anova is kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_statistical_hypothesis_testing testing heavily used in the kb_analysis of experimental kb_big_data . kb_a test result ( calculated from the kb_null_hypothesis and the kb_sample_(statistics) ) is called kb_statistical_physics significant if kb_it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance , `` assuming the kb_truth of the kb_null_hypothesis '' . kb_a kb_statistical_physics significant result , when kb_a kb_probability ( `` p '' -value ) is less than kb_a pre-specified kb_threshold_potential ( kb_statistical_significance ) , justifies the rejection of the kb_null_hypothesis , but only if the kb_a_priori_and_a_posteriori kb_probability of the kb_null_hypothesis is not kb_high_middle_ages .in the typical kb_application_(computing) of anova , the kb_null_hypothesis is that all kb_group_(mathematics) are random samples from the same kb_population . for example , when studying the effect of different treatments on similar samples of patients , the kb_null_hypothesis would kb_beryllium that all treatments have the same effect ( perhaps kb_none_(liturgy) ) . rejecting the kb_null_hypothesis is taken to kb_mean that the differences in observed effects between treatment kb_group_(mathematics) are unlikely to kb_beryllium due to random chance .by kb_construction , hypothesis testing limits the rate of kb_type_i_errors kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics ( false positives ) to kb_a kb_statistical_significance . experimenters also wish to kb_limit_(mathematics) kb_type_ii_errors kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics ( false negatives ) .the rate of kb_type_ii_errors kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics depends largely on kb_sample_(statistics) size ( the rate is larger for smaller samples ) , kb_importancelevel ( when the standard of proof is kb_high_middle_ages , the chances of overlookingkb_a discovery are also kb_high_middle_ages ) and kb_effect_size size ( kb_a smaller kb_effect_size size is more prone to kb_type_(biology) ii kb_error ) .the terminology of anova is largely from the kb_statistical_mechanicskb_design_of_experiments of experiments . the experimenter adjusts factors andmeasures responses in an attempt to determine an effect . factors areassigned to experimental units by kb_a combination of randomization andkb_randomized_block_design to ensure the kb_validity_(logic) of the results . kb_blind_experiment keeps theweighing impartial . responses show kb_a variability that is partiallythe result of the effect and is partially random kb_error .anova is the synthesis of several kb_idea and kb_it is used for kb_cross-platform_softwarepurposes . as kb_a consequence , kb_it is difficult to define concisely or precisely .`` kb_classical_conditioning '' anova for balanced kb_big_data does kb_triliteral things at once :in short , anova is kb_a kb_statistical_mechanics kb_tool used in several ways to develop and confirm an explanation for the observed kb_big_data .additionally :as kb_a result :anova `` has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) enjoyed the status of kb_being the most used ( some wouldsay abused ) kb_statistical_mechanics technique in kb_psychology kb_research . ''anova `` is probably the most useful technique in the field ofkb_statistical_mechanics inference . ''anova is difficult to teach , particularly for kb_complex_number experiments , with kb_restricted_randomization designs kb_being kb_notorious_(1946_film) . in some kb_noun_case the properkb_application_(computing) of the method is best determined by problem kb_pattern_recognitionfollowed by the consultation of kb_a classic authoritative test .( condensed from the `` kb_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology kb_engineering kb_statistics handbook '' : kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) 5.7. kb_aglossary of doe terminology . )there are kb_triliteral classes of models used in the kb_analysis of kb_variance , and these are outlined here .the fixed-effects kb_rutherford_model ( kb_class_(biology) kb_iodine ) of kb_analysis of kb_variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or more treatments to the kb_british_subject of the kb_experiment to kb_episcopal_see whether the kb_response_variable variable values change . this allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of kb_response_variable variable values that the treatment would generate in the kb_population as kb_a whole .random-effects kb_rutherford_model ( kb_class_(biology) ii ) is used when the treatments are not fixed . this occurs when the various kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors levels are sampled from kb_a larger kb_population . because the levels themselves are random kb_variable_(mathematics) , some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments ( kb_a multi-variable generalization of kb_simple_polygon differences ) differ from the fixed-effects kb_rutherford_model .kb_a mixed-effects kb_rutherford_model ( kb_class_(biology) iii ) contains experimental factors of both fixed and random-effects types , with appropriately different interpretations and kb_analysis for the kb_2_(number) types .example :teaching experiments could kb_beryllium performed by kb_a kb_college or kb_aarhus_university kb_departments_of_franceto find kb_a good introductory textbook , with each text considered kb_atreatment . the fixed-effects kb_rutherford_model would compare kb_a kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of candidatekb_literature . the random-effects kb_rutherford_model would determine whether importantdifferences exist among kb_a kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of randomly selected kb_literature . themixed-effects kb_rutherford_model would compare the ( fixed ) incumbent kb_literature torandomly selected alternatives .kb_definable_set fixed and random effects has proven elusive , with competingdefinitions arguably leading toward kb_a kb_linguistic_anthropology quagmire .the kb_analysis of kb_variance has been studied from several approaches , the most common of which uses kb_a kb_linear_model that relates the response to the treatments and kb_periodic_table_block . note that the kb_rutherford_model is kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history in parameters but may kb_beryllium nonlinear across kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors levels . kb_interpretation_(logic) is easy when kb_big_data is balanced across factors but much deeper understanding is needed for unbalanced kb_big_data .the kb_analysis of kb_variance can kb_beryllium presented in terms of kb_a kb_linear_model , which makes the following assumptions about the kb_probability_distribution of the responses :the separate assumptions of the textbook kb_rutherford_model imply that the kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics are independently , identically , and normally distributed for fixed effects models , that is , that the kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics ( formula_1 ) are independent andin kb_a kb_randomized_controlled_trial controlled kb_experiment , the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units , following the experimental protocol . this randomization is objective and declared before the kb_experiment is carried out . the objective random-assignment is used to test the kb_importance of the kb_null_hypothesis , following the kb_idea of kb_charles_sanders_peirce peirce and kb_ronald_fisher fisher . this design-based kb_analysis was discussed and kb_adaptation by kb_francis_j._anscombe j. anscombe at kb_rothamsted_experimental_station experimental station and by kb_oscar_kempthorne at kb_iowa_state_university kb_aarhus_university . kempthorne and kb_histidine students make an assumption of `` kb_units_of_measurement treatment additivity '' , which is discussed in the books of kempthorne and kb_david_r._cox cox .in its simplest kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , the assumption of unit-treatment additivity kb_sovereign_state that the observed response formula_3 from experimental kb_units_of_measurement formula_4 when receiving treatment formula_5 can kb_beryllium written as the kb_addition of the kb_units_of_measurement 's response formula_6 and the treatment-effect formula_7 , that isthe assumption of unit-treatment additivity implies that , for every treatment formula_5 , the formula_5th treatment has exactly the same effect formula_11 on every kb_experiment kb_units_of_measurement .the assumption of kb_units_of_measurement treatment additivity usually can not kb_beryllium directly kb_falsifiability , according to cox and kempthorne . however , many `` consequences '' of treatment-unit additivity can kb_beryllium kb_falsifiability . for kb_a randomized kb_experiment , the assumption of unit-treatment additivity `` implies '' that the kb_variance is constant for all treatments . therefore , by kb_contraposition , kb_a necessary condition for unit-treatment additivity is that the kb_variance is constant .the use of kb_units_of_measurement treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design-based inference that is standard in finite-population kb_survey_sampling .kempthorne uses the randomization-distribution and the assumption of `` kb_units_of_measurement treatment additivity '' to produce kb_a `` kb_derived_trait kb_linear_model '' , very similar to the textbook kb_rutherford_model discussed previously . the test kb_statistics of this kb_derived_trait kb_linear_model are closely approximated by the test kb_statistics of an appropriate normal kb_linear_model , according to approximation theorems and kb_simulation studies . however , there are differences . for example , the randomization-based kb_analysis results in kb_a small but ( strictly ) kb_negative_number correlation between the kb_observations_(pierre_belon) . in the randomization-based kb_analysis , there is `` no assumption '' of kb_a `` normal '' distribution and certainly `` no assumption '' of `` kb_independence '' . on the contrary , `` the kb_observations_(pierre_belon) are dependent '' !the randomization-based kb_analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious kb_algebra_over_a_field and extensive kb_time_(magazine) . since the randomization-based kb_analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using kb_a normal kb_linear_model , most kb_teachers emphasize the normal kb_linear_model approach . few statisticians kb_space_debris to model-based kb_analysis of balanced randomized experiments .however , when kb_applied_science to kb_big_data from non-randomized experiments or kb_observational_study , model-based kb_analysis lacks the warrant of randomization . for kb_observational_astronomy kb_big_data , the derivation of kb_confidence_and_supply intervals must use `` subjective '' models , as emphasized by kb_ronald_fisher fisher and kb_histidine followers . in practice , the estimates of treatment-effects from kb_observational_study generally are often inconsistent . in practice , `` kb_statistical_mechanics models '' and kb_observational_astronomy kb_big_data are useful for suggesting kb_hypothesis that should kb_beryllium treated very cautiously by the kb_state_school .the normal-model based anova kb_analysis assumes the kb_independence , normality andhomogeneity of variances of the residuals . therandomization-based kb_analysis assumes only the homogeneity of thevariances of the residuals ( as kb_a consequence of unit-treatmentadditivity ) and uses the randomization procedure of the kb_experiment .both these analyses require kb_homoscedasticity , as an assumption for the normal-model kb_analysis and as kb_a consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomization-based kb_analysis .however , studies of processes thatchange variances rather than means ( called kb_dispersion_(optics) effects ) havebeen successfully conducted using anova . there are`` no '' necessary assumptions for anova in its full generality , but the`` kb_fluorine '' -test used for anova hypothesis testing has assumptions and practicallimitations which are of continuing kb_interest .kb_problems_(aristotle) which do not satisfy the assumptions of anova can often kb_beryllium transformed to satisfy the assumptions .the kb_property of unit-treatment additivity is not kb_invariant_(mathematics) under kb_a `` change of scale '' , kb_sulfate statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit-treatment additivity . if the kb_response_variable variable is expected to follow kb_a parametric kb_family_(biology) of kb_probability distributions , then the kb_statistician may specify ( in the protocol for the kb_experiment or kb_observational_study ) that the responses kb_beryllium transformed to stabilize the kb_variance . also , kb_a kb_statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms kb_beryllium kb_applied_science to the responses , which are believed to follow kb_a multiplicative kb_rutherford_model .according to kb_augustin-louis_cauchy 's kb_functional_equation equation kb_theorem , the kb_logarithm is the only kb_continuous_function transformation that transforms real kb_multiplication to kb_addition .anova is used in the kb_analysis of comparative experiments , those inwhich only the difference in outcomes is of kb_interest . the kb_statistical_mechanicskb_importance of the kb_experiment is determined by kb_a kb_ratio of kb_2_(number)variances . this kb_ratio is independent of several possible alterationsto the experimental kb_observations_(pierre_belon) : adding kb_a constant to allkb_observations_(pierre_belon) does not alter kb_importance . multiplying allkb_observations_(pierre_belon) by kb_a constant does not alter kb_importance . kb_sulfate anovakb_statistical_significance result is independent of constant bias andkb_fouling kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics as kb_water_well as the units used in expressing kb_observations_(pierre_belon) .in the era of kb_mechanics kb_calculation kb_it was common tosubtract kb_a constant from all kb_observations_(pierre_belon) ( when kb_cognate todropping leading digits ) to simplify kb_big_data kb_azerbaijan_in_the_eurovision_song_contest_2009 . this is an example of kb_big_datakb_coding_(social_sciences) .the calculations of anova can kb_beryllium characterized as kb_computing kb_a kb_grammatical_numberof means and variances , dividing kb_2_(number) variances and comparing the kb_ratioto kb_a handbook kb_lightness to determine kb_statistical_significance . calculatingkb_a treatment effect is then trivial , `` the effect of any treatment isestimated by taking the difference between the kb_mean of thekb_observations_(pierre_belon) which receive the treatment and the kb_general_(united_states) kb_mean '' .anova uses traditional standardized terminology . the definitionalequation of kb_sample_(statistics) kb_variance isformula_12 , where thedivisor is called the kb_degrees_of_freedom_(statistics) kb_freedom ( df ) , the kb_summation is calledthe kb_sum_of_squares_(statistics) kb_square_(algebra) ( kb_schutzstaffel ) , the result is called the kb_mean kb_square ( ms ) andthe squared terms are deviations from the kb_sample_(statistics) kb_mean . anovaestimates 3 kb_sample_(statistics) variances : kb_a total kb_variance based on all thekb_observation deviations from the grand kb_mean , an kb_error kb_variance based onall the kb_observation deviations from their appropriatetreatment means , and kb_a treatment kb_variance . the treatment kb_variance isbased on the deviations of treatment means from the grand kb_mean , theresult kb_being multiplied by the kb_grammatical_number of kb_observations_(pierre_belon) in eachtreatment to account for the difference between the kb_variance ofkb_observations_(pierre_belon) and the kb_variance of means .the fundamental technique is kb_a partitioning of the total kb_sum_of_squares_(statistics) kb_square_(algebra) `` kb_schutzstaffel '' into components related to the effects used in the kb_rutherford_model . for example , the kb_rutherford_model for kb_a simplified anova with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_type_(biology) of treatment at different levels .the kb_grammatical_number of kb_degrees_of_freedom_(statistics) kb_freedom `` df '' can kb_beryllium partitioned in kb_a similar way : kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of these components ( that for kb_error ) specifies kb_a kb_chi-squared_distribution distribution which describes the associated kb_sum_of_squares_(statistics) kb_square_(algebra) , while the same is kb_truth for `` treatments '' if there is no treatment effect .kb_episcopal_see also kb_lack-of-fit_sum_of_squares kb_sum_of_squares_(statistics) kb_square_(algebra) .the `` kb_fluorine '' -test is used for comparing the factors of the total deviation . for example , in one-way , or single-factor anova , kb_statistical_significance is tested for by comparing the kb_fluorine test statisticwhere `` ms '' is kb_mean kb_square , formula_17 = kb_grammatical_number of treatments andformula_18 = total kb_grammatical_number of kb_noun_caseto the `` kb_fluorine '' -distribution with formula_19 , formula_20 kb_degrees_of_freedom_(statistics) kb_freedom . using the `` kb_fluorine '' -distribution is kb_a kb_natural_number candidate because the test statistic is the kb_ratio of kb_2_(number) kb_image_scaling sums of kb_square_(algebra) each of which follows kb_a kb_image_scaling kb_chi-squared_distribution distribution .the expected kb_lightness of kb_fluorine is formula_21 ( where kb_neutron is the treatment kb_sample_(statistics) size )which is 1 for no treatment effect . as values of kb_fluorine increase above 1 , the kb_evidence_(law) is increasingly inconsistent with the kb_null_hypothesis . kb_2_(number) apparent experimental methods of increasing kb_fluorine are increasing the kb_sample_(statistics) size and kb_redox the kb_error kb_variance by tight experimental controls .there are kb_2_(number) methods of concluding the anova hypothesis test , both of which produce the same result :the anova `` kb_fluorine '' -test is known to kb_beryllium nearly optimal in the kb_word_sense of minimizing false kb_negative_number kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics for kb_a fixed rate of kb_false_positive kb_positive_number kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics ( i.e . maximizing kb_power_(physics) for kb_a fixed kb_statistical_significance ) . for example , to test the hypothesis that various kb_medical_abortion treatments have exactly the same effect , the `` kb_fluorine '' -test 's `` p '' -values closely approximate the kb_permutation_test test 's p-values : the approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced . such permutation tests characterize kb_uniformly_most_powerful_test with maximum kb_power_(physics) against all kb_alternative_hypothesis kb_hypothesis , as observed by rosenbaum . the anova `` kb_fluorine '' -test ( of the null-hypothesis that all treatments have exactly

kb_de_jure distinct from the alkanes , this kb_class_(biology) of kb_hydrocarbons is referred to by some as the `` cyclic alkanes . '' as their description implies , they contain kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or more kb_ring_(mathematics) .kb_simple_polygon cycloalkanes have kb_a kb_prefix `` cyclo- '' to distinguish them from alkanes . cycloalkanes are kb_english_alphabet#letter_names as per their kb_open-chain_compound counterparts with respect to the kb_grammatical_number of kb_carbon atoms in their backbones , e.g. , kb_cyclopentane ( ch ) is kb_a kb_cycloalkane with 5 kb_carbon atoms just like kb_pentane ( ch ) , but they are joined up in kb_a five-membered kb_ring_(mathematics) . in kb_a similar manner , kb_propane and kb_cyclopropane , kb_butane and kb_cyclobutane , etc .substituted cycloalkanes are kb_english_alphabet#letter_names similarly to substituted alkanes — the kb_cycloalkane kb_ring_(mathematics) is stated , and the kb_substituents are according to their kb_positional_notation on the kb_ring_(mathematics) , with the numbering decided by the kb_cahn–ingold–prelog_priority_rules priority kb_biological_rules .the trivial ( non-systematic ) kb_toponymy for alkanes is 'paraffins ' . together , alkanes are known as the 'paraffin series ' . trivial names for kb_chemical_compound are usually historical kb_artifact_(archaeology) . they were kb_neologism before the development of kb_iupac_nomenclature names , and have been retained due to familiar usage in kb_industry . cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes .kb_it is almost certain that the kb_terminology 'paraffin ' stems from the kb_petrochemical_industry . branched-chain alkanes are called isoparaffins . the use of the kb_terminology `` paraffin '' is kb_a kb_general_(united_states) kb_terminology and often does not distinguish between pure kb_chemical_compound and mixtures of isomers , i.e. , kb_chemical_compound of the same kb_chemical_formula , e.g. , kb_pentane and kb_isopentanealkanes experience kb_intermolecular van der waals kb_afsharid_dynasty . stronger kb_intermolecular van der waals kb_afsharid_dynasty give rise to greater kb_boiling_points points of alkanes .there are kb_2_(number) determinants for the kb_strength_of_materials of the van der waals kb_afsharid_dynasty :under kb_standard_conditions conditions , from ch to ch alkanes are gaseous ; from ch to ch they are liquids ; and after ch they are solids . as the kb_boiling_point point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight , kb_it should not kb_beryllium kb_a surprise that the kb_boiling_point point has almost kb_a kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history relationship with the size ( kb_molecular_weight ) of the kb_molecule . as kb_a kb_rule_of_thumb of thumb , the kb_boiling_point point kb_ice_rise 20–30 °c for each kb_carbon added to the chain ; this rule applies to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_homologous_series .kb_a straight-chain kb_alkane kb_will_and_testament have kb_a kb_boiling_point point higher than kb_a branched-chain kb_alkane due to the greater kb_surface_area in contact , thus the greater van der waals kb_afsharid_dynasty , between adjacent molecules . for example , compare kb_isobutane ( 2-methylpropane ) and kb_n-butane ( kb_butane ) , which kb_boil at −12 and 0 °c , and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which kb_boil at 50 and 58 °c , respectively . for the latter case , kb_2_(number) molecules 2,3-dimethylbutane can `` lock '' into each kb_other_(philosophy) better than the cross-shaped 2,2-dimethylbutane , hence the greater van der waals kb_afsharid_dynasty .on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , cycloalkanes tend to have higher kb_boiling_points points than their kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules , which give kb_a kb_plane_(geometry) of kb_intermolecular contact .the kb_melting_point points of the alkanes follow kb_a similar trend to kb_boiling_points points for the same kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving as outlined above . that is , ( all kb_other_(philosophy) things kb_being equal ) the larger the kb_molecule the higher the kb_melting_point . there is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) significant difference between kb_boiling_points points and kb_melting_point points . solids have more kb_rigid_airship and fixed kb_structure than liquids . this kb_rigid_airship kb_structure requires kb_energy_industry to break down . thus the better put together kb_solid kb_structural_analysis kb_will_and_testament require more kb_energy_industry to break apart . for alkanes , this can kb_beryllium seen from the graph above ( i.e. , the blue kb_line_(geometry) ) . the odd-numbered alkanes have kb_a lower trend in kb_melting_point points than even numbered alkanes . this is because even numbered alkanes pack kb_water_well in the kb_solid kb_phase_(matter) , forming kb_a well-organized kb_structure , which requires more kb_energy_industry to break apart . the odd-numbered alkanes pack less kb_water_well and kb_sulfate the `` looser '' organized kb_solid packing kb_structure requires less kb_energy_industry to break apart .the kb_melting_point points of branched-chain alkanes can kb_beryllium either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes , again depending on the ability of the kb_alkane in kb_question to pack kb_water_well in the kb_solid kb_phase_(matter) : this is particularly kb_truth for kb_isoalkanes ( 2-methyl isomers ) , which often have kb_melting_point points higher than those of the kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history analogues .alkanes do not conduct electricity in any way , nor are they substantially kb_relative_static_permittivity by an kb_electric_field field . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , they do not kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_hydrogen bonds and are kb_insoluble in kb_polar_molecule solvents such as kb_water . since the kb_hydrogen bonds between kb_individual kb_water molecules are aligned away from an kb_alkane kb_molecule , the coexistence of an kb_alkane and kb_water leads to an increase in kb_molecular_genetics kb_order_(biology) ( kb_a kb_redox in kb_entropy ) . as there is no significant kb_chemical_bond between kb_water molecules and kb_alkane molecules , the kb_second_law_of_thermodynamics of kb_thermodynamics suggests that this kb_redox in kb_entropy should kb_beryllium minimized by minimizing the contact between kb_alkane and kb_water : alkanes are said to kb_beryllium kb_hydrophobe in that they repel kb_water .their kb_solubility in kb_nonpolar solvents is relatively good , kb_a kb_property that is called kb_lipophilicitythe kb_molecular_genetics kb_structure of the alkanes directly kb_affect_(psychology) their kb_health and kb_protein_sequencing characteristics . kb_it is kb_derived_trait from the kb_electron_configuration of kb_carbon , which has four valence electrons . the kb_carbon atoms in alkanes are always kb_orbital_hybridization , that is to say that the valence electrons are said to kb_beryllium in four kb_cognate orbitals kb_derived_trait from the combination of the 2s kb_atomic_orbital and the kb_triliteral 2p orbitals . these orbitals , which have kb_identical_particles energies , are arranged spatially in the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_a kb_tetrahedron , the kb_angle of cos ( − ) ≈ 109.47° between them .an kb_alkane kb_molecule has only kb_c–h_bond and c–c kb_single_bond bonds . the former result from the overlap of an sp kb_atomic_orbital of kb_carbon with the 1s kb_atomic_orbital of kb_a kb_hydrogen ; the latter by the overlap of kb_2_(number) sp orbitals on different kb_carbon atoms . the kb_chemical_bond lengthsthe spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp orbitals—they are tetrahedrally arranged , with an kb_angle of 109.47° between them . kb_structural_engineer formulae that represent the bonds as kb_being at kb_right-wing_politics angles to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) another , while both common and useful , do not correspond with the kb_reality .the kb_structural_engineer kb_chemical_formula and the kb_chemical_bond angles are not usually sufficient to completely describe the kb_geometry of kb_a kb_molecule . there is kb_a further kb_degree_(angle) of kb_freedom for each kb_carbon–carbon_bond kb_chemical_bond : the kb_torsion_angle between the atoms or kb_group_(mathematics) kb_bound_morpheme to the atoms at each end of the kb_chemical_bond . the spatial arrangement described by the kb_torsion_tensor angles of the kb_molecule is known as its kb_conformational_isomerismkb_ethane kb_theory_of_forms the simplest case for studying the kb_conformational_isomerism of alkanes , as there is only kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) c–c kb_chemical_bond . if kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) looks down the kb_axis_powers of the c–c kb_chemical_bond , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_will_and_testament kb_episcopal_see the so-called kb_newman_projection projection . the kb_hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear kb_carbon atoms have an kb_angle of 120° between them , resulting from the projection of the kb_base_(chemistry) of the kb_tetrahedron onto kb_a flat kb_plane_(geometry) . however , the kb_torsion_angle between kb_a given kb_hydrogen_atom attached to the front kb_carbon and kb_a given kb_hydrogen_atom attached to the rear kb_carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360° . this is kb_a consequence of the free kb_rotation_(mathematics) about kb_a carbon–carbon kb_single_bond . despite this apparent kb_freedom , only kb_2_(number) limiting conformations are important : kb_eclipsed kb_conformational_isomerism and kb_staggered_conformation kb_conformational_isomerism .the kb_2_(number) conformations , also known as rotamers , differ in kb_energy_industry : the kb_staggered_conformation kb_conformational_isomerism is 12.6 kb_kilojoule_per_mole lower in kb_energy_industry ( more stable ) than the kb_eclipsed kb_conformational_isomerism ( the least stable ) .this difference in kb_energy_industry between the kb_2_(number) conformations , known as the kb_torsion_energy , is low compared to the kb_thermal_conductivity kb_energy_industry of an kb_ethane kb_molecule at ambient kb_temperature . there is constant kb_rotation_(mathematics) about the c–c kb_chemical_bond . the kb_time_(magazine) taken for an kb_ethane kb_molecule to pass from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_staggered_conformation kb_conformational_isomerism to the kb_next , kb_cognate to the kb_rotation_(mathematics) of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) ch kb_group_(periodic_table) by 120° relative to the kb_other_(philosophy) , is of the kb_order_(biology) of 10 seconds .the case of kb_higher_alkanes alkanes is more kb_complex_number but based on similar principles , with the antiperiplanar kb_conformational_isomerism always kb_being the most favored around each kb_carbon–carbon_bond kb_chemical_bond . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , alkanes are usually shown in kb_a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models . the actual kb_structure kb_will_and_testament always differ somewhat from these idealized kb_theory_of_forms , as the differences in kb_energy_industry between the conformations are small compared to the kb_thermal_conductivity kb_energy_industry of the molecules : kb_alkane molecules have no fixed kb_structural_engineer kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , whatever the models may suggest .virtually all kb_organic_compounds contain carbon–carbon , and carbon–hydrogen bonds , and kb_sulfate show some of the features of alkanes in their kb_emission_spectrum . alkanes are notable for having no kb_other_(philosophy) kb_group_(mathematics) , and therefore for the `` absence '' of kb_other_(philosophy) kb_characteristic_(algebra) kb_spectroscopy features of kb_a different kb_functional_group kb_group_(periodic_table) like kb_alcohol_(chemistry) , kb_aldehyde , kb_carboxylic_acid etc .the carbon–hydrogen kb_stretching kb_musical_mode gives kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force absorption between 2850 and 2960 kb_wavenumber , while the carbon–carbon kb_stretching kb_musical_mode absorbs between 800 and 1300 kb_wavenumber . the carbon–hydrogen bending modes depend on the kb_nature of the kb_group_(periodic_table) : kb_methyl_group kb_group_(mathematics) show bands at 1450 kb_wavenumber and 1375 kb_wavenumber , while methylene kb_group_(mathematics) show bands at 1465 kb_wavenumber and 1450 kb_wavenumber . kb_carbon chains with more than four kb_carbon atoms show kb_a weak absorption at around 725 kb_wavenumber .the kb_proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at `` δ '' = 0.5–1.5 . the carbon-13 resonances depend on the kb_grammatical_number of kb_hydrogen atoms attached to the kb_carbon : `` δ '' = 8–30 ( kb_primary_education , kb_methyl_group , –ch ) , 15–55 ( kb_secondary_school , methylene , –ch– ) , 20–60 ( kb_tertiary_healthcare , methyne , kb_c–h_bond ) and quaternary . the carbon-13 kb_resonance of quaternary kb_carbon atoms is characteristically weak , due to the lack of kb_nuclear_overhauser_effect overhauser effect and the kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_relaxation_time , and can kb_beryllium missed in weak samples , or samples that have not been run for kb_a sufficiently kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_time_(magazine) .alkanes have kb_a kb_high_middle_ages kb_ionization_energy , and the kb_molecular_genetics kb_ion is usually weak . the fragmentation kb_pattern can kb_beryllium difficult to interpret , but , in the case of branched chain alkanes , the kb_carbon_chain is preferentially cleaved at kb_tertiary_healthcare or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals . the fragment resulting from the loss of kb_a kb_single_bond kb_methyl_group ( `` kb_mole_(unit) '' − 15 ) is often absent , and kb_other_(philosophy) fragments are often spaced by intervals of fourteen kb_mass_(liturgy) units , corresponding to sequential loss of ch kb_group_(mathematics) .alkanes are only weakly kb_reactivity_(chemistry) with kb_ionic_crystal and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_polar_molecule substances . the kb_acid_dissociation_constant constant ( kb_pka ) values of all alkanes are above 60 , hence they are practically kb_inert_gas to acids and kb_base_(chemistry) ( kb_episcopal_see : kb_carbon acids ) . this inertness is the source of the kb_terminology `` paraffins '' ( with the kb_meaning_(linguistics) here of `` lacking affinity '' ) . in kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil the kb_alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years .however kb_redox reactions of alkanes , in kb_particular with kb_oxygen and the halogens , are possible as the kb_carbon atoms are in kb_a strongly kb_redox condition ; in the case of kb_methane , the lowest possible kb_oxidation_state for kb_carbon ( −4 ) is reached . reaction with kb_oxygen ( `` if '' present in sufficient kb_quantity to satisfy the reaction kb_stoichiometry ) leads to kb_combustion without any smoke , producing kb_carbon_dioxide and kb_water . kb_free_radical_halogenation halogenation reactions occur with halogens , leading to the production of kb_haloalkanes . in kb_addition , alkanes have been shown to interact with , and bind to , certain kb_transition_metal complexes in kb_carbon-hydrogen_bond_activation activation .free radicals , molecules with unpaired electrons , play kb_a kb_prespa_lake role in most reactions of alkanes , such as kb_cracking_(chemistry) and kb_protestant_reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers .in highly branched alkanes , the kb_bond_angle may differ significantly from the optimal kb_lightness ( 109.5° ) in kb_order_(biology) to allow the different kb_group_(mathematics) sufficient kb_space . this kb_causes_of_autism kb_a tension in the kb_molecule , known as kb_steric_hindrance hindrance , and can substantially increase the kb_reactivity_(chemistry) .all alkanes react with kb_oxygen in kb_a kb_combustion reaction , although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the kb_grammatical_number of kb_carbon atoms increases . the kb_general_(united_states) equation for complete kb_combustion is :in the absence of sufficient kb_oxygen , kb_carbon_monoxide or even kb_soot can kb_beryllium formed , as shown kb_#ecclesiastical_history :for example , kb_methane :kb_episcopal_see the kb_standard_enthalpy_change_of_formation_(data_table)#alkanes of formation table for detailed kb_big_data .the kb_standard_enthalpy_change_of_combustion enthalpy change of kb_combustion , δ '' kb_hydrogen '' , for alkanes increases by about 650 kb_kilojoule_per_mole per ch kb_group_(periodic_table) . branched-chain alkanes have lower values of δ '' kb_hydrogen '' than straight-chain alkanes of the same kb_grammatical_number of kb_carbon atoms , and kb_sulfate can kb_beryllium seen to kb_beryllium somewhat more stable .alkanes react with halogens in kb_a so-called `` kb_free_radical_halogenation halogenation '' reaction . the kb_hydrogen atoms of the kb_alkane are progressively replaced by kb_halogen atoms . free radicals are the kb_reactivity_(chemistry) kb_species that participate in the reaction , which usually leads to kb_a kb_mixture of products . the reaction is highly kb_exothermickb_cracking_(chemistry) breaks larger molecules into smaller ones . this can kb_beryllium done with kb_a kb_thermal_conductivity or catalytic method . the kb_thermal_conductivity kb_cracking_(chemistry) process follows kb_a kb_homolysis_(chemistry) kb_mechanism_(biology) with formation of free-radicals . the catalytic kb_cracking_(chemistry) process involves the presence of kb_acid kb_catalysis ( usually kb_solid acids such as kb_silica-alumina and zeolites ) , which promote kb_a kb_heterolytic_cleavage ( asymmetric ) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of kb_ions of kb_phyllotaxis charges , usually kb_a kb_carbocation and the very unstable kb_hydride kb_anion . carbon-localized free radicals and kb_cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement , c–c scission in kb_positional_notation kb_beta_decay ( i.e. , kb_cracking_(chemistry) ) and kb_intramolecular and kb_intermolecular kb_hydrogen transfer or kb_hydride transfer . in both types of processes , the corresponding kb_reactivity_(chemistry) intermediates ( radicals , kb_ions ) are permanently regenerated , and thus they proceed by kb_a self-propagating chain kb_mechanism_(biology) . the chain of reactions is eventually terminated by kb_political_radicalism or kb_ion kb_recombination_(cosmology) .dragan and kb_histidine colleague were the kb_first_trimester to report about isomerization in alkanes . isomerization and kb_protestant_reformation are processes in which straight-chain alkanes are heated in the presence of kb_a kb_platinum kb_catalyst . in isomerization , the alkanes become branched-chain isomers . in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_lexical_semantics , kb_it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens , keeping the same kb_molecular_weight . in kb_protestant_reformation , the alkanes become cycloalkanes or kb_aromatic kb_hydrocarbons , giving off kb_hydrogen as kb_a by-product . both of these processes raise the kb_octane_number of the kb_matter . kb_butane is the most common kb_alkane that is put under the process of isomerization , as kb_it makes many branched alkanes with kb_high_middle_ages kb_octane kb_grammatical_number .alkanes kb_will_and_testament react with kb_steam in the presence of kb_a kb_nickel kb_catalyst to give kb_hydrogen . alkanes can kb_beryllium kb_chlorosulfonation and kb_nitration , although both reactions require special conditions . the kb_fermentation_(biochemistry) of alkanes to carboxylic acids is of some technical importance . in the kb_reed_reaction reaction , kb_sulfur_dioxide , kb_chlorine and kb_light convert kb_hydrocarbons to kb_sulfonic_acid kb_chlorides . kb_nucleophilic_abstraction kb_abstraction can kb_beryllium used to separate an kb_alkane from kb_a kb_metal . kb_alkyl kb_group_(mathematics) can kb_beryllium transferred from

kb_gas planets such as kb_jupiter ( 0.1 % kb_methane , kb_alkaline_earth_metal kb_parts_per_million kb_ethane ) , kb_saturn ( 0.2 % kb_methane , 5 kb_parts_per_million kb_ethane ) , kb_uranus ( 1.99 % kb_methane , 2.5 kb_parts_per_million kb_ethane ) and kb_neptune ( 1.5 % kb_methane , 1.5 kb_parts_per_million kb_ethane ) . kb_titan_(mythology) ( 1.6 % kb_methane ) , kb_a kb_satellite of kb_saturn , was examined by the `` kb_christiaan_huygens '' kb_interplanetary_probe , which indicated that kb_titan_(mythology) 's kb_earth's_atmosphere periodically rains kb_liquid kb_methane onto the kb_moon 's kb_surface_(topology) . also on kb_titan_(mythology) the cassini mission has imaged seasonal methane/ethane kb_list_of_lakes_in_alberta near the kb_polar_molecule kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey of kb_titan_(mythology) . kb_methane and kb_ethane have also been kb_discovery_of_the_chemical_elements in the kb_tail of the kb_comet kb_hyakutake . kb_protein_sequencing kb_analysis showed that the abundances of kb_ethane and kb_methane were roughly equal , which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar kb_space , away from the kb_sun , which would have kb_evaporation these kb_volatiles molecules . alkanes have also been kb_discovery_of_the_chemical_elements in meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites .kb_trace_radioisotope of kb_methane kb_gas ( about 0.0002 % or kb_battle_of_anguilla ppb ) occur in the kb_earth 's kb_earth's_atmosphere , produced primarily by kb_methanogenesis microorganisms , such as kb_archaea in the gut of ruminants .the most important commercial sources for alkanes are kb_natural_gas and kb_palm_oil . kb_natural_gas contains primarily kb_methane and kb_ethane , with some kb_propane and kb_butane : kb_palm_oil is kb_a kb_mixture of kb_liquid alkanes and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hydrocarbons environment and converted over many millions of years at kb_high_middle_ages temperatures and kb_high_middle_ages kb_pressure to their kb_electric_current kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . kb_natural_gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction :these kb_hydrocarbon kb_deposit_(geology) , collected in porous kb_rock_(geology) trapped beneath impermeable cap kb_rock_(geology) , comprise commercial kb_oil_fields . they have formed over millions of years and once exhausted can not kb_beryllium readily replaced . the depletion of these kb_hydrocarbons reserves is the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) for what is known as the kb_energy_crisis .kb_methane is also present in what is called kb_biogas , produced by kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing and decaying kb_matter , which is kb_a possible kb_renewable_energy_source source .alkanes have kb_a low kb_solubility in kb_water , kb_sulfate the content in the oceans is negligible ; however , at kb_high_middle_ages pressures and low temperatures ( such as at the bottom of the oceans ) , kb_methane can co-crystallize with kb_water to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_solid kb_methane_clathratecertain types of kb_bacteria can kb_metabolism alkanes : they prefer even-numbered kb_carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-numbered chains .on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , certain kb_archaea , the methanogens , produce kb_prespa_lake quantities of kb_methane by the kb_metabolism of kb_carbon_dioxide or kb_other_(philosophy) kb_oxidation kb_organic_compounds . the kb_energy_industry is released by the kb_redox of kb_hydrogen :methanogens are also the producers of kb_marsh_gas kb_gas in kb_wetlands , and release about kb_2_(number) kb_billion kb_tonnes of kb_methane per year—the atmospheric content of this kb_gas is produced nearly exclusively by them . the kb_methane output of kb_cattle and kb_other_(philosophy) herbivores , which can release 30 to 50 gallons per day , and of kb_termites , is also due to methanogens . they also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the kb_intestines of humans . kb_methanogenesis kb_archaea are , hence , at the end of the kb_carbon_cycle , with kb_carbon kb_being released back into kb_earth's_atmosphere kb_earth's_atmosphere after having been fixed by kb_photosynthesis . kb_it is probable that our kb_electric_current kb_deposit_(geology) of kb_natural_gas were formed in kb_a similar way .alkanes also play kb_a role , if kb_a minor role , in the kb_biology of the kb_triliteral kb_eukaryote kb_group_(mathematics) of organisms : kb_fungi , plants and kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing . some specialized yeasts , e.g. , `` candida tropicale '' , `` kb_pichia '' sp. , `` kb_rhodotorula '' sp. , can use alkanes as kb_a source of kb_carbon or kb_energy_industry . the fungus `` kb_amorphotheca_resinae resinae '' prefers the longer-chain alkanes in kb_aviation_fuel , and can cause serious kb_problems_(aristotle) for kb_aircraft in kb_tropical kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey .in plants , the kb_solid long-chain alkanes are found in the kb_plant_cuticle and kb_epicuticular_wax kb_beeswax of many kb_species , but are only rarely kb_major_(united_states) kb_electoral_district . they protect the kb_plant against kb_water loss , prevent the kb_leaching_(agriculture) of important kb_minerals by the kb_rain , and protect against kb_bacteria , kb_fungi , and harmful insects . the kb_carbon chains in kb_plant alkanes are usually odd-numbered , between 27 and 33 kb_carbon atoms in kb_length and are made by the plants by kb_decarboxylation of even-numbered fatty acids . the exact kb_function_composition of the layer of kb_beeswax is not only species-dependent but changes also with the kb_season and such kb_environmental_factors factors as lighting conditions , kb_temperature or kb_humidity .more kb_volatiles short-chain alkanes are also produced by and found in kb_plant kb_tissue_(biology) . the kb_jeffrey_pine kb_pine is noted for producing exceptionally kb_high_middle_ages levels of `` kb_neutron '' -heptane in its kb_resin , for which kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving its distillate was designated as the kb_0_(number) point for kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_octane_rating . floral scents have also kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) been known to contain kb_volatiles kb_alkane components , and `` kb_neutron '' -nonane is kb_a significant component in the scent of some kb_rosaceae . kb_emission_spectra of gaseous and kb_volatiles alkanes such as kb_ethane , kb_pentane , and kb_hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels , though they are not generally considered to kb_beryllium kb_a kb_major_(united_states) component of biogenic kb_air_pollution .edible kb_vegetable kb_cooking_oil also typically contain small kb_egyptian_fraction of biogenic alkanes with kb_a wide kb_visible_spectrum of kb_carbon kb_grammatical_number , mainly kb_group_8_element to kb_35_arietis , usually peaking in the low to kb_upper_egypt 20s , with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram ( kb_part_per_million per million by weight ) and sometimes over kb_a hundred for the total kb_alkane kb_fraction_(mathematics) .alkanes are found in kb_animal products , although they are less important than unsaturated kb_hydrocarbons . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) example is the kb_shark kb_liver_oil , which is approximately 14 % kb_pristane ( 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane , ch ) . they are important as pheromones , kb_protein_sequencing messenger materials , on which insects depend for kb_communication . in some kb_species , e.g . the support beetle `` kb_xylotrechus_colonus colonus '' , kb_pentacosane ( ch ) , 3-methylpentaicosane ( ch ) and 9-methylpentaicosane ( ch ) are transferred by kb_human_body contact . with others like the kb_tsetse_fly kb_flight `` glossina morsitans morsitans '' , the kb_pheromone contains the four alkanes 2-methylheptadecane ( ch ) , 17,21-dimethylheptatriacontane ( ch ) , 15,19-dimethylheptatriacontane ( ch ) and 15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane ( ch ) , and acts by smell over longer distances . kb_waggle_dance kb_honey beeskb_one_(australian_tv_channel) example , in which both kb_plant and kb_animal alkanes play kb_a role , is the ecological relationship between the kb_sand_bee ( `` kb_andrena_nigroaenea nigroaenea '' ) and the kb_early_spider_orchid kb_spider kb_orchid ( `` kb_ophrys_sphegodes sphegodes '' ) ; the latter is dependent for kb_pollination on the former . kb_sand bees use pheromones in kb_order_(biology) to identify kb_a kb_mating ; in the case of `` a. nigroaenea '' , the females emit kb_a kb_mixture of kb_tricosane ( ch ) , kb_pentacosane ( ch ) and kb_heptacosaneas stated kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet , the most important source of alkanes is kb_natural_gas and kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil . alkanes are separated in an kb_oil_refinery by kb_fractional_distillation kb_distillation and processed into many different products .the kb_fischer–tropsch_process process is kb_a method to kb_biosynthesis kb_liquid kb_hydrocarbons , including alkanes , from kb_carbon_monoxide and kb_hydrogen . this method is used to produce substitutes for kb_petroleum distillates .there is usually little need for alkanes to kb_beryllium synthesized in the kb_laboratory , since they are usually commercially kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance . also , alkanes are generally kb_reactivity_(chemistry) chemically or biologically , and do not undergo kb_functional_group kb_group_(periodic_table) interconversions cleanly . when alkanes are produced in the kb_laboratory , kb_it is often kb_a side-product of kb_a reaction . for example , the use of `` kb_neutron '' -butyllithium as kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_base_(chemistry) gives the conjugate kb_acid , `` kb_neutron '' -butane as kb_a side-product :however , at times kb_it may kb_beryllium desirable to make kb_a kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) of kb_a kb_molecule into an alkane-like functionality ( kb_alkyl kb_group_(periodic_table) ) using the above or similar methods . for example , an kb_ethyl_group is an kb_alkyl kb_group_(periodic_table) ; when this is attached to kb_a kb_hydroxyl kb_group_(periodic_table) , kb_it gives kb_ethanol , which is not an kb_alkane . to kb_women's_suffrage kb_sulfate , the best-known methods are kb_hydrogenation of kb_alkenes :alkanes or kb_alkyl kb_group_(mathematics) can also kb_beryllium prepared directly from kb_alkyl halides in the kb_corey–house_synthesis reaction . the kb_barton–mccombie_deoxygenation deoxygenation removes kb_hydroxy_group kb_group_(mathematics) from alcohols e.g .and the kb_clemmensen_reduction kb_redox removes kb_carbonyl kb_group_(mathematics) from kb_aldehydes and ketones to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism alkanes or alkyl-substituted kb_chemical_compound e.g . :the applications of alkanes depend on the kb_grammatical_number of kb_carbon atoms . the kb_first_trimester four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes , and in some countries for electricity generation . kb_methane and kb_ethane are the main components of kb_natural_gas ; they are normally stored as gases under kb_pressure . kb_it is , however , easier to kb_transport them as liquids : this requires both kb_dynamic_range_compression and cooling of the kb_gas .kb_propane and kb_butane are gases at atmospheric kb_pressure that can kb_beryllium liquefied at fairly low pressures and are commonly known as kb_liquified_petroleum_gas kb_petroleum kb_gas ( lpg ) . kb_propane is used in kb_propane kb_gas burners and as kb_a kb_fuel for road vehicles , kb_butane in kb_space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters . both are used as propellants in kb_aerosol sprays .from kb_pentane to kb_octane the alkanes are highly kb_volatiles liquids . they are used as fuels in internal kb_combustion engines , as they vaporize easily on kb_azerbaijan_in_the_eurovision_song_contest_2009 into the kb_combustion_chamber without forming droplets , which would impair the uniformity of the kb_combustion . branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition , which kb_causes_of_autism kb_engine_knocking , than their straight-chain kb_homology_(chemistry) . this propensity to premature ignition is measured by the kb_octane_rating of the kb_fuel , where kb_2,2,4-trimethylpentane ( `` isooctane '' ) has an arbitrary kb_lightness of 100 , and kb_heptane has kb_a kb_lightness of kb_0_(number) . apart from their use as fuels , the middle alkanes are also good solvents for kb_nonpolar substances .alkanes from kb_nonane to , for instance , kb_hexadecane ( an kb_alkane with sixteen kb_carbon atoms ) are liquids of higher kb_viscosity , less and less suitable for use in kb_gasoline . they kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism instead the kb_major_(united_states) part of kb_diesel_engine and kb_aviation_fuel . kb_diesel_engine fuels are characterized by their kb_cetane_number kb_grammatical_number , cetane kb_being an kb_old_testament kb_toponymy for kb_hexadecane . however , the higher kb_melting_point points of these alkanes can cause kb_problems_(aristotle) at low temperatures and in kb_polar_molecule kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey , where the kb_fuel becomes too thick to kb_flow_(psychology) correctly .alkanes from kb_hexadecane upwards kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the most important components of kb_fuel_oil and kb_lubricating_oil kb_palm_oil . in the latter kb_function_(biology) , they kb_cold_working at the same kb_time_(magazine) as anti-corrosive agents , as their

on the kb_type_(biology) of case and the kb_biological_rules of the kb_court in the kb_jurisdiction where the case was prosecuted . there are many types of kb_standard_of_review of kb_review for

there is kb_a kb_right-wing_politics of kb_appeal from kb_a kb_particular kb_type_(biology) of decision , can vary greatly from kb_state_of_matter to kb_state_of_matter . the kb_right-wing_politics to file an kb_appeal can also vary from kb_state_of_matter to kb_state_of_matter ; for example , the kb_new_jersey_constitution vests kb_judicial_power kb_power_(physics) in kb_a supreme kb_court , kb_a

kb_file_(tool) an kb_appeal is called an `` appellant '' , `` kb_plaintiff in kb_error '' , `` petitioner '' or `` pursuer '' , and kb_a party on the kb_other_(philosophy) side is called kb_a `` appellee '' . kb_a `` cross-appeal '' is an kb_appeal brought by the respondent . for example , suppose at kb_jury_trial the judge found for the kb_plaintiff and kb_totally_ordered_set the kb_defendant to pay kb_usd 50,000 . if the kb_defendant kb_file_(tool) an kb_appeal arguing that kb_he_(letter) should not have to pay any kb_money , then the kb_plaintiff might file kb_a cross-appeal arguing that the kb_defendant should have to pay kb_usd 200,000 instead of kb_usd 50,000 .the appellant is the party kb_world_health_organization , having kb_lost_film part or all their kb_lawsuit in kb_a kb_lower_court kb_court decision , is appealing to kb_a higher kb_court to have their case reconsidered . this is usually done on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) that the kb_lower_court kb_court judge erred in the kb_application_(computing) of kb_law , but kb_it may also kb_beryllium possible to kb_appeal on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of kb_court misconduct , or that kb_a finding of kb_fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the kb_evidence_(law) .the appellant in the kb_new_world case can kb_beryllium either the kb_plaintiff ( or claimant ) , kb_defendant , third-party kb_intervenor , or respondent ( appellee ) from the kb_lower_case case , depending on kb_world_health_organization was the losing party . the winning party from the kb_lower_court kb_court , however , is now the respondent . in unusual kb_noun_case the appellant can kb_beryllium the victor in the kb_court kb_#ecclesiastical_history , but still kb_appeal .an appellee is the party to an kb_appeal in which the kb_lower_court kb_court kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition was in its favor . the appellee is required to respond to the kb_petition , oral arguments , and kb_law kb_brief_(law) of the appellant . in kb_general_(united_states) , the appellee takes the procedural posture that the kb_lower_court kb_court 's decision should kb_beryllium affirmed .an kb_appeal `` as of

kb_court can not refuse to listen to the kb_appeal . an kb_appeal `` by leave '' or `` permission '' requires the appellant to obtain leave to kb_appeal ; in such kb_a situation either or both of the kb_lower_court kb_court and the kb_court may have the discretion to kb_ulysses_s._grant or refuse the appellant 's demand to kb_appeal the kb_lower_court kb_court 's decision . in the supreme kb_court , kb_review in most kb_noun_case is kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance only if the kb_court exercises its discretion and grants kb_a writ of certiorari .in kb_tort , kb_equity_(law) , or kb_other_(philosophy) civil matters either party to kb_a previous case may file an kb_appeal . in criminal matters , however , the kb_state_of_matter or prosecution generally has no kb_appeal `` as of kb_right-wing_politics '' . and due to the kb_double_jeopardy jeopardy kb_principle_(chemistry) , the kb_state_of_matter or prosecution may never kb_appeal kb_a kb_jury or bench verdict of acquittal . but in some jurisdictions , the kb_state_of_matter or prosecution may kb_appeal `` as of kb_right-wing_politics '' from kb_a kb_trial_court 's dismissal of an kb_indictment in whole or in part or from kb_a kb_trial_court 's granting of kb_a kb_defendant 's suppression kb_motion_(physics) . likewise , in some jurisdictions , the kb_state_of_matter or prosecution may kb_appeal an issue of kb_law `` by leave '' from kb_the_trial kb_trial_court or the kb_appellate_court kb_court . the ability of the prosecution to kb_appeal kb_a decision in favor of kb_a kb_defendant varies significantly internationally . all parties must present grounds to kb_appeal , or kb_it kb_will_and_testament not kb_beryllium heard .by kb_fan_convention in some kb_law reports , the appellant is kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_first_trimester . this can kb_mean that where kb_it is the kb_defendant kb_world_health_organization appeals , the kb_toponymy of the case in kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law reports reverses ( in some kb_noun_case twice ) as the appeals kb_cold_working their way up the kb_court hierarchy . this is not always kb_truth , however . in the kb_united_states_federal_courts , the parties ' names always stay in the same kb_order_(biology) as the kb_lower_court kb_court when an kb_appeal is taken to the kb_united_states_courts_of_appeals courts of appeals , and are re-ordered only if the kb_appeal reaches the supreme kb_court .many jurisdictions recognize kb_2_(number) types of appeals , particularly in the criminal kb_context_(language_use) . the kb_first_trimester is the traditional `` direct '' kb_appeal in which the appellant kb_file_(tool) an kb_appeal with the kb_next higher kb_court of kb_review . the kb_second_language is the collateral kb_appeal or post-conviction kb_petition , in which the petitioner-appellant kb_file_(tool) the kb_appeal in kb_a kb_court of kb_first_trimester instance—usually the kb_court that tried the case .the kb_key_(cryptography) distinguishing kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in kb_state_court_(united_states) , and the latter in kb_united_states_federal_courts .kb_relief in post-conviction is rare and is most often found in kb_list_of_australian_capital_cities or violent kb_felony kb_noun_case . the typical scenario involves an incarcerated kb_defendant locating kb_dna kb_evidence_(law) demonstrating the kb_defendant 's actual innocence .`` appellate kb_review '' is the kb_general_(united_states) kb_terminology for the process by which courts with appellate kb_jurisdiction kb_take kb_jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts . kb_it is distinguished from kb_judicial_review kb_review , which refers to the kb_court 's overriding kb_constitution_of_albania or kb_statute kb_right-wing_politics to determine if kb_a kb_legislative act or kb_administration_(government) decision is defective for jurisdictional or kb_other_(philosophy) reasons ( which may vary by kb_jurisdiction ) .in most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate kb_review is by filing an kb_appeal of the kb_final_judgment kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition . generally , an kb_appeal of the kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition kb_will_and_testament also allow kb_appeal of all kb_other_(philosophy) kb_order_(biology) or rulings made by kb_the_trial kb_trial_court in the course of the case . this is because such kb_order_(biology) can not kb_beryllium appealed `` as of kb_right-wing_politics '' . however , certain critical interlocutory kb_court kb_order_(biology) , such as the denial of kb_a request for an interim kb_injunction , or an kb_order_(biology) holding kb_a kb_grammatical_person in kb_contempt_of_court of kb_court , can kb_beryllium appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of .there are kb_2_(number) distinct kb_theory_of_forms of appellate kb_review , `` direct '' and `` collateral '' . for example , kb_a criminal kb_defendant may kb_beryllium convicted in kb_state_of_matter kb_court , and lose on `` direct kb_appeal '' to higher kb_state_of_matter appellate courts , and if unsuccessful , mount kb_a `` collateral '' action such as filing for kb_a writ of kb_habeas_corpus corpus in the kb_united_states_federal_courts . generally speaking , `` [ d ] irect kb_appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of kb_a kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition and allege kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics of kb_law or kb_fact . ... [ collateral kb_review ] , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , provide [ kb_sulfur ] an independent and civil kb_inquiry into the kb_validity_(logic) of kb_a conviction and kb_sentence_(law) , and as such are generally limited to challenges to kb_constitution_of_albania , jurisdictional , or kb_other_(philosophy) fundamental violations that occurred at kb_jury_trial .

kb_law courts , appellate kb_review of kb_lower_court kb_court decisions may also kb_beryllium obtained by filing kb_a kb_petition_for_review kb_review by kb_prerogative_writ writ in certain kb_noun_case . there is no corresponding kb_right-wing_politics to kb_a writ in any pure or kb_continental_dollar kb_civil_law_(legal_system) kb_law kb_law kb_systems_analysis , though some mixed kb_systems_analysis such as kb_province_of_quebec_(1763–1791) recognize these prerogative writs .after exhausting the kb_first_trimester kb_appeal as of kb_right-wing_politics , defendants usually kb_petition the highest kb_state_of_matter kb_court to kb_review the decision . this kb_appeal is known as kb_a direct kb_appeal . the highest kb_state_of_matter kb_court , generally known as the supreme kb_court , exercises discretion over whether kb_it kb_will_and_testament kb_review the case . on direct kb_appeal , kb_a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an kb_error that occurred at kb_jury_trial or some kb_other_(philosophy) stage in the adjudicative process .an appellant 's kb_lawsuit ( kb_sulfur ) must usually kb_beryllium preserved at kb_jury_trial . this means that the kb_defendant had to kb_space_debris to the kb_error when kb_it occurred in kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial . because kb_constitution_of_albania claims are of great kb_apparent_magnitude , appellate courts might kb_beryllium more lenient to kb_review the kb_lawsuit even if kb_it was not preserved . for example , kb_connecticut applies the following standard to kb_review unpreserved claims : 1.the record is adequate to kb_review the alleged kb_lawsuit of kb_error ; 2. the kb_lawsuit is of kb_constitution_of_albania kb_apparent_magnitude alleging the violation of kb_a fundamental kb_right-wing_politics ; 3. the alleged kb_constitution_of_albania violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the kb_defendant of kb_a fair kb_jury_trial ; 4. if kb_grammatical_subject to harmless kb_error kb_analysis , the kb_state_of_matter has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged kb_constitution_of_albania violation beyond kb_a reasonable doubt .all kb_sovereign_state have kb_a post-conviction kb_relief process . similar to kb_united_states_courts_of_appeals post-conviction kb_relief , an appellant can kb_petition the kb_court to correct alleged fundamental kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics that were not corrected on direct kb_review . typical claims might include kb_ineffective_assistance_of_counsel assistance of counsel and actual innocence based on kb_new_world kb_evidence_(law) . these proceedings are normally separate from the direct kb_appeal , however some kb_sovereign_state allow for collateral kb_relief to kb_beryllium sought on direct kb_appeal . after direct kb_appeal , the conviction is considered final . an kb_appeal from the post conviction kb_court proceeds just as kb_a direct kb_appeal . that is , kb_it goes to the intermediate kb_appellate_court kb_court , followed by the highest kb_court . if the kb_petition is granted the appellant could kb_beryllium released from incarceration , the kb_sentence_(law) could kb_beryllium modified , or kb_a kb_new_world kb_jury_trial could kb_beryllium kb_totally_ordered_set .kb_a `` notice of kb_appeal '' is kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism or document that in many kb_noun_case is required to begin an kb_appeal . the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism is completed by the appellant or by the appellant 's kb_law representative . the kb_nature of this kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism can vary greatly from kb_country_music to kb_country_music and from kb_court to kb_court within kb_a kb_country_music .the specific kb_biological_rules of the kb_law system kb_will_and_testament dictate exactly how the kb_appeal is officially begun . for example , the appellant might have to file the notice of kb_appeal with the kb_appellate_court kb_court , or with the kb_court from which the kb_appeal is taken , or both .some courts have samples of kb_a notice of kb_appeal on the kb_court 's own kb_world_wide_web site . in kb_new_jersey , for example , the kb_administration_(government) kb_office of the kb_court has promulgated kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of notice of kb_appeal for use by appellants , though using this exact kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism is not mandatory and the failure to use kb_it is not kb_a jurisdictional kb_congenital_disorder provided that all pertinent kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) is kb_set_(mythology) forth in whatever kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of notice of kb_appeal is used .the deadline for beginning an kb_appeal can often kb_beryllium very short : traditionally , kb_it is measured in days , not months . this can vary from kb_country_music to kb_country_music , as kb_water_well as within kb_a kb_country_music , depending on the specific kb_biological_rules in kb_force . in the kb_united_states_navy kb_united_states_courts_of_appeals kb_court system , criminal defendants must file kb_a notice of kb_appeal within 10 days of the kb_azerbaijan_in_the_eurovision_song_contest_2009 of either the kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition or the kb_order_(biology) kb_being appealed , or the kb_right-wing_politics to kb_appeal is forfeited .generally speaking the kb_appellate_court kb_court examines the record of kb_evidence_(law) presented in kb_the_trial kb_trial_court and kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law that the kb_lower_court kb_court kb_applied_science and decides whether that decision was legally kb_sound or not . the kb_appellate_court kb_court kb_will_and_testament typically kb_beryllium deferential to the kb_lower_court kb_court 's findings of kb_fact ( such as whether kb_a kb_defendant committed kb_a kb_particular act ) , unless clearly erroneous , and kb_sulfate kb_will_and_testament focus on the kb_court 's kb_application_(computing) of kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law to those facts ( such as whether the act found by the kb_court to have occurred fits kb_a kb_law kb_definition at issue ) .if the kb_appellate_court kb_court finds no kb_congenital_disorder , kb_it `` affirms '' the kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition . if the kb_appellate_court kb_court does find kb_a kb_law kb_congenital_disorder in the decision `` kb_#ecclesiastical_history '' ( i.e. , in the kb_lower_court kb_court ) , kb_it may `` modify '' the ruling to correct the kb_congenital_disorder , or kb_it may nullify ( `` kb_obverse_and_reverse '' or `` vacate '' ) the whole decision or any part of kb_it . kb_it may , in kb_addition , send the case back ( `` remand '' or `` remit '' ) to the kb_lower_court kb_court for further proceedings to remedy the kb_congenital_disorder .in some kb_noun_case , an kb_appellate_court kb_court may kb_review kb_a kb_lower_court kb_court decision `` kb_trial_de_novo '' ( or completely ) , challenging even the kb_lower_court kb_court 's findings of kb_fact . this might kb_beryllium the proper kb_standard_of_review of kb_review , for example , if the kb_lower_court kb_court resolved the case by granting kb_a pre-trial kb_motion_to_dismiss dismiss or kb_motion_(physics) for kb_summary_judgment kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition which is usually based only upon written submissions to kb_the_trial kb_trial_court and not on any kb_jury_trial testimony .another situation is where kb_appeal is by way of `` re-hearing '' . certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial to kb_beryllium heard afresh in the kb_appellate_court kb_court .sometimes , the kb_appellate_court kb_court finds kb_a kb_congenital_disorder in the procedure the parties used in filing the kb_appeal and dismisses the kb_appeal without considering its merits , which has the same effect as affirming the kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition kb_#ecclesiastical_history . ( this would happen , for example , if the appellant waited too kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , under the kb_appellate_court kb_court 's kb_biological_rules , to file the kb_appeal . )generally , there is no kb_jury_trial in an kb_appellate_court kb_court , only consideration of the record of the kb_evidence_(law) presented to kb_the_trial kb_trial_court and all the pre-trial and kb_trial_court proceedings are reviewed—unless the kb_appeal is by way of re-hearing , kb_new_world kb_evidence_(law) kb_will_and_testament usually only kb_beryllium considered on kb_appeal in `` very '' rare instances , for example if that kb_material kb_evidence_(law) was unavailable to kb_a party for some very significant kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving such as kb_prosecutorial_misconduct misconduct .in some kb_systems_analysis , an kb_appellate_court kb_court kb_will_and_testament only consider the written decision of the kb_lower_court kb_court , together with any written kb_evidence_(law) that was before that kb_court and is relevant to the kb_appeal . in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_systems_analysis , the kb_appellate_court kb_court kb_will_and_testament normally consider the record of the kb_lower_court kb_court . in those kb_noun_case the record kb_will_and_testament kb_first_trimester kb_beryllium certified by the kb_lower_court kb_court .the appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the kb_appeal and the appellee ( or respondent ) can present arguments against kb_it . arguments of the parties to the kb_appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers , if represented , or `` kb_pro_se se '' if the party has not engaged kb_law kb_representation_(arts) . those arguments are presented in written kb_brief_(law) and sometimes in kb_oral_argument kb_argument_of_a_function to the kb_court at kb_a kb_hearing_loss . at such hearings each party is allowed kb_a brief presentation at which the appellate kb_book_of_judges kb_amplitude-shift_keying questions based on their kb_review of the record kb_#ecclesiastical_history and the submitted kb_brief_(law) .in an kb_adversarial_system system , appellate courts do not have the kb_power_(physics) to kb_review kb_lower_court kb_court decisions unless kb_a party appeals kb_it . therefore , if kb_a kb_lower_court kb_court has ruled in an improper manner , or against kb_precedent , that kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition kb_will_and_testament stand if not appealed – even if kb_it might have been overturned on kb_appeal .the united kb_sovereign_state kb_law system generally recognizes kb_2_(number) types of appeals : kb_a kb_jury_trial `` kb_trial_de_novo '' or an kb_appeal on the record .kb_a kb_trial_de_novo novo is usually kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance for kb_review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural kb_attribute_(role-playing_games) of kb_a formal judicial kb_jury_trial . if unchallenged , these decisions have the kb_power_(physics) to settle more minor kb_law disputes once and for all . if kb_a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such kb_a kb_tribunal , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) generally has the kb_power_(physics) to request kb_a kb_jury_trial `` kb_trial_de_novo '' by kb_a kb_court_of_record record . in such kb_a proceeding , all issues and kb_evidence_(law) may kb_beryllium kb_adaptation newly , as though never heard before , and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) is not restricted to the kb_evidence_(law) heard in the lower proceeding . sometimes , however , the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as kb_evidence_(law) , thus helping to curb frivolous appeals .in some kb_noun_case , an kb_application_(computing) for `` kb_trial_de_novo novo '' effectively erases the kb_prior kb_jury_trial as if kb_it had never taken kb_place_of_articulation . the supreme kb_court of kb_virginia has stated that ' '' this kb_court has repeatedly held that the effect of an kb_appeal to circuit kb_court is to `` annul the kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition of the inferior kb_tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous kb_jury_trial . '' ' the only exception to this is that if kb_a kb_defendant appeals kb_a conviction for kb_a crime having kb_cross-platform_software levels of offenses , where they are convicted on kb_a lesser offense , the kb_appeal is of the lesser offense ; the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses . `` [ kb_a ] kb_jury_trial on the same charges in the circuit kb_court does not violate kb_double_jeopardy jeopardy principles , . . . kb_grammatical_subject only to the limitation that conviction in [ the ] kb_united_states_territorial_court for an offense lesser included in the kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_electric_charge constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense ,permitting kb_trial_de_novo novo in the circuit kb_court only for the lesser-included offense . ''in an kb_appeal on the record from kb_a decision in kb_a judicial proceeding , both appellant and respondent are kb_bound_morpheme to kb_base_(chemistry) their arguments wholly on the proceedings and kb_human_body of kb_evidence_(law) as they were presented in the lower kb_tribunal . each seeks to prove to the higher kb_court that the result they desired was the just result . kb_stare_decisis and kb_case_law kb_law kb_female_body_shape prominently in the arguments . in kb_order_(biology) for the kb_appeal to succeed , the appellant must prove that the kb_lower_court kb_court committed kb_reversible_error , that is , an impermissible action by the kb_court acted to cause kb_a result that was unjust , and which would not have resulted had the kb_court acted properly . some examples of kb_reversible_error would kb_beryllium erroneously instructing the kb_jury on kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law applicable to the case , permitting seriously kb_improper_argument kb_argument_of_a_function by an attorney , admitting or excluding kb_evidence_(law) improperly , acting outside the kb_court 's kb_jurisdiction , injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to kb_women's_suffrage kb_sulfate , juror misconduct , etc . the failure to formally kb_space_debris at the kb_time_(magazine) , to what kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) views as improper action in the kb_lower_court kb_court , may result in the affirmance of the kb_lower_court kb_court 's kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition on the grounds that kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) did not `` preserve the issue for kb_appeal '' by objecting .in kb_noun_case where kb_a judge rather than kb_a kb_jury decided issues of kb_fact , an kb_appellate_court kb_court kb_will_and_testament apply an `` kb_abuse_of_discretion of discretion '' kb_standard_of_review of kb_review . under this standard , the kb_appellate_court kb_court gives deference to the kb_lower_court kb_court 's view of the kb_evidence_(law) , and reverses its decision only if kb_it were kb_a clear kb_abuse_of_discretion of discretion . this is usually kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as kb_a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness . on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , the kb_appellate_court kb_court normally gives less deference to kb_a kb_lower_court kb_court 's decision on issues of kb_law , and may kb_obverse_and_reverse if kb_it finds that the kb_lower_court kb_court kb_applied_science the wrong kb_law standard .in some kb_noun_case , an appellant may successfully argue that kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law under which the lower decision was rendered was kb_constitutionality or otherwise invalid , or may convince the higher kb_court to kb_order_(biology) kb_a kb_new_world kb_jury_trial on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) that kb_evidence_(law) kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet sought was concealed or only recently discovered . in the case of kb_new_world kb_evidence_(law) , there must kb_beryllium kb_a kb_high_middle_ages kb_probability that its presence or absence would have made kb_a kb_material difference in kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial . another issue suitable for kb_appeal in criminal kb_noun_case is effective assistance of counsel . if kb_a kb_defendant has been convicted and can prove that kb_histidine kb_lawyer did not adequately handle kb_histidine case and that there is kb_a reasonable kb_probability that the result of kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial would have been different had the kb_lawyer given competent kb_representation_(arts) , kb_he_(letter) is entitled to kb_a kb_new_world kb_jury_trial .kb_a kb_lawyer traditionally starts an kb_oral_argument kb_argument_of_a_function to any kb_appellate_court kb_court with the kb_lexical_semantics `` may kb_it please the kb_court .

.if the kb_defendant pleads kb_plea#guilty_and_not_guilty_pleas kb_guilt_(law) , kb_a date is kb_set_(mythology) for kb_a kb_preliminary_hearing kb_hearing_loss or kb_a kb_jury_trial .in the kb_past ,

kb_evolution of the abacus is still unknown . today , abacuses are often constructed as kb_a kb_bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires , but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in kb_sand or on tablets of kb_wood , stone , or kb_metal .abacuses come in different designs . some designs , like the bead frame consisting of beads divided into tens , are used mainly to teach kb_arithmetic , although they remain popular in the kb_post-soviet_states kb_sovereign_state as kb_a kb_tool . kb_other_(philosophy) designs , such as the kb_japanese_film kb_soroban , have been used

( אבק ) , `` kb_dust '' ( or in post-biblical kb_word_sense kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_sand used as kb_a writing kb_surface_(topology) '' ) .the preferred plural of `` abacus '' is kb_a kb_grammatical_subject of disagreement , with both `` abacuses '' and `` abaci '' ( hard `` kb_vitamin_c '' ) in use . the kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) of an abacus is called an `` abacist '' .the period 2700–2300 bc saw the kb_first_trimester kb_appearance_(philosophy) of the kb_sumerian_language abacus , kb_a table of successive columns which delimited the successive kb_order_(biology)

'' kb_it can kb_beryllium expressed in kb_hexadecimal or any of the following kb_grammatical_number , and because the kb_calculation method at that kb_time_(magazine) is kb_a kb_chinese_characters catty equal to sixteen tael（一斤十六兩）which means kb_hexadecimal , the abacus is kb_aircraft_design_process as kb_a two-five bead .`` kb_suanpan '' can kb_beryllium used for functions kb_other_(philosophy) than counting . unlike the kb_simple_polygon counting board used in kb_elementary_school schools , very efficient kb_suanpan techniques have been kb_adaptation to do kb_multiplication , kb_division_(mathematics) , kb_addition , kb_subtraction , kb_square_root and kb_cube_root kb_root_of_a_function operations at kb_high_middle_ages speed . there are currently schools teaching students how to use kb_it .in the kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) scroll `` kb_along_the_river_during_the_qingming_festival the kb_river during the qingming festival '' painted by kb_zhang_zeduan zeduan during the kb_song_dynasty kb_dynasty ( 960–1297 ) , kb_a `` kb_suanpan '' is clearly visible beside an account book and kb_physician 's prescriptions on the counter of an kb_apothecary 's ( feibao ) .the similarity of the kb_roman_abacus to the kb_chinese_characters kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) suggests that kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) could have inspired the kb_other_(philosophy) , as there is some kb_evidence_(law) of kb_a kb_trade relationship between the kb_roman_empire and kb_china . however , no direct connection can kb_beryllium demonstrated , and the similarity of the abacuses may kb_beryllium coincidental , both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per kb_hand . where the kb_roman_empire kb_rutherford_model ( like most kb_modern_history kb_korean_language and kb_japanese_film ) has 4 plus 1 bead per kb_decimal kb_place_of_articulation , the standard `` kb_suanpan '' has 5 plus kb_alkaline_earth_metal . ( incidentally , this allows use with kb_a kb_hexadecimal kb_numeral_system system , which was used for traditional kb_chinese_characters measures of weight . ) instead of running on wires as in the kb_chinese_characters , kb_korean_language , and kb_japanese_film models , the beads of kb_roman_empire kb_rutherford_model run in grooves , presumably making kb_arithmetic calculations much slower .another possible source of the `` kb_suanpan '' is kb_chinese_characters kb_counting_rods kb_rod_cell , which operated with kb_a kb_decimal but lacked the kb_concept of kb_0_(number) as kb_a kb_place_of_articulation holder . the kb_0_(number) was probably introduced to the kb_chinese_characters in the kb_tang_dynasty ( 618–907 ) when kb_air_travel in the kb_indian_ocean and the kb_middle_east kb_east_africa would have provided direct contact with kb_indian_subcontinent , allowing them to acquire the kb_concept of kb_0_(number) and the kb_decimal_pointthe normal method of kb_calculation in kb_ancient_rome , as in kb_greece , was by moving counters on kb_a smooth table . originally pebbles ( `` calculi '' ) were used . later , and in kb_middle_ages , jetons were manufactured . marked lines indicated units , fives , tens etc . as in the kb_roman_numeral system . this system of 'counter casting ' continued into the late kb_roman_empire and in kb_middle_ages , and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century . due to kb_pope_sylvester_ii ii 's reintroduction of the abacus with modifications , kb_it became widely used in kb_europe once again during the 11th century this abacus used beads on wires , unlike the traditional kb_roman_empire counting boards , which meant the abacus could kb_beryllium used much faster .writing in the 1st century bc , kb_horace refers to the kb_beeswax abacus , kb_a board covered with kb_a thin layer of kb_black_sea kb_beeswax on which columns and figures were kb_inscribed_figure using kb_a stylus .kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) example of kb_archaeology kb_evidence_(law) of the kb_roman_abacus , shown here in kb_reconstruction_era , dates to the 1st century kb_anno_domini . kb_it has eight kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or no beads in each . the groove marked kb_iodine indicates units , x tens , and kb_sulfate on up to millions . the beads in the shorter grooves denote fives –five units , five tens etc. , essentially in kb_a kb_bi-quinary_coded_decimal coded kb_decimal , related to the kb_roman_numerals . the short grooves on the kb_right-wing_politics may have been used for marking kb_roman_empire `` ounces '' ( i.e . kb_egyptian_fraction ) .the kb_decimal kb_grammatical_number system invented in kb_indian_subcontinent replaced the abacus in kb_western_europe .the `` kb_abhidharmakośabhāṣya '' of kb_vasubandhu ( 316-396 ) , kb_a kb_sanskrit kb_cold_working on kb_buddhist_philosophy , says that the second-century kb_council_of_europe kb_philosophy kb_vasumitrain kb_japanese_film , the abacus is called `` kb_soroban '' ( , lit . `` counting tray '' ) , imported from kb_china in the 14th century . kb_it was probably in use by the working kb_class_(biology) kb_a century or more before the kb_ruling_class kb_class_(biology) started , as the kb_class_(biology) kb_structure did not allow for devices used by the lower kb_class_(biology) to kb_beryllium kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome or used by the kb_ruling_class kb_class_(biology) . the 1/4 abacus , which is suited to kb_decimal kb_calculation popular appeared circa 1930 , and became widespread as the kb_japanese_film abandoned kb_hexadecimal weight kb_calculation which was still common in kb_china .today 's kb_japanese_film abacus is kb_a 1:4 kb_type_(biology) , four-bead abacus was introduced from kb_china in the muromachi era . kb_it adopts the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of the kb_upper_egypt deck kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) bead and the bottom four beads . the top bead on the kb_upper_egypt deck was equal to five and the bottom kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) is equal to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) like the kb_chinese_characters or kb_korean_language abacus , and the kb_decimal kb_grammatical_number can kb_beryllium expressed , kb_sulfate the abacus is kb_aircraft_design_process as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) four abacus . the beads are always in the kb_shape of kb_a kb_diamond . the kb_quotient_ring kb_division_(mathematics) is generally used instead of the kb_division_(mathematics) method ; at the same kb_time_(magazine) , in kb_order_(biology) to make the kb_multiplication and kb_division_(mathematics) digits consistently use the kb_division_(mathematics) kb_multiplication . later , kb_japan had kb_a 3:5 abacus called天三算盤 , which is now the ize rongji kb_class_(set_theory) of shansi village in yamagata kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey . there were also had 2:5 beads abacus .with the four-bead abacus kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) , kb_it is also common to use kb_japanese_film abacus around the kb_world_war_ii . there are also improved kb_japanese_film abacus in various places . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the japanese-made abacus made in kb_china is an aluminum frame kb_plastic bead abacus . the file is kb_next to the four beads , and the `` clearing '' kb_button_(control) , kb_news_media the clearing kb_button_(control) , immediately put the kb_upper_egypt bead to the kb_upper_egypt kb_positional_notation , the lower bead is dialed to the lower kb_positional_notation , immediately clearing , easy to use .the abacus is still manufactured in kb_japan today even with the proliferation , practicality , and affordability of pocket kb_electronic_computer calculators . the use of the kb_soroban is still taught in kb_japanese_film kb_primary_education schools as part of kb_mathematics , primarily as an kb_aid to faster kb_mental_health kb_calculation . using visual kb_imagery of kb_a kb_soroban , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) can arrive at the answer in the same kb_time_(magazine) as , or even faster than , is possible with kb_a kb_health instrument .the kb_chinese_characters abacus migrated from kb_china to kb_koreasome sources mention the use of an abacus called kb_a `` nepohualtzintzin '' in kb_ancient_history kb_aztec kb_albanian_culture . this mesoamerican abacus used kb_a 5-digit base-20 system .kb_the_word_(free_love) word nepōhualtzintzin comes from kb_nahuatl and kb_it is formed by the kb_semitic_root ; `` kb_[neon '' – kb_personal_property - ; `` pōhual '' or `` pōhualli '' – the account - ; and `` tzintzin '' – small similar kb_chemical_element . its complete kb_meaning_(linguistics) was taken as : counting with small similar kb_chemical_element by somebody . its use was taught in the kb_calmecac to the `` temalpouhqueh '' , kb_world_health_organization were students dedicated to kb_take the accounts of skies , from kb_childhood .the nepōhualtzintzin was divided in kb_2_(number) main parts separated by kb_a bar or intermediate cord . in the kb_left-wing_politics part there were four beads , which in the kb_first_trimester row have kb_unitary_state values ( 1 , kb_alkaline_earth_metal , 3 , and 4 ) , and in the kb_right-wing_politics side there are kb_triliteral beads with values of 5 , 10 , and 15 respectively . in kb_order_(biology) to know the kb_lightness of the respective beads of the kb_upper_egypt rows , kb_it is enough to multiply by 20 ( by each row ) , the kb_lightness of the corresponding account in the kb_first_trimester row .altogether , there were kb_boron_group rows with 7 beads in each kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) , which made up 91 beads in each nepōhualtzintzin . this was kb_a kb_base_(chemistry) kb_grammatical_number to kb_natural_language_understanding , 7 times kb_boron_group , kb_a close relation conceived between kb_natural_number kb_phenomenon , the kb_underworld and the kb_cycle_(graph_theory) of the heavens . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) nepōhualtzintzin ( 91 ) represented the kb_grammatical_number of days that kb_a kb_season of the year lasts , kb_2_(number) nepōhualtzitzin ( 182 ) is the kb_grammatical_number of days of the kb_corn 's cycle , from its sowing to its kb_harvest , kb_triliteral nepōhualtzintzin ( 273 ) is the kb_grammatical_number of days of kb_a baby 's kb_gestation , and four nepōhualtzintzin ( 364 ) completed kb_cyclic_compound and approximate kb_a year ( 1 days short ) . when translated into kb_modern_history kb_apollo_guidance_computer kb_arithmetic , the nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the kb_18-point_agreement in kb_floating_point point , which calculated stellar as kb_water_well as infinitesimal amounts with kb_absolute_morality kb_precision_(arithmetic) , meant that no round off was allowed .the rediscovery of the nepōhualtzintzin was due to the kb_mexican_people kb_civil_engineering kb_jacques-louis_david esparza kb_944_hidalgo , kb_world_health_organization in kb_histidine wanderings throughout kb_mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in kb_gold , jade , encrustations of kb_electron_shell , etc . there have also been found very kb_old_testament nepōhualtzintzin attributed to the kb_olmec kb_albanian_culture , and even some bracelets of mayan kb_evolution , as kb_water_well as kb_a diversity of kb_theory_of_forms and materials in kb_other_(philosophy) cultures .kb_lake_george_(new_york) i. sanchez , `` kb_arithmetic in kb_maya_civilization '' , austin-texas , 1961 found another kb_base_(chemistry) 5 , kb_base_(chemistry) 4 abacus in the kb_yucatán_peninsula kb_peninsula that also computed calendar kb_big_data . this was kb_a finger abacus , on kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_hand 0 , 1 , kb_alkaline_earth_metal , 3 , and 4 were used ; and on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand 0 , 1 , kb_alkaline_earth_metal and 3 were used . note the use of kb_0_(number) at kb_operation_barbarossa beginning and end of the kb_2_(number) kb_cycle_(graph_theory) . sanchez worked with kb_sylvanus_morley morley , kb_a noted mayanist .the kb_quipu of the incas was kb_a system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical kb_big_data , like advanced tally sticks – but not used to perform calculations . calculations were carried out using kb_a kb_yupana ( kb_quechua_languages for `` counting kb_tool '' ; kb_episcopal_see kb_female_body_shape ) which was still in use after the kb_umayyad_conquest_of_hispania of kb_peru . the working kb_principle_(chemistry) of kb_a kb_yupana is unknown , but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of these instruments was kb_anatolian_hypothesis by kb_italian_language kb_mathematician nicolino kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann pasquale . by comparing the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of several yupanas , researchers found that calculations were based using the kb_fibonacci_sequence sequencethe kb_russian_alphabet abacus , the `` schoty '' ( счёты ) , usually has kb_a kb_single_bond slanted deck , with ten beads on each wire ( except kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) wire , usually positioned near the kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) , with four beads for quarter-ruble kb_egyptian_fraction ) . older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks , which were minted until 1916. the kb_russian_alphabet abacus is often used kb_vertical_direction , with wires from kb_left_to_right kb_right-wing_politics in the manner of kb_a book . the wires are usually bowed to kb_bulge_(astronomy) upward in the center , to keep the beads pinned to either of the kb_2_(number) sides . kb_it is cleared when all the beads are moved to the kb_right-wing_politics . during manipulation , beads are moved to the kb_left-wing_politics . for easy viewing , the middle kb_alkaline_earth_metal beads on each wire ( the 5th and 6th bead ) usually are of kb_a different kb_color from the kb_other_(philosophy) eight beads . likewise , the kb_left-wing_politics bead of the thousands wire ( and the million wire , if present ) may have kb_a different kb_color .as kb_a kb_simple_polygon , cheap and reliable kb_analyzer , the kb_russian_alphabet abacus was in use in all shops and kb_market_(economics) throughout the kb_commonwealth_of_independent_states kb_soviet_union , and the usage of kb_it was taught in most schools until the 1990s . even the 1874 invention of kb_mechanical_calculator , kb_odhner_arithmometer arithmometer , had not replaced them in kb_russian_empire and likewise the kb_mass_production of felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the kb_soviet_union . the kb_russian_alphabet abacus began to lose popularity only after the kb_mass_production of kb_pocket_calculator had started in the kb_soviet_union in 1974. today kb_it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld kb_calculator .the kb_russian_alphabet abacus was brought to kb_france around 1820 by the kb_mathematician kb_jean-victor_poncelet poncelet , kb_world_health_organization served in kb_napoleon 's kb_british_army and had been kb_a prisoner of kb_war in kb_russian_empire . the abacus had fallen out of use in kb_western_europe in the 16th century with the rise of kb_decimal notation and algorismic methods . to poncelet 's kb_france contemporaries , kb_it was something kb_new_world . poncelet used kb_it , not for any kb_applied_science purpose , but as kb_a teaching and demonstration kb_aid . the kb_ottoman_empire and the kb_armenian_languagearound the kb_world_war_ii , abacuses have been used in pre-schools and kb_elementary_school schools as an kb_aid in teaching the kb_numeral_system system and kb_arithmetic .in kb_western_world , kb_a bead frame similar to the kb_russian_alphabet abacus but with straight wires and kb_a vertical frame has been common ( kb_episcopal_see image ) . kb_it is still often seen as kb_a kb_plastic or wooden toy .the wire frame may kb_beryllium used either with positional notation like kb_other_(philosophy) abacuses ( thus the 10-wire version may represent kb_grammatical_number up to 9,999,999,999 ) , or each bead may represent kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_units_of_measurement ( kb_sulfate that e.g . 74 can kb_beryllium represented by shifting all beads on 7 wires and 4 beads on the 8th wire , kb_sulfate kb_grammatical_number up to 100 may kb_beryllium represented ) . in the bead frame shown , the gap between the 5th and 6th wire , corresponding to the kb_color change between the 5th and the 6th bead on each wire , suggests the latter use .the red-and-white abacus is used in contemporary kb_primary_education schools for kb_a wide range of number-related lessons . the twenty bead version , referred to by its kb_dutch_language kb_toponymy `` rekenrek '' ( `` calculating frame '' ) , is often used , sometimes on kb_a string of beads , sometimes on kb_a kb_rigid_airship framework .by kb_learning how to calculate with abacus , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) can improve kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's kb_mental_health kb_calculation which becomes faster and more accurate in doing kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number calculations . kb_mental_abacus kb_mental_health kb_calculation ( amc ) was kb_derived_trait from the abacus which means doing kb_calculation , including kb_addition , kb_subtraction , kb_multiplication , and kb_division_(mathematics) , in kb_mind with an imagined abacus . kb_it is kb_a kb_high-level_programming_language cognitive skill that run through calculations with an effective kb_algorithm . kb_people_(american_magazine) doing long-term amc kb_military_education_and_training show higher numerical kb_memory capacity and have more effectively connected neural pathways . they are able to retrieve kb_memory to deal with kb_complex_number processes to calculate . the kb_fish_processing of amc involves both the kb_visuospatial_function and visuomotor kb_fish_processing which generate the visual abacus and perform the kb_movement_(sign_language) of the imaginary bead . since the only kb_object_(philosophy) needed to kb_beryllium remembered is the finial kb_positional_notation of beads , kb_it takes less kb_memory and less kb_computation kb_time_(magazine) .an adapted abacus , invented by tim cranmer , called kb_a cranmer abacus is still commonly used by individuals kb_world_health_organization are kb_blindness . kb_a piece of kb_hardness fabric or kb_rubber is placed behind the beads kb_sulfate that they do not move inadvertently . this keeps the beads in kb_place_of_articulation while the users kb_sentience or manipulate them . they use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions kb_multiplication , kb_division_(mathematics) , kb_addition , kb_subtraction , kb_square_root and kb_cube_root kb_root_of_a_function .although kb_blindness students have benefited from talking calculators , the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early kb_grade_(education) , both in kb_state_school schools and kb_state_of_matter schools for the kb_blindness . kb_blindness students also complete mathematical assignments using kb_a braille-writer and kb_nemeth_braille kb_code ( kb_a kb_type_(biology) of kb_braille kb_code for kb_mathematics ) but kb_prespa_lake kb_multiplication and kb_long_divisionthe kb_binary_number abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate kb_grammatical_number . the abacus shows how kb_grammatical_number ,

forming kb_a kb_covalent_bond with an kb_lone_pair ( kb_a kb_lewis_acid ) .the kb_first_trimester category of acids is the kb_proton donors or kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted acids . in the special case of kb_aqueous_solutions solutions , kb_proton donors kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_hydronium_ion kb_water and are known as kb_acid-base_reaction#arrhenius_theory acids . kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted and kb_thomas_martin_lowry generalized the arrhenius kb_theory to include non-aqueous solvents . kb_a kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted or arrhenius kb_acid usually contains kb_a kb_hydrogen_atom bonded to kb_a kb_chemical_structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of kb_hydrogen .aqueous kb_acid-base_reaction#arrhenius_theory acids have kb_characteristic_(algebra) kb_chemical_property which provide kb_a practical description of an kb_acid . acids kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_aqueous_solutions solutions with kb_a sour taste , can kb_turn_(geometry) blue kb_litmus kb_red_fox , and react with kb_base_(chemistry) and certain metals ( like kb_calcium ) to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_salt_(chemistry) . kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_acid '' is kb_derived_trait from the kb_latin `` acidus/acēre '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` sour '' . an kb_aqueous_solution kb_solid_solution of an kb_acid has kb_a kb_ph less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid ' ( as in 'dissolved in kb_acid ' ) , while the strict kb_definition refers only to the kb_solution . kb_a lower kb_ph means kb_a higher acidity , and thus kb_a higher kb_concentration of kb_hydron_(chemistry) kb_ions in the kb_solid_solution . kb_chemical_substance or substances having the kb_property of an kb_acid are said to kb_beryllium acidic .common aqueous acids include kb_hydrochloric_acid kb_acid ( kb_a kb_solid_solution of kb_hydrogen_chloride which is found in kb_gastric_acid kb_acid in the kb_stomach and activates kb_digestive_enzymes ) , acetic kb_acid ( kb_vinegar is kb_a dilute kb_aqueous_solution kb_solid_solution of this kb_liquid ) , kb_sulfuric_acid ( used in kb_car_batteries ) , and citric kb_acid ( found in citrus fruits ) . as these examples show , acids ( in the colloquial kb_word_sense ) can kb_beryllium solutions or pure substances , and can kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from acids ( in the strict kb_word_sense ) that are solids , liquids , or gases . kb_strong_nuclear_force acids and some concentrated weak acids are kb_corrosive_substance , but there are kb_non-linear_writing such as carboranes and kb_boric_acid kb_acid .the kb_second_language category of acids are kb_lewis_acids_and_bases , which kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_covalent_bond with an kb_lone_pair . an example is kb_boron_trifluoride ( bf ) , whose kb_boron kb_atom has kb_a vacant kb_atomic_orbital which can kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_covalent_bond by sharing kb_a kb_lone_pair pair of electrons on an kb_atom in kb_a kb_base_(chemistry) , for example the kb_nitrogen kb_atom in kb_ammonia ( nh ) . kb_meriwether_lewis considered this as kb_a generalization of the kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted kb_definition , kb_sulfate that an kb_acid is kb_a kb_protein_sequencing kb_species that accepts kb_electron pairs either directly `` or '' by releasing kb_protons ( kb_hydrogen ) into the kb_solid_solution , which then accept kb_electron pairs . however , kb_hydrogen_chloride , acetic kb_acid , and most kb_other_(philosophy) brønsted-lowry acids can not kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_covalent_bond with an kb_lone_pair and are therefore not kb_lewis_acids_and_bases . conversely , many kb_lewis_acids_and_bases are not arrhenius or brønsted-lowry acids . in kb_modern_history terminology , an `` kb_acid '' is implicitly kb_a kb_brønsted–lowry_acid–base_theory and not kb_a kb_lewis_acid , since chemists almost always refer to kb_a kb_lewis_acid explicitly as `` kb_a kb_lewis_acid '' .kb_modern_history definitions are concerned with the fundamental kb_protein_sequencing reactions common to all acids .most acids encountered in everyday kb_life_(magazine) are kb_aqueous_solutions solutions , or can kb_beryllium kb_fall_of_communism_in_albania in kb_water , kb_sulfate the arrhenius and brønsted-lowry definitions are the most relevant .the brønsted-lowry kb_definition is the most widely used kb_definition ; unless otherwise specified , acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of kb_a kb_proton ( kb_hydrogen ) from an kb_acid to kb_a kb_base_(chemistry) .kb_hydronium kb_ions are acids according to all kb_triliteral definitions . although alcohols and amines can kb_beryllium brønsted-lowry acids , they can also kb_function_(biology) as kb_meriwether_lewis kb_base_(chemistry)the kb_sweden chemist kb_svante_arrhenius arrhenius attributed the kb_chemical_property of acidity to kb_hydron_(chemistry) ( kb_hydrogen ) or kb_protons in 1884. an arrhenius kb_acid is kb_a kb_matter that , when added to kb_water , increases the kb_concentration of kb_hydrogen kb_ions in the kb_water . note that chemists often write kb_hydrogen ( `` aq '' ) and refer to the kb_hydrogen_ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free kb_hydrogen kb_atomic_nucleus , kb_a kb_proton , does not exist alone in kb_water , kb_it exists as the kb_hydronium_ion , kb_water . thus , an arrhenius kb_acid can also kb_beryllium described as kb_a kb_matter that increases the kb_concentration of kb_hydronium kb_ions when added to kb_water . examples include kb_molecular_genetics substances such as hcl and acetic kb_acid .an arrhenius kb_base_(chemistry) , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , is kb_a kb_matter which increases the kb_concentration of kb_lithium_hydroxide ( kb_hydroxide ) kb_ions when kb_fall_of_communism_in_albania in kb_water . this decreases the kb_concentration of kb_hydronium because the kb_ions react to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_water molecules :kb_water + kb_hydroxide ⇌ kb_water + kb_waterdue to this kb_chemical_equilibrium , any increase in the kb_concentration of kb_hydronium is accompanied by kb_a decrease in the kb_concentration of kb_lithium_hydroxide . thus , an arrhenius kb_acid could also kb_beryllium said to kb_beryllium kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) that decreases kb_lithium_hydroxide kb_concentration , while an arrhenius kb_base_(chemistry) increases kb_it .in an acidic kb_solid_solution , the kb_concentration of kb_hydronium kb_ions is greater than 10 kb_mole_(unit)while the arrhenius kb_concept is useful for describing many reactions , kb_it is also quite limited in its kb_scope_(mouthwash) . in 1923 chemists kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted nicolaus kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted and kb_thomas_martin_lowry kb_thomas_martin_lowry independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of kb_a kb_proton . kb_a brønsted-lowry kb_acid ( or simply kb_brønsted–lowry_acid–base_theory ) is kb_a kb_species that donates kb_a kb_proton to kb_a brønsted-lowry kb_base_(chemistry) . brønsted-lowry acid-base kb_theory has several advantages over arrhenius kb_theory . consider the following reactions of acetic kb_acid ( chcooh ) , the kb_organic_chemistry kb_acid that gives kb_vinegar its kb_characteristic_(algebra) taste :both kb_theories easily describe the kb_first_trimester reaction : chcooh acts as an arrhenius kb_acid because kb_it acts as kb_a source of kb_water when kb_fall_of_communism_in_albania in kb_water , and kb_it acts as kb_a kb_brønsted–lowry_acid–base_theory by donating kb_a kb_proton to kb_water . in the kb_second_language example chcooh undergoes the same transformation , in this case donating kb_a kb_proton to kb_ammonia ( nh ) , but does not relate to the arrhenius kb_definition of an kb_acid because the reaction does not produce kb_hydronium . nevertheless , chcooh is both an arrhenius and kb_a brønsted-lowry kb_acid .brønsted-lowry kb_theory can kb_beryllium used to describe reactions of kb_molecule in nonaqueous kb_solid_solution or the kb_gas kb_phase_(matter) . kb_hydrogen_chloride ( hcl ) and kb_ammonia combine under several different conditions to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_ammonium_chloride , nhcl . in kb_aqueous_solution kb_solid_solution hcl behaves as kb_hydrochloric_acid kb_acid and exists as kb_hydronium and kb_chloride kb_ions . the following reactions illustrate the limitations of arrhenius 's kb_definition :as with the acetic kb_acid reactions , both definitions kb_cold_working for the kb_first_trimester example , where kb_water is the kb_solvent and kb_hydronium_ion is formed by the hcl kb_solution . the kb_next kb_2_(number) reactions do not involve the formation of kb_ions but are still proton-transfer reactions . in the kb_second_language reaction kb_hydrogen_chloride and kb_ammonia ( kb_fall_of_communism_in_albania in kb_benzene ) react to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_solid kb_ammonium_chloride in kb_a kb_benzene kb_solvent and in the kb_ipad_(third_generation) gaseous hcl and nh combine to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_solid .kb_a kb_ipad_(third_generation) , only marginally related kb_concept was kb_anatolian_hypothesis in 1923 by kb_gilbert_n._lewis kb_noun kb_meriwether_lewis , which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve kb_a kb_proton transfer . kb_a kb_lewis_acid is kb_a kb_species that accepts kb_a pair of electrons from another kb_species ; in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_lexical_semantics , kb_it is an kb_lone_pair acceptor . kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted acid-base reactions are kb_proton transfer reactions while kb_meriwether_lewis acid-base reactions are kb_lone_pair transfers . many kb_lewis_acids_and_bases are not brønsted-lowry acids . kb_contrast_(vision) how the following reactions are described in terms of kb_acid-base_chemistry kb_chemistry :in the kb_first_trimester reaction kb_a kb_fluoride , kb_fluorine , gives up an kb_lone_pair to kb_boron_trifluoride to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_decay_product kb_tetrafluoroborate . kb_fluoride `` loses '' kb_a pair of valence electrons because the electrons shared in the b—f kb_chemical_bond are located in the kb_region of kb_space between the kb_2_(number) kb_atomic_nucleus and are therefore more distant from the kb_fluoride kb_atomic_nucleus than they are in the lone kb_fluoride . bf is kb_a kb_lewis_acid because kb_it accepts the kb_lone_pair from kb_fluoride . this reaction can not kb_beryllium described in terms of kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted kb_theory because there is no kb_proton transfer . the kb_second_language reaction can kb_beryllium described using either kb_theory . kb_a kb_proton is transferred from an unspecified kb_brønsted–lowry_acid–base_theory to kb_ammonia , kb_a kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted kb_base_(chemistry) ; alternatively , kb_ammonia acts as kb_a kb_lewis_base and transfers kb_a kb_lone_pair pair of electrons to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_chemical_bond with kb_a kb_hydrogen_ion . the kb_species that gains the kb_lone_pair is the kb_lewis_acid ; for example , the kb_oxygen kb_atom in kb_water gains kb_a pair of electrons when kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the h—o bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the kb_chemical_bond become localized on kb_oxygen . depending on the kb_context_(language_use) , kb_a kb_lewis_acid may also kb_beryllium described as an kb_nitrogen_tetroxide or an kb_electrophile . kb_organic_chemistry kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted acids , such as acetic , citric , or oxalic kb_acid , are not kb_lewis_acids_and_bases . they dissociate in kb_water to produce kb_a kb_lewis_acid , kb_hydrogen , but at the same kb_time_(magazine) also yield an equal amount of kb_a kb_lewis_base ( kb_acetate , kb_citrate , or kb_oxalate , respectively , for the acids mentioned ) . few , if any , of the acids discussed in the following are kb_lewis_acids_and_bases .reactions of acids are often generalized in the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism ha kb_hydrogen + kb_a , where ha represents the kb_acid and kb_a is the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) . this reaction is referred to as protolysis . the kb_protonated kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism ( ha ) of an kb_acid is also sometimes referred to as the free kb_acid .acid-base conjugate pairs differ by kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton , and can kb_beryllium interconverted by the kb_addition or removal of kb_a kb_proton ( kb_protonation and kb_deprotonation , respectively ) . note that the kb_acid can kb_beryllium the kb_electric_charge kb_species and the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) can kb_beryllium kb_neutral_solution in which case the generalized reaction scheme could kb_beryllium written as ha kb_hydrogen + a. in kb_solid_solution there exists an kb_chemical_equilibrium between the kb_acid and its kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) . the kb_equilibrium_constant `` kb_potassium '' is an expression of the kb_chemical_equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the kb_ions in kb_solid_solution . brackets indicate kb_concentration , such that [ kb_water ] means `` the kb_concentration of kb_water '' . the kb_acid_dissociation_constant constant `` kb_potassium '' is generally used in the kb_context_(language_use) of acid-base reactions . the numerical kb_lightness of `` kb_potassium '' is equal to the kb_decay_product of the concentrations of the products divided by the kb_concentration of the reactants , where the reactant is the kb_acid ( ha ) and the products are the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) and kb_hydrogen .the stronger of kb_2_(number) acids kb_will_and_testament have kb_a higher `` kb_potassium '' than the weaker kb_acid ; the kb_ratio of kb_hydron_(chemistry) to kb_acid kb_will_and_testament kb_beryllium higher for the stronger kb_acid as the stronger kb_acid has kb_a greater tendency to lose its kb_proton . because the range of possible values for `` kb_potassium '' spans many kb_order_(biology) of kb_apparent_magnitude , kb_a more manageable constant , p '' kb_potassium '' is more frequently used , where p '' kb_potassium '' = −log `` kb_potassium '' . stronger acids have kb_a smaller p '' kb_potassium '' than weaker acids . experimentally determined p '' kb_potassium '' at 25 °c in kb_aqueous_solution kb_solid_solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference kb_material .in the kb_classical_conditioning naming system , acids are kb_english_alphabet#letter_names according to their anions . that kb_ionic_crystal kb_suffix is dropped and replaced with kb_a kb_new_world kb_suffix ( and sometimes kb_prefix ) , according to the table kb_#ecclesiastical_history .for example , hcl has kb_chloride as its kb_anion , kb_sulfate the -ide kb_suffix makes kb_it kb_take the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_hydrochloric_acid kb_acid . in the kb_international_union_of_pure_and_applied_chemistry naming system , `` aqueous '' is simply added to the kb_toponymy of the kb_ionic_compound . thus , for kb_hydrogen_chloride , the kb_international_union_of_pure_and_applied_chemistry kb_toponymy would kb_beryllium aqueous kb_hydrogen_chloride . the kb_prefix `` hydro- '' is added only if the kb_acid is made up of just kb_hydrogen and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_other_(philosophy) kb_chemical_element .kb_classical_conditioning naming system :the kb_strength_of_materials of an kb_acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose kb_a kb_proton . kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_acid is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) that completely dissociates in kb_water ; in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_lexical_semantics , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_mole_(unit) of kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_acid ha kb_dissolve_(filmmaking) in kb_water yielding kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_mole_(unit) of kb_hydrogen and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_mole_(unit) of the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) , kb_a , and kb_none_(liturgy) of the kb_protonated kb_acid ha . in kb_contrast_(vision) , kb_a kb_weak_acid kb_acid only partially dissociates and at kb_chemical_equilibrium both the kb_acid and the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) are in kb_solid_solution . examples of kb_strong_nuclear_force acids are kb_hydrochloric_acid kb_acid ( hcl ) , kb_hydroiodic_acid kb_acid ( hi ) , kb_hydrobromic_acid kb_acid ( hbr ) , kb_perchloric_acid kb_acid ( hclo ) , kb_nitric_acid kb_acid ( hno ) and kb_sulfuric_acid ( hso ) . in kb_water each of these essentially ionizes 100 % . the stronger an kb_acid is , the more easily kb_it loses kb_a kb_proton , h. kb_2_(number) kb_key_(cryptography) factors that contribute to the ease of kb_deprotonation are the kb_chemical_polarity of the h—a kb_chemical_bond and the size of kb_atom kb_a , which determines the kb_strength_of_materials of the h—a kb_chemical_bond . kb_acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) .stronger acids have kb_a larger `` kb_potassium '' and kb_a more kb_negative_number p '' kb_potassium '' than weaker acids .sulfonic acids , which are kb_organic_chemistry oxyacids , are kb_a kb_class_(biology) of kb_strong_nuclear_force acids . kb_a common example is kb_toluenesulfonic_acid kb_acid ( tosylic kb_acid ) . unlike kb_sulfuric_acid itself , sulfonic acids can kb_beryllium solids . in kb_fact , kb_polystyrene functionalized into kb_polystyrene sulfonate is kb_a kb_solid strongly acidic kb_plastic that is filterable .superacids are acids stronger than 100 % kb_sulfuric_acid . examples of superacids are kb_fluoroantimonic_acid kb_acid , kb_magic_(supernatural) kb_acid and kb_perchloric_acid kb_acid . superacids can permanently protonate kb_water to give kb_ionic_crystal , crystalline kb_hydronium `` kb_salt_(chemistry) '' . they can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations .while `` kb_potassium '' measures the kb_strength_of_materials of an kb_acid kb_chemical_compound , the kb_strength_of_materials of an aqueous kb_acid kb_solid_solution is measured by kb_ph , which is an indication of the kb_concentration of kb_hydronium in the kb_solid_solution . the kb_ph of kb_a kb_simple_polygon kb_solid_solution of an kb_acid kb_chemical_compound in kb_water is determined by the dilution of the kb_chemical_compound and the kb_chemical_compound 's `` kb_potassium '' .monoprotic acids , also known as monobasic acids , are those acids that are able to donate kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton per kb_molecule during the process of kb_dissociation_(chemistry) ( sometimes called kb_ionization ) as shown kb_#ecclesiastical_history ( symbolized by ha ) :common examples of monoprotic acids in kb_mineral_reserve acids include kb_hydrochloric_acid kb_acid ( hcl ) and kb_nitric_acid kb_acid ( hno ) . on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , for kb_organic_acids the kb_terminology mainly indicates the presence of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_carboxylic_acid kb_acid kb_group_(periodic_table) and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic kb_acid . examples in kb_organic_acids include kb_formic_acid kb_acid ( hcooh ) , acetic kb_acid ( chcooh ) and kb_benzoic_acid kb_acid ( chcooh ) .polyprotic acids , also known as polybasic acids , are able to donate more than kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton per kb_acid kb_molecule , in kb_contrast_(vision) to monoprotic acids that only donate kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton per kb_molecule . specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names , such as diprotic ( or dibasic ) kb_acid ( kb_2_(number) potential kb_protons to donate ) , and triprotic ( or tribasic ) kb_acid ( kb_triliteral potential kb_protons to donate ) .kb_a diprotic kb_acid ( here symbolized by ha ) can undergo kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or kb_2_(number) dissociations depending on the kb_ph . each kb_dissociation_(chemistry) has its own kb_dissociation_(chemistry) constant , kb_potassium and kb_potassium .the kb_first_trimester kb_dissociation_(chemistry) constant is typically greater than the kb_second_language ; i.e. , `` kb_potassium '' > `` kb_potassium '' . for example , kb_sulfuric_acid ( hso ) can donate kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_bisulfate kb_anion ( hso ) , for which `` kb_potassium '' is very kb_prespa_lake ; then kb_it can donate kb_a kb_second_language kb_proton to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_sulfate kb_anion ( kb_sulfate ) , wherein the `` kb_potassium '' is intermediate kb_strength_of_materials . the kb_prespa_lake `` kb_potassium '' for the kb_first_trimester kb_dissociation_(chemistry) makes kb_sulfuric_acid kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_acid . in kb_a similar manner , the weak unstable kb_carbonic_acid kb_acid can lose kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_bicarbonate kb_anion and lose kb_a kb_second_language to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_lithium_carbonate kb_anion ( kb_cobalt ) . both `` kb_potassium '' values are small , but `` kb_potassium '' > `` kb_potassium '' .kb_a triprotic kb_acid ( ha ) can undergo kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) , kb_2_(number) , or kb_triliteral dissociations and has kb_triliteral kb_dissociation_(chemistry) constants , where `` kb_potassium '' > `` kb_potassium '' > `` kb_potassium '' .an kb_inorganic example of kb_a triprotic kb_acid is orthophosphoric kb_acid ( hpo ) , usually just called kb_phosphoric_acid kb_acid . all kb_triliteral kb_protons can kb_beryllium successively kb_lost_film to yield hpo , then hpo , and finally kb_po_(river) , the orthophosphate kb_ion , usually just called kb_phosphate . even though the positions of the kb_triliteral kb_protons on the original kb_phosphoric_acid kb_acid kb_molecule are kb_cognate , the successive `` kb_potassium '' values differ since kb_it is energetically less favorable to lose kb_a kb_proton if the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) is more negatively kb_electric_charge . an kb_organic_chemistry example of kb_a triprotic kb_acid is citric kb_acid , which can successively lose kb_triliteral kb_protons to finally kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_citrate kb_ion .although the subsequent loss of each kb_hydrogen_ion is less favorable , all of the conjugate kb_base_(chemistry) are present in kb_solid_solution . the fractional kb_concentration , `` α '' ( kb_alpha_(letter) ) , for each kb_species can kb_beryllium calculated . for example , kb_a kb_genus diprotic kb_acid kb_will_and_testament generate 3 kb_species in kb_solid_solution : ha , ha , and a. the fractional concentrations can kb_beryllium calculated as kb_#ecclesiastical_history when given either the kb_ph ( which can kb_beryllium converted to the [ kb_hydrogen ] ) or the concentrations of the kb_acid with all its conjugate kb_base_(chemistry) :kb_a plot of these fractional concentrations against kb_ph , for given `` kb_potassium '' and `` kb_potassium '' , is known as kb_a kb_bjerrum_plot plotcategory : acid–base kb_chemistrykb_asphalt , also known as kb_asphalt ( , ) , is kb_a sticky , kb_black_sea , and highly kb_viscosity kb_liquid or semi-solid kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_petroleum . kb_it may kb_beryllium found in kb_natural_number kb_deposit_(geology) or may kb_beryllium kb_a refined kb_decay_product , and is kb_axon#classification as kb_a kb_pitch_(flight) . before the 20th century , the kb_terminology asphaltum was also used . kb_the_word_(free_love) word is kb_derived_trait from the kb_ancient_greek ἄσφαλτος `` ásphaltos '' .the kb_primary_education use ( 70 % ) of kb_asphalt is in kb_road_surface kb_construction , where kb_it is used as the glue or kb_binder_(material) mixed with kb_construction_aggregate kb_subatomic_particle to create kb_asphalt_concrete . its kb_other_(philosophy) main uses are for kb_bituminous_waterproofing kb_waterproofing products , including production of kb_roofing_felt felt and for sealing flat roofs .the terms `` kb_asphalt '' and `` kb_asphalt '' are often used interchangeably to kb_mean both kb_natural_number and manufactured kb_theory_of_forms of the kb_matter . in kb_american_english , `` kb_asphalt '' ( or `` kb_asphalt kb_cement '' ) is commonly used for kb_a refined residue from the kb_distillation process of selected crude kb_cooking_oil . outside the united kb_sovereign_state , the kb_decay_product is often called `` kb_asphalt '' , and geologists worldwide often prefer the kb_terminology for the naturally occurring kb_variety_(magazine) . common colloquial usage often refers to various kb_theory_of_forms of kb_asphalt as `` kb_tar '' , as in the kb_toponymy of the kb_la_brea_tar_pits brea kb_tar pits .naturally occurring kb_asphalt is sometimes specified by the kb_terminology `` crude kb_asphalt '' . its kb_viscosity is similar to that of cold kb_molasses while the kb_material obtained from the kb_fractional_distillation kb_distillation of kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil boiling at is sometimes referred to as `` refined kb_asphalt '' . the kb_canadians kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands of kb_alberta has most of the kb_world_war_ii 's reserves of kb_natural_number kb_asphalt in the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands , which cover , an kb_area larger than kb_kingdom_of_england .kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_asphalt '' is kb_derived_trait from the late kb_middle_english kb_australian_english , in kb_turn_(geometry) from kb_france `` asphalte '' , based on kb_late_latin kb_latin `` asphalton '' , `` asphaltum '' , which is the kb_latinisation_(literature) of the kb_ancient_greek ἄσφαλτος ( `` ásphaltos '' , `` ásphalton '' ) , kb_a word kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` asphalt/bitumen/pitch '' , which perhaps derives from ἀ- , `` without '' and σφάλλω ( `` sfallō '' ) , `` make fall '' . the kb_first_trimester use of kb_asphalt by the ancients was in the kb_nature of kb_a kb_cement for securing or joining together various kb_object_relations_theory , and kb_it thus seems likely that the kb_toponymy itself was kb_keyboard_expression of this kb_application_(computing) . specifically , kb_herodotus mentioned that kb_asphalt was brought to kb_babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall . from the kb_ancient_greek , kb_the_word_(free_love) word passed into kb_late_latin kb_latin , and thence into kb_france ( `` asphalte '' ) and kb_australian_english ( `` asphaltum '' and `` kb_asphalt '' ) . in kb_france , the kb_terminology `` asphalte '' is used for naturally occurring asphalt-soaked kb_limestone kb_deposit_(geology) , and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater kb_asphalt content than the `` asphaltic kb_concrete '' used to pave roads .the expression `` kb_asphalt '' originated in the kb_sanskrit kb_lexical_semantics `` jatu '' , kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_pitch_(flight) '' , and `` jatu-krit '' , kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_pitch_(flight) creating '' or `` kb_pitch_(flight) producing '' ( referring to kb_temperate_coniferous_forest or resinous kb_trees ) . the kb_latin kb_cognate is claimed by some to kb_beryllium originally `` gwitu-men '' ( pertaining to kb_pitch_(flight) ) , and by others , `` pixtumens '' ( exuding or bubbling kb_pitch_(flight) ) , which was subsequently kb_clipping_(morphology) to `` kb_asphalt '' , thence passing via kb_france into kb_australian_english . from the same kb_root_of_a_function is kb_derived_trait the kb_anglo-saxons word `` cwidu '' ( mastix ) , the kb_german_language word `` kitt '' ( kb_cement or kb_mastic_(plant_resin) ) and the kb_old_norse word `` kvada '' .in kb_british_english , `` kb_asphalt '' is used instead of `` kb_asphalt '' . kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_asphalt '' is instead used to refer to kb_asphalt_concrete , kb_a kb_mixture of kb_construction_aggregate and kb_asphalt itself ( also called `` kb_tarmacadam '' in common parlance ) . kb_asphalt mixed with kb_clay was usually called `` asphaltum '' , but the kb_terminology is less commonly used today .in kb_australian_english kb_australian_english , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_asphalt '' is used to describe kb_a mix of kb_construction_aggregate . `` kb_asphalt '' refers to the kb_liquid kb_derived_trait from the heavy-residues from kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil kb_distillation .in kb_american_english , `` kb_asphalt '' is kb_cognate to the kb_kingdom_of_great_britain `` kb_asphalt '' . however , `` kb_asphalt '' is also commonly used as kb_a kb_clipping_(morphology) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of `` kb_asphalt_concrete '' ( therefore kb_cognate to the kb_kingdom_of_great_britain `` kb_asphalt '' or `` kb_tarmacadam '' ) .in kb_canadian_english , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_asphalt '' is used to refer to the vast kb_canadians kb_deposit_(geology) of extremely heavy kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , while `` kb_asphalt '' is used for the kb_oil_refinery kb_decay_product . diluted kb_asphalt ( diluted with kb_naphtha to make kb_it kb_flow_(psychology) in pipelines ) is known as `` kb_dilbit '' in the kb_canadians kb_petroleum kb_industry , while kb_asphalt `` kb_upgrader '' to kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil is known as `` syncrude '' , and syncrude blended with kb_asphalt is called `` kb_synbit '' .`` kb_asphalt '' is still the preferred kb_geological kb_terminology for naturally occurring kb_deposit_(geology) of the kb_solid or semi-solid kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_petroleum . `` bituminous kb_rock_of_gibraltar '' is kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_sandstone impregnated with kb_asphalt . the kb_oil_sands of kb_alberta , kb_canada are kb_a similar kb_material .neither of the terms `` kb_asphalt '' or `` kb_asphalt '' should kb_beryllium confused with kb_tar or kb_coal_tars . kb_tar is the thick kb_liquid kb_decay_product of the dry kb_distillation and kb_pyrolysis of kb_organic_chemistry kb_hydrocarbons primarily sourced from vegetation masses , whether fossilized as with kb_coal , or freshly harvested . the majority of kb_asphalt , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , was formed naturally when vast quantities of kb_organic_chemistry kb_animal materials were deposited by kb_water and buried hundreds of metres deep at the kb_diagenesis point , where the disorganized fatty kb_hydrocarbon molecules joined together in kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) chains in the absence of kb_oxygen . kb_asphalt occurs as kb_a kb_solid or highly kb_viscosity kb_liquid . kb_it may even kb_beryllium mixed in with kb_coal kb_deposit_(geology) . kb_asphalt , and kb_coal using the kb_bergius_process process , can kb_beryllium refined into petrols such as kb_gasoline , and kb_asphalt may kb_beryllium distilled into kb_tar , not the kb_other_(philosophy) way around .the components of kb_asphalt include four main classes of kb_chemical_compound :the naphthene aromatics and kb_polar_molecule aromatics are typically the majority components . most kb_natural_number bitumens also contain organosulfur kb_chemical_compound , resulting in an overall kb_sulfur content of up to 4 % . kb_nickel and kb_vanadium are found at < 10 kb_part_per_million per million , as is typical of some kb_petroleum .the kb_matter is kb_solubility in kb_carbon_disulfide . kb_it is commonly modelled as kb_a kb_colloid , with asphaltenes as the kb_continuous_function kb_phase_(matter) . `` kb_it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of kb_asphalt , because the kb_grammatical_number of molecules with different kb_chemical_structure is extremely kb_prespa_lake '' .kb_asphalt may kb_beryllium confused with kb_coal_tar , which is kb_a visually similar kb_black_sea , kb_thermoplastic kb_material produced by the kb_destructive_distillation kb_distillation of kb_coal . during the early and mid-20th century , when kb_town_gas kb_gas was produced , kb_coal_tar was kb_a readily kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance byproduct and extensively used as the kb_binder_(material) for road kb_construction_aggregate . the kb_addition of kb_coal_tar to kb_macadam roads kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_tarmacadam '' , which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials . however , since the 1970s , when kb_natural_gas succeeded kb_town_gas kb_gas , kb_asphalt has completely overtaken the use of kb_coal_tar in these applications . kb_other_(philosophy) examples of this kb_confusion include the kb_la_brea_tar_pits brea kb_tar pits and the kb_canadians kb_oil_sands , both of which actually contain kb_natural_number kb_asphalt rather than kb_tar . `` kb_pitch_(flight) '' is another kb_terminology sometimes informally used at times to refer to kb_asphalt , as in kb_pitch_lake .for kb_economic_anthropology and kb_other_(philosophy) reasons , kb_asphalt is sometimes sold combined with kb_other_(philosophy) materials , often without kb_being labeled as anything kb_other_(philosophy) than simply `` kb_asphalt '' .of kb_particular note , in the 21st century , is the use of re-refined kb_engine kb_palm_oil bottoms -- `` reob '' or `` reobs '' —the residue of kb_automotive_oil_recycling kb_engine kb_palm_oil , collected from the bottoms of re-refining kb_vacuum_distillation towers . kb_it contains the various non-refined kb_chemical_element and kb_chemical_compound in kb_recycling kb_engine kb_palm_oil , leftover from the re-refining process—both additives to the original kb_palm_oil , and materials accumulating from its circulation in the kb_engine ( typically kb_iron and kb_copperthe majority of kb_asphalt used commercially is obtained from kb_petroleum . nonetheless , kb_prespa_lake amounts of kb_asphalt occur in concentrated kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism in kb_nature . naturally occurring kb_deposit_(geology) of kb_asphalt are formed from the remains of kb_ancient_history , kb_microscopic_scale kb_algae ( diatoms ) and kb_other_(philosophy) once-living things . these remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the kb_oceanus or kb_lake_of_fire where the organisms lived . under the kb_heat_(1972_film) ( above 50 °c ) and kb_pressure of burial deep in the kb_earth , the remains were transformed into materials such as kb_asphalt , kb_kerogen , or kb_petroleum .kb_natural_number kb_deposit_(geology) of kb_asphalt include kb_list_of_lakes_in_alberta such as the kb_pitch_lake in kb_trinidad and kb_invasion_of_tobago and kb_lake_bermudez in kb_venezuela . kb_natural_number kb_petroleum_seep occur in the kb_la_brea_tar_pits brea kb_tar pits and in the kb_dead_sea kb_sea_(astronomy) .kb_asphalt also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as `` kb_oil_sands '' in kb_alberta , kb_canada , and the similar `` kb_tar sands '' in kb_utah , kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) .the kb_canadians kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands of kb_alberta has most of the kb_world_war_ii 's reserves , in kb_triliteral huge kb_deposit_(geology) covering , an kb_area larger than kb_kingdom_of_england or kb_new_york_state . these bituminous sands contain of commercially established kb_patos-marinza_oil_field , giving kb_canada the kb_ipad_(third_generation) kb_largest_organisms kb_patos-marinza_oil_field in the kb_world_war_ii . although kb_history kb_it was used without refining to pave roads , nearly all of the output is now used as kb_raw_material kb_material for kb_oil_refinery in kb_canada and the united kb_sovereign_state .the kb_world_war_ii 's kb_largest_organisms deposit of kb_natural_number kb_asphalt , known as the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands , is located in the kb_mcmurray_formation formation of kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta . this formation is from the early kb_cretaceous , and is composed of numerous kb_lens_(optics) of oil-bearing kb_sand with up to 20 % kb_palm_oil . isotopic studies show the kb_palm_oil kb_deposit_(geology) to kb_beryllium about 110 million years kb_old_testament . kb_2_(number) smaller but still very kb_prespa_lake kb_geological_formation occur in the kb_peace_river_oil_sands sands and the kb_cold_lake_oil_sands kb_lake_of_fire kb_oil_sands , to the kb_western_culture and kb_albanian_ohrid_lake_coast of the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands , respectively . of the kb_alberta kb_deposit_(geology) , only parts of the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands are shallow enough to kb_beryllium suitable for kb_surface_mining . the kb_other_(philosophy) 80 % has to kb_beryllium produced by kb_palm_oil kb_water_well using kb_enhanced_oil_recovery kb_palm_oil recovery techniques like kb_steam-assisted_gravity_drainage kb_gravity_(2013_film) drainage .much smaller kb_heavy_crude_oil kb_palm_oil or kb_asphalt kb_deposit_(geology) also occur in the kb_uinta_basin basin in kb_utah , kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) . the kb_tar_sand_triangle kb_triangle_(musical_instrument) deposit , for example , is roughly 6 % kb_asphalt .kb_asphalt may occur in hydrothermal veins . an example of this is within the kb_uinta_basin basin of kb_utah , in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , where there is kb_a swarm of laterally and kb_vertical_direction extensive veins composed of kb_a kb_solid kb_hydrocarbon termed kb_gilsonite . these veins formed by the kb_polymerization and solidification of kb_hydrocarbons that were mobilized from the deeper kb_palm_oil shales of the kb_green_river_formation formation during burial and kb_diagenesis .kb_asphalt is similar to the kb_organic_chemistry kb_matter in carbonaceous meteorites . however , detailed studies have shown these materials to kb_beryllium distinct . the vast kb_alberta kb_asphalt resources are considered to have started out as living kb_material from kb_ocean plants and kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing , mainly kb_algae , that died millions of years ago when an kb_ancient_history kb_oceanus covered kb_alberta . they were covered by mud , buried deeply over kb_time_(magazine) , and gently cooked into kb_palm_oil by geothermal kb_heat_(1972_film) at kb_a kb_temperature of . due to kb_pressure from the rising of the kb_rocky_mountains mountains in southwestern kb_alberta , 80 to 55 million years ago , the kb_palm_oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres and trapped into underground kb_sand kb_deposit_(geology) kb_left_behind by kb_ancient_history kb_river beds and kb_oceanus beaches , thus forming the kb_oil_sands .the use of kb_natural_number kb_asphalt for kb_waterproofing , and as an kb_adhesive dates at least to the fifth kb_millennium bc , with kb_a kb_crop storage basket discovered in kb_mehrgarh , of the kb_indus_valley_civilization , lined with kb_it . by the 3rd kb_millennium bc refined kb_rock_of_gibraltar kb_asphalt was in use in the kb_region , and was used to waterproof the kb_great_bath,_mohenjo-daro kb_bath,_somerset in mohenjo-daro .in the kb_ancient_history kb_middle_east kb_east_africa , the sumerians used kb_natural_number kb_asphalt kb_deposit_(geology) for kb_mortar_(masonry) between bricks and stones , to kb_cement parts of carvings , such as eyes , into kb_place_of_articulation , for kb_spacecraft kb_caulking , and for kb_waterproofing . the kb_ancient_greek historian kb_herodotus said hot kb_asphalt was used as kb_mortar_(masonry) in the walls of kb_babylon .the kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_euphrates_tunnel beneath the kb_river kb_euphrates at kb_babylon in the kb_time_(magazine) of queen kb_semiramis ( ca . 800 bc ) was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with kb_asphalt as kb_a kb_waterproofing agent .kb_asphalt was used by kb_ancient_history kb_egyptians to kb_embalming mummies . the kb_persian_alphabet word for kb_asphalt is `` moom '' , which is related to the kb_australian_english word kb_mummy . the kb_egyptians ' kb_primary_education source of kb_asphalt was the kb_dead_sea kb_sea_(astronomy) , which kb_ancient_rome kb_roman_empire knew as `` palus asphaltites '' ( kb_asphalt kb_lake_of_fire ) .in approximately 40 kb_anno_domini , kb_dioscorides described the kb_dead_sea kb_sea_(astronomy) kb_material as `` judaicum kb_asphalt '' , and noted kb_other_(philosophy) places in the kb_region where kb_it could kb_beryllium found .the kb_sidon kb_asphalt is thought to refer to kb_material found at kb_hasbeya in kb_lebanon . kb_pliny_the_elder also refers to kb_asphalt kb_being found in kb_epirus_(ancient_state) . kb_asphalt was kb_a valuable kb_geostrategy resource . kb_it was the kb_space_debris of the kb_first_trimester known kb_battle_abbey for kb_a kb_hydrocarbon deposit — between the kb_seleucids and the kb_nabateans in 312 bc .in the kb_ancient_history kb_chinese_alchemy kb_east_africa , kb_natural_number kb_asphalt was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher kb_egyptian_fraction , leaving kb_a kb_thermoplastic kb_material of higher kb_molecular_weight that when layered on kb_object_relations_theory became quite hard upon cooling . this was used to cover kb_object_relations_theory that needed kb_waterproofing , such as scabbards and kb_other_(philosophy) items . kb_statuettes of kb_household kb_deities were also kb_casting_(metalworking) with this kb_type_(biology) of kb_material in kb_japan , and probably also in kb_china .in kb_north_america , kb_archaeology recovery has indicated that kb_asphalt was sometimes used to adhere stone kb_projectile points to wooden shafts . in kb_canada , kb_australian_aborigine kb_people_(american_magazine) used kb_asphalt seeping out of the banks of the kb_athabasca_river and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_list_of_rivers_of_alberta to waterproof birch bark canoes , and also heated kb_it in smudge pots to ward off mosquitoes in the summer .in 1553 , kb_pierre_belon belon described in kb_histidine kb_cold_working `` kb_observations_(pierre_belon) '' that `` pissasphalto '' , kb_a kb_mixture of kb_pitch_(flight) and kb_asphalt , was used in the kb_republic_of_ragusa ragusa ( now kb_dubrovnik , kb_croatia ) for tarring of ships .an 1838 edition of `` kb_mechanics magazine '' cites an early use of kb_asphalt in kb_france . kb_a pamphlet dated 1621 , by `` kb_a certain monsieur d'eyrinys , kb_sovereign_state that kb_he_(letter) had discovered the kb_existence ( of asphaltum ) in kb_prespa_lake quantities in the vicinity of neufchatel '' , and that kb_he_(letter) kb_anatolian_hypothesis to use kb_it in kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of ways – `` principally in the kb_construction of air-proof kb_granary , and in protecting , by means of the arches , the water-courses in kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth '' , which at that kb_time_(magazine) made the kb_water unusable . `` kb_he_(letter) expatiates also on the excellence of this kb_material for forming level and durable terraces '' in palaces , `` the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) likely to cross the kb_brain of kb_a parisian of that generation '' .but the kb_matter was generally neglected in kb_france until the kb_french_revolution of 1830. in the 1830s there was kb_a surge of kb_interest , and kb_asphalt became widely used `` for pavements , flat roofs , and the lining of cisterns , and in kb_kingdom_of_england , some use of kb_it had been made of kb_it for similar purposes '' . its rise in kb_europe was `` kb_a sudden phenomenon '' , after kb_natural_number kb_deposit_(geology) were found `` in kb_france at osbann ( kb_bas-rhin ) , the parc ( kb_ain ) and the puy-de-la-poix ( kb_puy-de-dôme ) '' , although kb_it could also kb_beryllium made artificially . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century uses in kb_france was the laying of about 24,000 kb_square yards of seyssel kb_asphalt at the kb_place_de_la_concorde la concorde in 1835 .among the kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet uses of kb_asphalt in the kb_united_kingdom kb_kingdom_(biology) was for etching . william kb_salmon 's `` polygraphice '' ( 1673 ) provides kb_a recipe for kb_varnish used in etching , consisting of kb_triliteral ounces of virgin kb_beeswax , kb_2_(number) ounces of kb_mastic_(plant_resin) , and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) ounce of asphaltum . by the fifth edition in 1685 , kb_he_(letter) had included more asphaltum recipes from kb_other_(philosophy) sources .the kb_first_trimester kb_kingdom_of_great_britain kb_patent for the use of kb_asphalt was `` cassell 's kb_patent asphalte or kb_asphalt '' in 1834. then on 25 november 1837 , kb_captain_r._t._claridge tappin claridge kb_patented the use of seyssel kb_asphalt ( kb_patent # 7849 ) , for use in asphalte kb_road_surface , having seen kb_it employed in kb_france and kb_belgium when visiting with kb_frederick_walter_simms walter simms , kb_world_health_organization worked with him on the introduction of kb_asphalt to kb_great_britain . dr t. kb_lamb_and_mutton phipson writes that kb_histidine kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , kb_samuel ryland phipson , kb_a friend of claridge , was also `` instrumental in introducing the asphalte kb_road_surface ( in 1836 ) '' . indeed , kb_mastic_(plant_resin) pavements had been previously employed at kb_vauxhall by kb_a competitor of claridge , but without success .claridge obtained kb_a kb_patent in kb_scottish_episcopal_church on 27 kb_march 1838 , and obtained kb_a kb_patent in kb_ireland on 23 april 1838. in 1851 , extensions for the 1837 kb_patent and for both 1838 patents were sought by the trustees of kb_a company previously formed by claridge . `` claridge 's kb_patent asphalte company '' —formed in 1838 for the purpose of introducing to kb_great_britain `` asphalte in its kb_natural_number kb_state_of_matter from the mine at pyrimont seysell in kb_france '' , — '' laid kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester kb_asphalt pavements in whitehall '' . trials were made of the kb_road_surface in 1838 on the footway in whitehall , the stable at knightsbridge barracks , `` and subsequently on the kb_space at the bottom of the steps leading from kb_waterloo_(abba_song) kb_place_of_articulation to st. james park '' . `` the formation in 1838 of claridge 's kb_patent asphalte company ( with kb_a distinguished kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of kb_aristocracy_(class) patrons , and kb_marc_isambard_brunel and kb_isambard_kingdom_brunel brunel as , respectively , kb_a trustee and consulting kb_civil_engineering ) , gave an enormous impetus to the development of kb_a kb_kingdom_of_great_britain kb_asphalt kb_industry '' . `` by the end of 1838 , at least kb_2_(number) kb_other_(philosophy) kb_list_of_companies_of_albania , robinson 's and the bastenne company , were in production '' , with kb_asphalt kb_being laid as paving at kb_brighton , herne bay , kb_diocese_of_canterbury , kensington , the strand , and kb_a kb_prespa_lake floor kb_area in bunhill-row , while meantime claridge 's whitehall paving `` continue ( d ) in good kb_order_(biology) '' .in 1838 , there was kb_a flurry of entrepreneurial activity involving kb_asphalt , which had uses beyond paving . for example , kb_asphalt could also kb_beryllium used for flooring , damp proofing in kb_buildings , and for kb_waterproofing of various types of pools and baths , both of which were also proliferating in the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century . on the kb_university_of_london stockmarket , there were various claims as to the exclusivity of kb_asphalt quality from kb_france , kb_germany and kb_kingdom_of_england . and numerous patents were granted in kb_france , with similar kb_grammatical_number of kb_patent applications kb_being denied in kb_kingdom_of_england due to their similarity to each kb_other_(philosophy) . in kb_kingdom_of_england , `` claridge 's was the kb_type_(biology) most used in the 1840s and 50s '' .in 1914 , claridge 's company entered into kb_a joint venture to produce kb_macadam#tar-bound_macadam kb_macadam , with materials manufactured through kb_a subsidiary company called clarmac roads ltd. kb_2_(number) products resulted , namely `` clarmac '' , and `` clarphalte '' , with the former kb_being manufactured by clarmac roads and the latter by claridge 's kb_patent asphalte co. , although `` clarmac '' was more widely used . however , the kb_first_world_war kb_war ruined the clarmac company , which entered into liquidation in 1915. the failure of clarmac roads ltd had kb_a flow-on effect to claridge 's company , which was itself compulsorily wound up , ceasing operations in 1917 , having invested kb_a substantial amount of funds into the kb_new_world venture , both at the outset and in kb_a subsequent attempt to save the clarmac company .kb_asphalt was thought in kb_rilindja_kombëtare century kb_great_britain to contain kb_chemical_substance with medicinal kb_chemical_property . extracts from kb_asphalt were used to treat kb_catarrh and some kb_theory_of_forms of kb_asthma and as kb_a remedy against worms , especially the kb_tapeworm .the kb_first_trimester use of kb_asphalt in the kb_new_world was by kb_indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas kb_people's_party_of_armenia . on the kb_western_culture kb_coast , as early as the 13th century , the kb_tongva_people , kb_luiseño_people and kb_chumash_people kb_people's_party_of_armenia collected the naturally occurring kb_asphalt that seeped to the kb_surface_(topology) above underlying kb_petroleum kb_deposit_(geology) . all kb_triliteral kb_group_(mathematics) used the kb_matter as an kb_adhesive . kb_it is found on many different kb_artifact_(archaeology) of tools and ceremonial items . for example , kb_it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or kb_turtle kb_electron_shells to kb_rattle_(percussion_instrument) handles . kb_it was also used in decorations . small round kb_electron_shell beads were often kb_set_(mythology) in asphaltum to provide decorations . kb_it was used as kb_a kb_sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying kb_water , possibly poisoning those kb_world_health_organization drank the kb_water . kb_asphalt was used also to kb_seal_(emblem) the planks on ocean-going canoes .kb_asphalt was kb_first_trimester used to pave streets in the 1870s . at kb_first_trimester naturally occurring `` bituminous kb_rock_of_gibraltar '' was used , such as at ritchie mines in macfarlan in ritchie county , kb_west_virginia from 1852 to 1873. in 1876 , asphalt-based paving was used to pave kb_pennsylvania avenue in kb_washington,_d.c. dc , in kb_time_(magazine) for the celebration of the national centennial . in the horse-drawn era , streets were unpaved and covered with dirt or kb_gravel . however , that produced uneven wear , opened kb_new_world hazards for pedestrians and made for dangerous potholes for bicycles and for motor vehicles . kb_manhattan alone had 130,000 horses in 1900 , pulling streetcars , wagons , and carriages , and leaving their waste behind . they were not fast , and pedestrians could dodge and scramble their way across the crowded streets . small towns continued to rely on dirt and kb_gravel , but larger cities wanted much better streets . they looked to kb_wood or granite kb_periodic_table_block by the kb_1850s_in_the_united_states . in 1890 , kb_a kb_ipad_(third_generation) of kb_chicago 's 2000 miles of streets were kb_road_surface , chiefly with wooden kb_periodic_table_block , which gave better traction than mud . kb_brick surfacing was kb_a good compromise , but even better was kb_asphalt paving , which was easy to install and to cut through to get at sewers . with kb_university_of_london and kb_paris serving as models , kb_washington,_d.c. laid 400,000 kb_square yards of kb_asphalt paving by 1882 ; kb_it became the kb_rutherford_model for buffalo , kb_philadelphia and elsewhere . by the end of the century , kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) cities boasted 30 million kb_square yards of kb_asphalt paving , kb_water_well ahead of kb_brick . the streets became faster and more dangerous kb_sulfate electric traffic lights were installed . electric trolleys ( at 12 miles per hour ) became the main kb_transportation service for middle kb_class_(biology) shoppers and kb_office workers until they bought kb_automobiles after kb_1945_(gingrich_novel) and commuted from more distant suburbs in privacy and comfort on kb_asphalt highways .kb_canada has the kb_world_war_ii 's kb_largest_organisms deposit of kb_natural_number kb_asphalt in the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands , and kb_canadians kb_first_nations along the kb_athabasca_river had kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) used kb_it to waterproof their canoes . in 1719 , kb_a kb_cree_language kb_english_alphabet#letter_names wa-pa-su brought kb_a kb_sample_(statistics) for kb_trade to kb_henry_kelsey kelsey of the kb_hudson_river 's bay company , kb_world_health_organization was the kb_first_trimester recorded kb_european_eel to kb_episcopal_see kb_it . however , kb_it was n't until 1787 that fur trader and kb_age_of_discovery kb_alexander_mackenzie_(explorer) saw the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands and said , `` at about 24 miles from the fork ( of the kb_athabasca_river and clearwater kb_list_of_rivers_of_alberta ) are some bituminous fountains into which kb_a pole of 20 kb_foot kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) may kb_beryllium inserted without the least kb_electrical_resistance . ''the kb_lightness of the deposit was obvious from the start , but the means of extracting the kb_asphalt was not . the nearest town , kb_fort_mcmurray , kb_alberta , was kb_a small fur kb_trading_post post , kb_other_(philosophy) kb_market_(economics) were far away , and kb_transportation costs were too kb_high_middle_ages to kb_spacecraft the raw bituminous kb_sand for paving . in 1915 , sidney ells of the kb_united_states_courts_of_appeals mines branch experimented with separation techniques and used the kb_decay_product to pave 600 kb_foot of road in kb_edmonton , kb_alberta . kb_other_(philosophy) roads in kb_alberta were kb_road_surface with kb_material extracted from kb_oil_sands , but kb_it was generally not kb_economic_anthropology . during the 1920s kb_karl_clark_(chemist) karl a. kb_william_clark of the kb_alberta_research_council council kb_patented kb_a hot kb_water kb_palm_oil separation process and entrepreneur robert kb_circa fitzsimmons built the kb_bitumount kb_palm_oil separation kb_plant , which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to per day of kb_asphalt using dr. kb_william_clark 's method . most of the kb_asphalt was used for kb_waterproofing roofs , but kb_semi-syllabary included fuels , lubrication kb_cooking_oil , kb_computer_printer ink , medicines , rust- and acid-proof paints , fireproof roofing , street paving , kb_patent_leather , and fence post preservatives . eventually fitzsimmons kb_ran_(film) out of kb_money and the kb_plant was taken over by the kb_alberta kb_government_of_angola . today the kb_bitumount kb_plant is kb_a kb_provincial_historic_sites_of_alberta kb_historic_site site .kb_asphalt was used in early photographic kb_technology . in 1826 or 1827 , kb_it was used by kb_france kb_scientist kb_joseph_nicéphore_niépce nicéphore niépce to make the kb_view_from_the_window_at_le_gras surviving photograph from kb_nature . the kb_asphalt was thinly coated onto kb_a kb_pewter plate which was then exposed in kb_a kb_camera . exposure to kb_light hardened the kb_asphalt and made kb_it kb_insoluble , kb_sulfate that when kb_it was subsequently rinsed with kb_a kb_solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained . many hours of exposure in the kb_camera were required , making kb_asphalt impractical for kb_ordinary_(officer) photography , but from the kb_1850s_in_the_united_states to the 1920s kb_it was in common use as kb_a kb_photoresist in the production of printing kb_photographic_plate for various photomechanical printing processes .kb_asphalt was the kb_nemesis_(nobel_play) of many artists during the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century . although widely used for kb_a kb_time_(magazine) , kb_it ultimately proved unstable for use in kb_palm_oil kb_painting , especially when mixed with the most common diluents , such as linseed kb_palm_oil , kb_varnish and kb_turpentine . unless thoroughly diluted , kb_asphalt never fully solidifies and kb_will_and_testament in kb_time_(magazine) corrupt the kb_other_(philosophy) pigments with which kb_it comes into contact . the use of kb_asphalt as kb_a glaze to kb_set_(mythology) in shadow or mixed with kb_other_(philosophy) colors to render kb_a darker kb_tone_(linguistics) resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings , for instance those of kb_eugène_delacroix . perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of kb_asphalt is kb_théodore_géricault géricault 's kb_the_raft_of_the_medusa of the kb_medusa ( 1818–1819 ) , where kb_histidine use of kb_asphalt caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the kb_paint and kb_canvas to buckle .the vast majority of refined kb_asphalt is used in kb_construction : primarily as kb_a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications . according to the kb_requirement_analysis of the end use , kb_asphalt is produced to specification . this is achieved either by refining or blending . kb_it is estimated that the kb_electric_current kb_world_war_ii use of kb_asphalt is approximately 102 million kb_tonnes per year . approximately 85 % of all the kb_asphalt produced is used as the kb_binder_(material) in kb_asphalt_concrete for roads . kb_it is also used in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_road_surface areas such as kb_airport runways , kb_car parks and footways . typically , the production of kb_asphalt_concrete involves mixing kb_fine_(penalty) and coarse kb_construction_aggregate such as kb_sand , kb_gravel and crushed kb_rock_of_gibraltar with kb_asphalt , which acts as the binding agent . kb_other_(philosophy) materials , such as kb_recycling polymers ( e.g. , kb_rubber kb_tire ) , may kb_beryllium added to the kb_asphalt to modify its kb_chemical_property according to the kb_application_(computing) for which the kb_asphalt is ultimately kb_intention .kb_a further 10 % of kb_globalization kb_asphalt production is used in roofing applications , where its kb_waterproofing qualities are invaluable .the remaining 5 % of kb_asphalt is used mainly for sealing and insulating purposes in kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of building materials , such as pipe coatings , carpet tile backing and kb_paint . kb_asphalt is kb_applied_science in the kb_construction and maintenance of many kb_structural_analysis , kb_systems_analysis , and components , such as the following :the kb_largest_organisms use of kb_asphalt is for making kb_asphalt_concrete for road surfaces ; this accounts for approximately 85 % of the kb_asphalt consumed in the united kb_sovereign_state . there are about 4,000 kb_asphalt_concrete mixing plants in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , and kb_a similar kb_grammatical_number in kb_europe .kb_asphalt_concrete kb_road_surface mixes are typically composed of 5 % kb_asphalt kb_cement and 95 % kb_construction_aggregate ( stone , kb_sand , and kb_gravel ) . due to its highly kb_viscosity kb_nature , kb_asphalt kb_cement must kb_beryllium heated kb_sulfate kb_it can kb_beryllium mixed with the kb_construction_aggregate at the kb_asphalt mixing facility . the kb_temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the kb_asphalt and the kb_construction_aggregate , but kb_asphalt_concrete#mixture_formulations kb_asphalt technologies allow producers to reduce the kb_temperature required .the weight of an kb_asphalt kb_road_surface depends upon the kb_construction_aggregate kb_type_(biology) , the kb_asphalt , and the kb_air_(classical_element) void content . an average example in the united kb_sovereign_state is about 112 pounds per kb_square_yard , per kb_inch of kb_road_surface thickness .when maintenance is performed on kb_asphalt pavements , such as kb_pavement_milling to remove kb_a worn or damaged kb_surface_(topology) , the removed kb_material can kb_beryllium returned to kb_a facility for kb_fish_processing into kb_new_world kb_road_surface mixtures . the kb_asphalt in the removed kb_material can kb_beryllium reactivated and put back to use in kb_new_world kb_road_surface mixes . with some 95 % of kb_road_surface roads kb_being constructed of or surfaced with kb_asphalt , kb_a substantial amount of kb_asphalt kb_road_surface kb_material is reclaimed each year . according to kb_industry surveys conducted annually by the kb_federal_highway_administration kb_administration_(government) and the national kb_asphalt kb_road_surface kb_continental_association , more than 99 % of the kb_asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of kb_new_world pavements , roadbeds , shoulders and embankments .kb_asphalt_concrete paving is widely used in airports around the kb_world_war_ii . due to the sturdiness and ability to kb_beryllium repaired quickly , kb_it is widely used for runways .kb_mastic_asphalt is kb_a kb_type_(biology) of kb_asphalt that differs from dense graded kb_asphalt ( kb_asphalt_concrete ) in that kb_it has kb_a higher kb_asphalt ( kb_binder_(material) ) content , usually around 7–10 % of the whole kb_construction_aggregate mix , as opposed to rolled kb_asphalt_concrete , which has only around 5 % kb_asphalt . this kb_thermoplastic kb_matter is widely used in the building kb_industry for kb_waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground . kb_mastic_asphalt is heated to kb_a kb_temperature of and is kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) in layers to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism an impervious kb_potential_barrier about thick .kb_a kb_grammatical_number of technologies allow kb_asphalt to kb_beryllium mixed at much lower temperatures . these involve mixing with kb_petroleum solvents to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` cutbacks '' with kb_redox kb_melting_point or mixing with kb_water to kb_turn_(geometry) the kb_asphalt into an kb_emulsion . kb_asphalt emulsions contain up to 70 % kb_asphalt and typically less than 1.5 % kb_protein_sequencing additives . there are kb_2_(number) main types of emulsions with different affinity for kb_construction_aggregate , kb_cationic and kb_anionic . kb_asphalt emulsions are used in kb_a wide kb_variety_(magazine) of applications . kb_chipseal involves spraying the road kb_surface_(topology) with kb_asphalt kb_emulsion followed by kb_a layer of crushed kb_rock_of_gibraltar , kb_gravel or crushed kb_slag . kb_slurry kb_seal_(emblem) involves the creation of kb_a kb_mixture of kb_asphalt kb_emulsion and kb_fine_(penalty) crushed kb_construction_aggregate that is kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) on the kb_surface_(topology) of kb_a road . cold-mixed kb_asphalt can also kb_beryllium made from kb_asphalt kb_emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed kb_asphalt , several inches in depth , and kb_asphalt emulsions are also blended into kb_recycling hot-mix kb_asphalt to create low-cost pavements .kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , also known as syncrude , is the output from kb_a kb_upgrader facility used in connection with kb_palm_oil kb_sand production in kb_canada . bituminous sands are mined using enormous ( 100 ton capacity ) kb_power_(physics) shovels and loaded into even larger ( 400 ton capacity ) kb_dump_trucks trucks for kb_movement_(sign_language) to an upgrading facility . the process used to extract the kb_asphalt from the kb_sand is kb_a hot kb_water process originally kb_adaptation by kb_karl_clark_(chemist) karl kb_william_clark of the kb_university_of_alberta kb_alberta during the 1920s . after extraction from the kb_sand , the kb_asphalt is fed into kb_a kb_upgrader which converts kb_it into kb_a kb_light_crude_oil kb_palm_oil kb_cognate . this synthetic kb_matter is kb_fluid enough to kb_beryllium transferred through kb_petroleum kb_palm_oil pipelines and can kb_beryllium fed into kb_petroleum kb_oil_refinery without any further treatment . by 2015 kb_canadians kb_asphalt upgraders were producing over per day of kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , of which 75 % was exported to kb_oil_refinery in the united kb_sovereign_state .in kb_alberta , five kb_asphalt upgraders produce kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil and kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of kb_other_(philosophy) products : the kb_suncor_energy kb_energy_industry upgrader near kb_fort_mcmurray , kb_alberta produces kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil plus kb_diesel_engine kb_fuel ; the kb_syncrude_canada kb_canada , kb_canadian_natural_resources resources , and kb_nexen upgraders near kb_fort_mcmurray produce kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil ; and the kb_electron_shell kb_scotford_upgrader upgrader near kb_edmonton produces kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil plus an intermediate kb_feedstock for the nearby kb_electron_shell kb_oil_refinery . kb_a sixth upgrader , under kb_construction in 2015 near redwater , kb_alberta , kb_will_and_testament upgrade half of its crude kb_asphalt directly to kb_diesel_engine kb_fuel , with the remainder of the output kb_being sold as kb_feedstock to nearby kb_oil_refinery and kb_petrochemical plants .kb_canadians kb_asphalt does not differ substantially from kb_cooking_oil such as kb_venezuelans extra-heavy and kb_mexican_people kb_heavy_crude_oil kb_palm_oil in kb_protein_sequencing kb_function_composition , and the real difficulty is moving the extremely kb_viscosity kb_asphalt through kb_palm_oil pipelines to the refinery . many kb_modern_history kb_oil_refinery are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded kb_asphalt directly into products such as kb_gasoline , kb_diesel_engine kb_fuel , and refined kb_asphalt without any preprocessing . this is particularly common in areas such as the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) kb_gulf_of_mexico kb_coast , where kb_refineries were kb_aircraft_design_process to process kb_venezuelans and kb_mexican_people kb_palm_oil , and in areas such as the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) kb_midwestern_united_states where kb_refineries were rebuilt to process kb_heavy_crude_oil kb_palm_oil as domestic kb_light kb_extraction_of_petroleum declined . given the kb_utility , such kb_heavy_crude_oil kb_oil_refinery usually prefer to buy kb_asphalt rather than synthetic kb_palm_oil because the cost is lower , and in some kb_noun_case because they prefer to produce more kb_diesel_engine kb_fuel and less kb_gasoline . by 2015 kb_canadians production and exports of non-upgraded kb_asphalt exceeded that of kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil at over per day , of which about 65 % was exported to the united kb_sovereign_state .because of the difficulty of moving crude kb_asphalt through pipelines , non-upgraded kb_asphalt is usually diluted with kb_natural-gas_condensate condensate in kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism called kb_dilbit or with kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , called kb_synbit . however , to meet international competition , much non-upgraded kb_asphalt is now sold as kb_a blend of kb_cross-platform_software kb_grade_(education) of kb_asphalt , kb_petroleum kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , and condensate in kb_a standardized benchmark kb_decay_product such as kb_western_canadian_select select . this sour , heavy kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil blend is kb_aircraft_design_process to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy kb_cooking_oil such as kb_petroleum_industry_in_mexico or kb_arabian_plate kb_dubai_crude crude .kb_asphalt was used starting in the kb_1960s_in_the_united_states as kb_a kb_hydrophobe kb_matrix_(math) aiming to encapsulate kb_radioactive_decay waste such as medium-activity kb_salt_(chemistry) ( mainly kb_solubility kb_sodium_nitrate and kb_sodium_sulfate ) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or kb_radioactive_decay sludges from kb_sediment_transport#fluvial ponds . bituminised kb_radioactive_decay waste containing highly kb_radiotoxic kb_ionizing_radiation#alpha_particles kb_transuranium_element from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in kb_france , kb_belgium and kb_japan , but this kb_type_(biology) of waste kb_physical_exercise has been abandoned because operational kb_air_safety issues ( risks of kb_fire_(classical_element) , as occurred in kb_a bituminisation kb_plant at tokai works in kb_japan ) and long-term stability kb_problems_(aristotle) related to their kb_deep_geological_repository in deep kb_rock_of_gibraltar kb_geological_formation . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the main problem is the swelling of kb_asphalt exposed to kb_radiation and to kb_water . kb_asphalt swelling is kb_first_trimester induced by kb_radiation because of the presence of kb_hydrogen kb_gas bubbles generated by kb_alpha_(letter) and gamma kb_radiolysis . kb_a kb_second_language kb_mechanism_(biology) is kb_the_matrix kb_matrix_(math) swelling when the encapsulated kb_hygroscopic kb_salt_(chemistry) exposed to kb_water or moisture start to rehydrate and to kb_dissolve_(filmmaking) . the kb_high_middle_ages kb_concentration of kb_salt_(chemistry) in the pore kb_solid_solution inside the bituminised kb_matrix_(math) is then responsible for kb_osmosis effects inside the bituminised kb_matrix_(math) . the kb_water moves in the direction of the concentrated kb_salt_(chemistry) , the kb_asphalt acting as kb_a kb_semipermeable_membrane kb_cell_membrane . this also kb_causes_of_autism kb_the_matrix kb_matrix_(math) to swell . the swelling kb_pressure due to kb_osmosis effect under constant kb_volume can kb_beryllium as kb_high_middle_ages as 200 bar . if not properly managed , this kb_high_middle_ages kb_pressure can cause fractures in the near field of kb_a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste . when the bituminised kb_matrix_(math) has been altered by swelling , encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of kb_ground_water kb_water and released in the geosphere . the kb_high_middle_ages kb_ionic_strength of the concentrated kb_saline_(medicine) kb_solid_solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in kb_clay host kb_rock_(geology) . the presence of chemically kb_reactivity_(chemistry) kb_nitrate can also kb_affect_(psychology) the kb_redox conditions prevailing in the host kb_rock_of_gibraltar by establishing kb_redox conditions , preventing the kb_redox of redox-sensitive radionuclides . under their higher valences , radionuclides of kb_chemical_element such as kb_selenium , technetium , kb_uranium , kb_neptunium and kb_plutonium have kb_a higher kb_solubility and are also often present in kb_water as non-retarded anions . this makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging .different kb_type_(biology) of kb_asphalt have been used : blown kb_asphalt ( partly kb_oxidation with kb_air_(classical_element) kb_oxygen at kb_high_middle_ages kb_temperature after kb_distillation , and harder ) and direct kb_distillation kb_asphalt ( softer ) . blown bitumens like mexphalte , with kb_a kb_high_middle_ages content of kb_saturation_(chemistry) kb_hydrocarbons , are more easily biodegraded by microorganisms than direct kb_distillation kb_asphalt , with kb_a low content of kb_saturation_(chemistry) kb_hydrocarbons and kb_a kb_high_middle_ages content of kb_aromatic kb_hydrocarbons .kb_concrete encapsulation of radwaste is presently considered kb_a safer alternative by the kb_nuclear_industry kb_industry and the kb_waste_management kb_management organisations .roofing shingles account for most of the remaining kb_asphalt consumption . kb_semi-syllabary include kb_cattle sprays , fence-post treatments , and kb_waterproofing for fabrics . kb_asphalt is used to make kb_japan_black , kb_a kb_lacquerabout 40,000,000 tons were produced in 1984. kb_it is obtained as the `` heavy '' ( i.e. , difficult to distill ) kb_fraction_(mathematics) . kb_material with kb_a kb_boiling_point point greater than around 500 °c is considered kb_asphalt . kb_vacuum_distillation separates kb_it from the kb_other_(philosophy) components in kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil ( such as kb_naphtha , kb_gasoline and kb_diesel_engine ) . the resulting kb_material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the kb_chemical_property of the kb_material to suit applications . in kb_a kb_de-asphalting_unit kb_units_of_measurement , the crude kb_asphalt is treated with either kb_propane or kb_butane in kb_a kb_supercritical_fluid kb_phase_(matter) to extract the lighter molecules , which are then separated . further kb_fish_processing is possible by `` blowing '' the kb_decay_product : namely reacting kb_it with kb_oxygen . this step makes the kb_decay_product harder and more kb_viscosity .kb_asphalt is typically stored and transported at temperatures around . sometimes kb_diesel_oil or kb_kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity ; upon kb_childbirth , these lighter materials are separated out of the kb_mixture . this kb_mixture is often called `` kb_asphalt kb_feedstock '' , or bfs . some kb_dump_trucks trucks route the hot kb_engine exhaust through pipes in the dump kb_human_body to keep the kb_material warm . the backs of tippers carrying kb_asphalt , as kb_water_well as some kb_car_handling equipment , are also commonly sprayed with kb_a releasing agent before filling to kb_aid release . kb_diesel_oil is no longer used as kb_a kb_release_agent agent due to environmental concerns .naturally occurring crude kb_asphalt impregnated in kb_sedimentary_rock is the kb_prime_(symbol) kb_animal_feed stock for kb_petroleum production from `` kb_oil_sands '' , currently under development in kb_alberta , kb_canada . kb_canada has most of the kb_world_war_ii 's supply of kb_natural_number kb_asphalt , covering 140,000 kb_square kilometres ( an kb_area larger than kb_kingdom_of_england ) , giving kb_it the second-largest proven kb_patos-marinza_oil_field in the kb_world_war_ii . the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands are the kb_largest_organisms kb_asphalt deposit in kb_canada and the only kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) accessible to kb_surface_mining , although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper kb_deposit_(geology) becoming producible by `` kb_in_situ situ '' methods . because of kb_world_oil_market_chronology_from_2003 increases after 2003 , producing kb_asphalt became highly profitable , but as kb_a result of the decline after 2014 kb_it became uneconomic to build kb_new_world plants again . by 2014 , kb_canadians crude kb_asphalt production averaged about per day and was projected to rise to per day by 2020. the total amount of crude kb_asphalt in kb_alberta that could kb_beryllium extracted is estimated to kb_beryllium about , which at kb_a rate of would last about 200 years .although uncompetitive economically , kb_asphalt can kb_beryllium made from nonpetroleum-based renewable resources such as kb_sugar , kb_molasses and kb_rice , kb_corn and kb_potato starches . kb_asphalt can also kb_beryllium made from waste kb_material by kb_fractional_distillation kb_distillation of used kb_motor_oil kb_palm_oil , which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills . use of kb_motor_oil kb_palm_oil may cause premature kb_cracking_(chemistry) in colder climates , resulting in roads that need to kb_beryllium repaved more

occurring kb_solid kb_hydrocarbon kb_asphalt found in native kb_deposit_(geology) in kb_selenice , in kb_albania , the only kb_european_eel kb_asphalt mine still in use . the kb_asphalt is found in the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of veins , filling cracks in kb_a more or less horizontal direction . the kb_asphalt content varies from kb_bismuth % to 92 % ( kb_solubility in kb_carbon disulphide ) , with kb_a penetration kb_lightness near to kb_0_(number) and kb_a softening point ( kb_ring_(mathematics) and ball ) around 120 °c . the kb_insoluble kb_matter , consisting mainly of kb_silica kb_ore , ranges from kb_group_8_element % to 17 % .kb_albanians kb_asphalt extraction has kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_history and was practiced in an organized way by kb_ancient_rome kb_roman_empire . after kb_century_(cricket) of silence , the kb_first_trimester mentions of kb_albanians kb_asphalt appeared only in 1868 , when the frenchman kb_henri_coquand published the kb_first_trimester kb_geological description of the kb_deposit_(geology) of kb_albanians kb_asphalt . in 1875 , the kb_exploitation_film kb_catalan_constitutions were granted to the kb_ottoman_empire kb_government_of_angola and in 1912 , they were transferred to the kb_italian_language company simsa . since kb_1945_(gingrich_novel) , the mine was exploited by the kb_albanians kb_government_of_angola and from 2001 to date , the kb_management passed to kb_a kb_france company , which organized the kb_mining_industry process for the manufacture of the kb_natural_number kb_asphalt on an industrial scale .today the mine is predominantly exploited in an kb_open_standard pit quarry but several of the many underground mines ( deep and extending over several km ) still remain viable . selenizza is produced primarily in granular kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , after kb_melting_point the kb_asphalt pieces selected in the mine .selenizza is mainly used as an additive in the kb_road_surface kb_construction sector . kb_it is mixed with traditional kb_asphalt to improve both the viscoelastic kb_chemical_property and the kb_electrical_resistance to ageing . kb_it may kb_beryllium blended with the hot kb_asphalt in kb_german_tanks_in_world_war_ii , but its granular kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism allows kb_it to kb_beryllium fed in the mixer or in the kb_recycling kb_ring_(mathematics) of normal kb_asphalt plants . kb_other_(philosophy) typical applications include the production of kb_mastic_(plant_resin) asphalts for sidewalks , kb_romanesque_architecture , car-parks and kb_urban_area roads as kb_water_well as drilling kb_fluid additives for the kb_crude_oil kb_gas kb_industry . selenizza is kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance in

kb_science of the kb_natural_number selenizza compared with kb_petroleum kb_asphalt has shown that the environmental impact of the selenizza is about half the impact of the road kb_asphalt produced in kb_oil_refinery in terms of kb_carbon_dioxide kb_emission_spectra .although kb_asphalt typically makes up only 4 to 5 percent ( by weight ) of the kb_road_surface kb_mixture , as the kb_road_surface 's kb_binder_(material) , kb_it is also the most expensive part of the cost of the road-paving kb_material .during kb_asphalt 's early use in kb_modern_history paving , kb_palm_oil refiners gave kb_it away . however , kb_asphalt is , today , kb_a highly traded commodity . its prices increased substantially in the early 21st century . kb_a kb_federal_government_of_the_united_states report kb_sovereign_state :the report indicates that an `` average '' 1-mile ( 1.6-kilometer ) -long , four-lane highway would include `` 300 tons of kb_asphalt , '' which , `` in kb_2002_australian_open

kb_teleprinter kb_code promoted by kb_bell kb_big_data kb_service_(economics) . kb_cold_working on the kb_ascii standard began on kb_october 6 , kb_u.s._presidential_election,_1960 , with the kb_first_trimester meeting of the kb_american_standards_association kb_continental_association 's ( asa ) ( now the kb_american_national_standards_institute kb_corporate_social_responsibility institute or kb_american_national_standards_institute ) x3.2 subcommittee . the kb_first_trimester edition of the standard was published in 1963 , underwent kb_a kb_major_(united_states) revision during 1967 , and experienced its most recent update during 1986. compared to kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet kb_telegraph kb_code_(cryptography) , the kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_bell kb_code and kb_ascii were both kb_totally_ordered_set for more convenient kb_sorting_algorithm ( i.e. , alphabetization ) of lists , and added features for devices kb_other_(philosophy) than teleprinters .originally based on the kb_english_alphabet , kb_ascii encodes 128 specified kb_character_(computing) into seven-bit integers as shown by the kb_ascii chart above . ninety-five of the encoded kb_character_(computing) are printable : these include the digits `` 0 '' to `` 9 '' , kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_a '' to `` kb_carboxybenzyl '' , kb_upper_case kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_a '' to `` kb_carboxybenzyl '' , and punctuation kb_symbols . in kb_addition , the original kb_ascii specification included 33 non-printing control kb_code_(cryptography) which originated with

subcommittee 's x3.2.4 kb_working_group kb_group_(periodic_table) ( now kb_incits ) . the asa became the kb_united_states_of_america_standards_institute of kb_americas kb_corporate_social_responsibility institute ( usasi ) and ultimately the kb_american_national_standards_institute kb_corporate_social_responsibility institute ( kb_american_national_standards_institute ) .with the kb_other_(philosophy) special kb_character_(computing) and control kb_code_(cryptography) filled in , kb_ascii was published as asa x3.4-1963 , leaving 28 kb_code positions without any assigned kb_meaning_(linguistics) , reserved for future standardization , and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) unassigned kb_control_code kb_code . there was some kb_abortion_debate at the kb_time_(magazine) whether there should kb_beryllium more control kb_character_(computing) rather than the kb_lower_case kb_alphabet . the indecision did not last kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) : during may 1963 the ccitt working party on the kb_new_world kb_telegraph kb_alphabet kb_anatolian_hypothesis to assign kb_lower_case kb_character_(computing) to `` sticks '' 6 and 7 , and kb_international_organization_for_standardization organization for standardization tc 97 sc kb_alkaline_earth_metal voted during kb_october to incorporate the change into

and 7 caused the kb_character_(computing) to differ in kb_bit_(horse) kb_pattern from the kb_upper_egypt case by kb_a kb_single_bond kb_bit_(horse) , which simplified kb_case-insensitive kb_character_(computing) matching and the kb_construction of keyboards and kb_computer_printer .the x3 committee made kb_other_(philosophy) changes , including kb_other_(philosophy) kb_new_world kb_character_(computing) ( the kb_brace_(punctuation) and kb_vertical_bar bar kb_character_(computing) ) , renaming some control kb_character_(computing) ( som became start of header ( soh ) ) and

kb_american_national_standards_institute x3.4-1986 .revisions of the kb_ascii standard :in the x3.15 standard , the x3 committee also addressed how kb_ascii should kb_beryllium transmitted (

kb_teleprinter encoding kb_systems_analysis . like kb_other_(philosophy) kb_character_(computing) encodings , kb_ascii specifies kb_a correspondence between kb_digital_data kb_bit_(horse) patterns and kb_character_(computing) kb_symbols ( i.e . kb_graphemes and control kb_character_(computing) ) . this allows kb_digital_data devices to communicate with each kb_other_(philosophy) and to process , store , and communicate character-oriented kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) such as written kb_hunnic_language . before kb_ascii was kb_adaptation , the encodings in use included 26 kb_english_alphabet kb_character_(computing) , 10 numerical digits , and from 11 to 25 special graphic kb_symbols . to include all these , and control kb_character_(computing) compatible with the

1870 and kb_patented in 1874 .the committee debated the possibility of kb_a kb_shift_code kb_function_(biology) ( like in kb_ita2 ) , which would allow more than 64 kb_code_(cryptography) to kb_beryllium represented by kb_a kb_six-bit_character_code kb_code . in kb_a shifted kb_code , some kb_character_(computing) kb_code_(cryptography) determine choices between options for the following kb_character_(computing) kb_code_(cryptography) . kb_it allows compact encoding , but is less reliable for kb_data_transmission , as an kb_error in transmitting the kb_shift_code kb_code typically makes kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) part of the kb_transmission_coefficient unreadable . the kb_corporate_social_responsibility committee decided against shifting , and kb_sulfate kb_ascii required at least kb_a seven-bit kb_code .the committee considered an kb_eight-bit kb_code , since eight bits ( octets ) would allow kb_2_(number) four-bit patterns to efficiently encode kb_2_(number) digits with kb_binary-coded_decimal kb_decimal . however , kb_it would require all kb_data_transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice . the committee voted to use kb_a seven-bit kb_code to minimize costs associated with kb_data_transmission . since perforated tape at the kb_time_(magazine) could record eight bits in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_positional_notation , kb_it also allowed for kb_a kb_parity_bit kb_bit_(horse) for kb_error_checking if desired . kb_eight-bit machines ( with octets as the native kb_big_data kb_type_(biology) ) that did not use parity checking typically kb_set_(mythology) the eighth kb_bit_(horse) to 0. in some kb_computer_printer , the kb_high_middle_ages kb_bit_(horse) was used to enable kb_italics printing .the kb_code itself was

kb_sulfate called `` kb_ascii sticks '' ( 32 positions ) were reserved for control kb_character_(computing) . the `` kb_space '' kb_character_(computing) had to come before graphics to make kb_sorting_algorithm easier , kb_sulfate kb_it became kb_positional_notation 20 ; for the same kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits . the committee decided kb_it was important to support kb_upper_case kb_sixbit_code_pages alphabets , and chose to kb_pattern kb_ascii kb_sulfate kb_it could kb_beryllium kb_redox easily to kb_a usable 64-character kb_set_(mythology) of graphic kb_code_(cryptography) , as was done in the kb_dec_sixbit kb_code ( 1963 ) . kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) were therefore not interleaved with kb_upper_case . to keep options kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance for kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) and kb_other_(philosophy) graphics , the special and numeric kb_code_(cryptography) were arranged before the kb_letter_(alphabet) , and the kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_a '' was placed in kb_positional_notation 41 to match the draft of the corresponding kb_kingdom_of_great_britain standard . the digits 0–9 are prefixed with 011 , but the remaining kb_nibble bits correspond to their respective values in kb_binary_number , making kb_conversion_to_christianity with kb_binary-coded_decimal kb_decimal straightforward .many of the non-alphanumeric kb_character_(computing) were positioned to correspond to their shifted kb_positional_notation on typewriters ; an important subtlety is that these were based on `` kb_mechanics '' typewriters , not `` electric '' typewriters . kb_mechanics typewriters followed the standard kb_set_(mythology) by the remington no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal ( 1878 ) , the kb_first_trimester kb_typewriter with kb_a kb_shift_code kb_key_(cryptography) , and the shifted values of codice_1 were codice_2 early typewriters omitted `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' , using `` kb_oxygen '' ( kb_capital_letter `` kb_oxygen '' ) and `` l '' ( kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) `` l '' ) instead , but codice_3 and codice_4 pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common . thus , in kb_ascii codice_5 were placed in the kb_second_language stick , positions 1–5 , corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent stick . the parentheses could not correspond to `` 9 '' and `` 0 '' , however , because the kb_place_of_articulation corresponding to `` 0 '' was taken by the kb_space kb_character_(computing) . this was accommodated by removing codice_6 ( kb_underscore ) from `` 6 '' and shifting the remaining kb_character_(computing) , which corresponded to many kb_european_eel typewriters that placed the parentheses with `` kb_group_8_element '' and `` 9 '' . this discrepancy from typewriters kb_light-emitting_diode to bit-paired keyboards , notably the kb_teletype_model_33 kb_rutherford_model 33 , which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to kb_ascii , not to traditional kb_mechanics typewriters . electric typewriters , notably the kb_ibm_selectric ( 1961 ) , used kb_a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers following the kb_ibm_pc ( 1981 ) , especially kb_model_m ( kb_1984_world_rally_championship_season ) and thus kb_shift_code values for kb_symbols on kb_modern_history keyboards do not correspond as closely to the kb_ascii table as kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet keyboards did . the codice_7 pair also dates to the no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal , and the codice_8 pairs were used on some keyboards ( others , including the no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal , did not kb_shift_code codice_9 ( comma ) or codice_10 ( kb_full_stop stop ) kb_sulfate they could kb_beryllium used in kb_upper_case without unshifting ) . however , kb_ascii split the codice_11 pair ( dating to no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal ) , and rearranged mathematical kb_symbols ( varied conventions , commonly codice_12 ) to codice_13 .some common kb_character_(computing) were not included , notably codice_14 , while codice_15 were included as kb_diacritics for international use , and codice_16 for mathematical use , together with the kb_simple_polygon kb_line_(geometry) kb_character_(computing) codice_17 ( in kb_addition to common codice_18 ) . the `` @ '' kb_symbol was not used in kb_continental_europe and the committee expected kb_it would kb_beryllium replaced by an accented `` à '' in the kb_france variation , kb_sulfate the `` @ '' was placed in kb_positional_notation 40 , kb_right-wing_politics before the kb_letter_(alphabet) kb_a .the control kb_code_(cryptography) felt kb_essential_element for kb_data_transmission were the start of message ( som ) , end of address ( eoa ) , kb_end_of_message of message ( eom ) , end of kb_transmission_coefficient ( eot ) , `` kb_world_health_organization are you ? '' ( wru ) , `` are you ? '' ( ru ) , kb_a reserved kb_analyzer control ( dc0 ) , synchronous idle ( sync ) , and acknowledge ( ack ) . these were positioned to maximize the kb_hamming_distance kb_distance between their kb_bit_(horse) patterns .ascii-code kb_order_(biology) is also called `` asciibetical '' kb_order_(biology) . kb_collation of kb_big_data is sometimes done in this kb_order_(biology) rather than `` standard '' kb_alphabetical_order kb_order_(biology) ( kb_collating_sequence sequence ) . the main deviations in kb_ascii kb_order_(biology) are :an intermediate kb_order_(biology) converts kb_upper_case kb_letter_(alphabet) to kb_lower_case before comparing kb_ascii values .kb_ascii reserves the kb_first_trimester 32 kb_code_(cryptography) ( kb_grammatical_number 0–31 kb_decimal ) for control kb_character_(computing) : kb_code_(cryptography) originally kb_intention not to represent printable kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) , but rather to control devices ( such as kb_computer_printer ) that make use of kb_ascii , or to provide kb_metadata about kb_big_data streams such as those stored on kb_magnetic tape .for example , kb_character_(computing) 10 represents the `` kb_line_feed '' kb_function_(biology) ( which kb_causes_of_autism kb_a printer to advance its paper ) , and kb_character_(computing) kb_group_8_element represents `` backspace '' . refers to control kb_character_(computing) that do not include kb_carriage_return return , kb_line_feed or kb_whitespace_(computer_science) as non-whitespace control kb_character_(computing) . except for the control kb_character_(computing) that kb_linguistic_prescription kb_elementary_school line-oriented formatting , kb_ascii does not define any kb_mechanism_(biology) for describing the kb_structure or kb_appearance_(philosophy) of text within kb_a document . kb_other_(philosophy) schemes , such as markup languages , address page and document layout and formatting .the original kb_ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) . the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional , for example where kb_a kb_character_(computing) would kb_beryllium used slightly differently on kb_a kb_computer_terminal link than on kb_a kb_data_stream , and sometimes accidental , for example with the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of `` kb_delete_key '' .probably the most influential kb_single_bond kb_analyzer on the kb_interpretation_(logic) of these kb_character_(computing) was the kb_teletype_model_33 kb_rutherford_model 33 asr , which was kb_a printing kb_computer_terminal with an kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance kb_punched_tape tape reader/punch option . kb_punched_tape tape was kb_a very popular kb_list_of_art_mediums for long-term kb_program_(computing) storage until the 1980s , less costly and in some ways less fragile than kb_magnetic tape . in kb_particular , the kb_teletype_model_33 kb_rutherford_model 33 kb_machine assignments for kb_code_(cryptography) 17 ( control-q , dc1 , also known as xon ) , 19 ( control-s , dc3 , also known as xoff ) , and 127 ( kb_delete_key ) became kb_de_facto kb_corporate_social_responsibility . the kb_rutherford_model 33 was also notable for taking the description of control-g ( kb_code 7 , bel , kb_meaning_(linguistics) audibly alert the operator ) literally , as the kb_units_of_measurement contained an actual kb_bell which kb_it rang when kb_it received kb_a bel kb_character_(computing) . because the keytop for the kb_oxygen kb_key_(cryptography) also showed kb_a left-arrow kb_symbol ( from ascii-1963 , which had this kb_character_(computing) instead of kb_underscore ) , kb_a noncompliant use of kb_code 15 ( control-o , kb_shift_code in ) interpreted as `` kb_delete_key previous kb_character_(computing) '' was also kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by many early timesharing kb_systems_analysis but eventually became neglected .when kb_a teletype 33 asr equipped with the automatic kb_punched_tape tape kb_reader_(academic_rank) received kb_a control-s ( xoff , an abbreviation for transmit off ) , kb_it caused the tape kb_reader_(academic_rank) to stop ; receiving control-q ( xon , `` transmit on '' ) caused the tape kb_reader_(academic_rank) to resume . this technique became kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by several early kb_apollo_guidance_computer operating kb_systems_analysis as kb_a `` handshaking '' signal warning kb_a sender to stop kb_transmission_coefficient because of impending kb_arithmetic_overflow ; kb_it persists to this day in many kb_systems_analysis as kb_a kb_manual_(music) output control technique . on some kb_systems_analysis control-s retains its kb_meaning_(linguistics) but control-q is replaced by kb_a kb_second_language control-s to resume output . the 33 asr also could kb_beryllium configured to employ control-r ( dc2 ) and control-t ( dc4 ) to start and stop the tape kb_punch_(magazine) ; on some units equipped with this kb_function_(biology) , the corresponding kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) lettering on the keycap above the kb_letter_(alphabet) was tape and tape respectively .the teletype could not move the kb_human_head backwards , kb_sulfate kb_it did not put kb_a kb_key_(cryptography) on the keyboard to send kb_a bs ( backspace ) . instead there was kb_a kb_key_(cryptography) marked `` rubout '' that sent kb_code 127 ( del ) . the purpose of this kb_key_(cryptography) was to erase mistakes in kb_a hand-typed kb_punched_tape tape : the operator had to push kb_a kb_button_(control) on the tape kb_punch_(magazine) to back kb_it up , then kb_type_(biology) the rubout , which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with kb_a kb_character_(computing) that was kb_intention to kb_beryllium ignored . teletypes were commonly used for the less-expensive computers from kb_digital_equipment_corporation corporation , kb_sulfate these kb_systems_analysis had to use the kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance kb_key_(cryptography) and thus the del kb_code to erase the previous kb_character_(computing) . because of this , kb_declination kb_video terminals ( by default ) sent the del kb_code for the kb_key_(cryptography) marked `` backspace '' while the kb_key_(cryptography) marked `` kb_delete_key '' sent an kb_escape_character sequence , while many kb_other_(philosophy) terminals sent bs for the backspace kb_key_(cryptography) . the kb_unix kb_computer_terminal driver could only use kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_code to back up , this could kb_beryllium kb_set_(mythology) to bs `` or '' del , but not both , resulting in kb_a very kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) period of annoyance where you had to correct kb_it depending on what kb_computer_terminal you were using ( kb_modern_history kb_electron_shells using kb_readline kb_natural_language_understanding both kb_code_(cryptography) ) . the assumption that no kb_key_(cryptography) sent kb_a bs caused control+h to kb_beryllium used for kb_other_(philosophy) purposes , such as kb_a `` help '' kb_command_economy in emacs .many more of the control kb_code_(cryptography) have been given meanings quite different from their original ones . the `` escape '' kb_character_(computing) ( esc , kb_code 27 ) , for example , was kb_intention originally to allow sending kb_other_(philosophy) control kb_character_(computing) as literals instead of invoking their kb_meaning_(linguistics) . this is the same kb_meaning_(linguistics) of `` escape '' encountered in url encodings , kb_c_(programming_language) kb_string_section , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_systems_analysis where certain kb_character_(computing) have kb_a reserved kb_meaning_(linguistics) . over kb_time_(magazine) this kb_meaning_(linguistics) has been co-opted and has eventually been changed . in kb_modern_history use , an esc sent to the kb_computer_terminal usually indicates the start of kb_a kb_command_economy sequence usually in the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_a so-called `` kb_ansi_escape_code kb_code '' ( or , more properly , kb_a `` kb_control_sequence_introducer sequence introducer '' ) from ecma-48 ( kb_1972_wimbledon_championships ) and its successors , beginning with esc followed by kb_a `` < nowiki > [ < /nowiki > '' ( left-bracket ) kb_character_(computing) . an esc sent from the kb_computer_terminal is most often used as an kb_out-of-band_data kb_character_(computing) used to terminate an operation , as in the kb_text_editor_and_corrector and kb_vi text editors . in kb_graphical_user_interface kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) interface ( kb_graphical_user_interface ) and kb_window_(computing) kb_systems_analysis , esc generally kb_causes_of_autism an kb_application_(computing) to abort its kb_electric_current operation or to kb_exit_(system_call) ( terminate ) altogether .the inherent ambiguity of many control kb_character_(computing) , combined with their historical usage , created kb_problems_(aristotle) when transferring `` kb_plain_text text '' kb_file_(tool) between kb_systems_analysis . the best example of this is the kb_newline problem on various operating kb_systems_analysis . kb_teleprinter machines required that kb_a kb_line_(geometry) of text kb_beryllium terminated with both `` kb_carriage_return return '' ( which moves the printhead to kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the kb_line_(geometry) ) and `` kb_line_feed '' ( which advances the paper kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_line_(geometry) without moving the printhead ) . the kb_toponymy `` kb_carriage_return return '' comes from the kb_fact that on kb_a kb_manual_(music) kb_typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the kb_positional_notation where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary . the entire carriage had to kb_beryllium pushed ( returned ) to the kb_right-wing_politics in kb_order_(biology) to kb_positional_notation the kb_left-wing_politics margin of the paper for the kb_next kb_line_(geometry) .kb_declination operating kb_systems_analysis ( kb_os/8 , kb_rt-11 , kb_rsx-11 , kb_rsts/e , kb_tops-10 , etc . ) used both kb_character_(computing) to kb_mark_waugh the end of kb_a kb_line_(geometry) kb_sulfate that the console kb_analyzer ( originally kb_teleprinter machines ) would kb_cold_working . by the kb_time_(magazine) so-called `` kb_glass ttys '' ( later called crts or terminals ) came along , the kb_fan_convention was kb_sulfate kb_water_well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the kb_fan_convention . when kb_gary_kildall kildall created kb_cp/m kb_he_(letter) was inspired by some kb_command_economy kb_line_(geometry) interface conventions used in kb_declination 's kb_rt-11 . until the introduction of kb_pc_dos kb_dos in 1981 , kb_ibm had no kb_hand in this because their 1970s operating kb_systems_analysis used kb_ebcdic instead of kb_ascii and they were oriented toward punch-card input and kb_line_(geometry) printer output on which the kb_concept of kb_carriage_return return was meaningless . kb_ibm 's kb_pc_dos kb_dos ( also marketed as kb_ms-dos by kb_microsoft ) inherited the kb_fan_convention by kb_virtue of kb_being loosely based on kb_cp/m , and kb_microsoft_windows inherited kb_it from kb_ms-dos .unfortunately , requiring kb_2_(number) kb_character_(computing) to kb_mark_waugh the end of kb_a kb_line_(geometry) introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each kb_character_(computing) when encountered alone . to simplify matters kb_plain_text text kb_big_data streams , including kb_file_(tool) , on kb_multics used kb_line_feed ( lf ) alone as kb_a kb_line_(geometry) kb_terminator_(solar) . kb_unix and kb_unix-like kb_systems_analysis , and kb_amiga kb_systems_analysis , kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome this kb_fan_convention from kb_multics . the original kb_macintosh_os , kb_apple_dos , and kb_prodos , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , used kb_carriage_return return ( cr ) alone as kb_a kb_line_(geometry) kb_terminator_(solar) ; however , since kb_apple_inc. replaced these operating kb_systems_analysis with the unix-based kb_macos kb_operating_system system , they now use kb_line_feed ( lf ) as kb_water_well . the kb_radio shack kb_trs-80 also used kb_a lone cr to terminate lines .computers attached to the kb_arpanet included machines running operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_tops-10 and kb_tops-20#tenex using cr-lf kb_line_(geometry) endings , machines running operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_multics using lf kb_line_(geometry) endings , and machines running operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_os/360 that represented lines as kb_a kb_character_(computing) count followed by the kb_character_(computing) of the kb_line_(geometry) and that used kb_ebcdic rather than kb_ascii . the kb_telnet protocol kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity an kb_ascii `` kb_network_virtual_terminal virtual kb_computer_terminal '' ( nvt ) , kb_sulfate that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and kb_character_(computing) sets could kb_beryllium kb_catalyst_support by transmitting kb_a standard text kb_text_formatting over the network . kb_telnet used kb_ascii along with cr-lf kb_line_(geometry) endings , and software using kb_other_(philosophy) conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt . the kb_file_transfer_protocol transfer protocol kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome the kb_telnet protocol , including use of the kb_network_virtual_terminal virtual kb_computer_terminal , for use when transmitting commands and transferring kb_big_data in the default kb_ascii kb_musical_mode . this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols , and to kb_other_(philosophy) network protocols , such as those used for e-mail and the kb_world_wide_web kb_world_wide_web , on kb_systems_analysis not using the nvt 's cr-lf line-ending kb_fan_convention .the pdp-6 monitor , and its pdp-10 successor kb_tops-10 , used control-z ( sub ) as an kb_end-of-file indication for input from kb_a kb_computer_terminal . some operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_cp/m tracked file kb_length only in units of kb_disk_(mathematics) kb_periodic_table_block and used control-z to kb_mark_waugh the end of the actual text in the file . for these reasons , eof , or kb_end-of-file , was used colloquially and conventionally as kb_a kb_three-letter_acronym kb_acronym for control-z instead of substitute . the end-of-text kb_code ( kb_end-of-text_character ) , also known as kb_control-c , was inappropriate for kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of reasons , while using kb_carboxybenzyl as the kb_control_code kb_code to end kb_a file is analogous to kb_it ending the kb_alphabet and serves as kb_a very convenient kb_mnemonic_device kb_aid . kb_a kb_history common and still prevalent kb_fan_convention uses the kb_end-of-text_character kb_code kb_fan_convention to interrupt and halt kb_a kb_program_(computing) via an input kb_data_stream , usually from kb_a keyboard .in kb_vitamin_c library and kb_unix conventions , the kb_null_character is used to terminate text kb_string_section ; such null-terminated kb_string_section can kb_beryllium known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz , where here kb_carboxybenzyl stands for `` kb_0_(number) '' .kb_other_(philosophy) representations might kb_beryllium used by specialist equipment , for example kb_iso_2047 graphics or kb_hexadecimal kb_grammatical_number .kb_code_(cryptography) 20 to 7e , known as the printable kb_character_(computing) , represent kb_letter_(alphabet) , digits , punctuation marks , and kb_a few kb_miscellaneous_symbols kb_symbols . there are 95 printable kb_character_(computing) in total .kb_code 20 , the `` kb_space '' kb_character_(computing) , denotes the kb_space between kb_lexical_semantics , as produced by the kb_space bar of kb_a keyboard . since the kb_space kb_character_(computing) is considered an invisible graphic ( rather than kb_a kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) ) kb_it is listed in the table kb_#ecclesiastical_history instead of in the previous kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) .kb_code 7f corresponds to the non-printable `` kb_delete_key '' ( del ) kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) and is therefore omitted from this chart ; kb_it is covered in the previous kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) 's chart . kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet versions of kb_ascii used the up kb_arrow_(weapon) instead of the kb_caret ( 5e ) and the kb_left-wing_politics kb_arrow_(weapon) instead of the kb_underscore ( 5f ) .] ]kb_ascii was kb_first_trimester used commercially during 1963 as kb_a seven-bit kb_teleprinter kb_code for kb_american_telephone_&_telegraph & kb_telegraph 's twx ( teletypewriter exchange ) network . twx originally used the kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet five-bit kb_ita2 , which was also used by the competing kb_telex kb_teleprinter system . kb_robert_william_bemer bemer introduced features such as the kb_escape_character sequence . kb_histidine kb_kingdom_of_great_britain colleague kb_hugh_mcgregor_ross mcgregor ross helped to popularize this kb_cold_working according to bemer , `` kb_sulfate much kb_sulfate that the kb_code that was to become kb_ascii was kb_first_trimester called the `` bemer–ross kb_code '' in kb_europe '' . because of kb_histidine extensive kb_cold_working on kb_ascii , bemer has been called `` the kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) of kb_ascii '' .on kb_march 11 , kb_from_the_earth_to_the_moon_(miniseries)#episodes , kb_united_states_navy kb_president_of_the_united_states kb_lyndon_b._johnson b. johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the kb_united_states_federal_government kb_sovereign_state kb_federal_government_of_the_united_states support kb_ascii , stating :kb_iodine have also approved recommendations of the kb_united_states_secretary_of_commerce of commerce [ kb_martin_luther h. hodges ] regarding kb_corporate_social_responsibility for recording the standard kb_code for kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) interchange on kb_magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in kb_apollo_guidance_computer operations .all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the kb_federal_government_of_the_united_states kb_inventory on and after july 1 , 1969 , must have the capability to use the standard kb_code for kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) interchange and the formats prescribed by the kb_magnetic tape and kb_punched_tape tape kb_corporate_social_responsibility when these kb_medes are used .kb_ascii was the most common kb_character_encoding on the kb_world_wide_web kb_world_wide_web until december kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final , when kb_utf-8 encoding surpassed kb_it ; kb_utf-8 is kb_backward_compatibility compatible with kb_ascii .as kb_apollo_guidance_computer kb_technology kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) throughout the kb_world_war_ii , different kb_standardization and corporations kb_adaptation many variations of kb_ascii to facilitate the expression of non-english languages that used roman-based alphabets . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) could kb_class_(biology) some of these variations as `` kb_ascii extensions '' , although some misuse that kb_terminology to represent all variants , including those that do not preserve kb_ascii 's character-map in the 7-bit range . furthermore , the kb_ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as kb_ascii .from early in its development , kb_ascii was kb_intention to kb_beryllium just kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of several national variants of an international kb_character_(computing) kb_code standard .kb_other_(philosophy) international kb_standardization have ratified kb_character_(computing) encodings such as kb_iso_646 ( 1967 ) that are kb_identical_particles or nearly kb_identical_particles to kb_ascii , with extensions for kb_character_(computing) outside the kb_english_alphabet and kb_symbols used outside the united kb_sovereign_state , such as the kb_symbol for the kb_united_kingdom kb_kingdom_(biology) 's kb_pound_sterling ( kb_pound_sterling ) . almost every kb_country_music needed an adapted version of kb_ascii , since kb_ascii suited the needs of only the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) and kb_a few kb_other_(philosophy) countries . for example , kb_canada had its own version that kb_catalyst_support kb_france kb_character_(computing) .many kb_other_(philosophy) countries kb_adaptation variants of kb_ascii to include non-english kb_letter_(alphabet) ( e.g . kb_é , kb_ñ , kb_ß , kb_ł ) , kb_aruban_florin kb_symbols ( e.g . kb_pound_sterling , kb_¥ ) , etc . kb_episcopal_see also kb_yuscii ( yugoslavia ) .kb_it would share most kb_character_(computing) in common , but assign kb_other_(philosophy) locally useful kb_character_(computing) to several kb_code points reserved for `` national use '' . however , the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii-1963 and kb_international_organization_for_standardization 's kb_first_trimester acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused kb_ascii 's choices for the national use kb_character_(computing) to seem to kb_beryllium kb_de_facto kb_corporate_social_responsibility for the kb_world_war_ii , causing kb_confusion and incompatibility once kb_other_(philosophy) countries did begin to make their own assignments to these kb_code points .iso/iec 646 , like kb_ascii , is kb_a 7-bit kb_character_(computing) kb_set_(mythology) . kb_it does not make any additional kb_code_(cryptography) kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance , kb_sulfate the same kb_code points encoded different kb_character_(computing) in different countries . escape kb_code_(cryptography) were kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity to indicate which national variant kb_applied_science to kb_a piece of text , but they were rarely used , kb_sulfate kb_it was often impossible to know what variant to kb_cold_working with and , therefore , which kb_character_(computing) kb_a kb_code represented , and in kb_general_(united_states) , text-processing kb_systems_analysis could kb_coping_(psychology) with only kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) variant anyway .because the bracket and kb_brace_(punctuation) kb_character_(computing) of kb_ascii were assigned to `` national use '' kb_code points that were used for accented kb_letter_(alphabet) in kb_other_(philosophy) national variants of iso/iec 646 , kb_a kb_german_language , kb_france , or kb_sweden , etc . kb_programmer using their national variant of iso/iec 646 , rather than kb_ascii , had to write , and thus kb_walter_read , something such asinstead ofkb_vitamin_c trigraphs were created to solve this problem for kb_ansi_c , although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use . many programmers kept their computers on us-ascii , kb_sulfate plain-text in kb_sweden , kb_german_language etc . ( for example , in e-mail or kb_usenet ) contained `` { , } '' and similar variants in the middle of kb_lexical_semantics , something those programmers got used to . for example , kb_a kb_sweden kb_programmer mailing another kb_programmer asking if they should kb_go_(game) for lunch , could get `` kb_neutron { jag har sm|rg } sar '' as the answer , which should kb_beryllium `` nä jag har smörgåsar '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` no kb_iodine 've got sandwiches '' .eventually , as 8- , kb_16-bit and kb_32-bit ( and later kb_64-bit ) computers began to replace kb_12-bit , kb_18-bit and kb_36-bit computers as the kb_norm_(mathematics) , kb_it became common to use an kb_8-bit kb_byte to store each kb_character_(computing) in kb_memory , providing an opportunity for extended , kb_8-bit relatives of kb_ascii . in most kb_noun_case these kb_adaptation as kb_truth extensions of kb_ascii , leaving the original character-mapping intact , but adding additional kb_character_(computing) definitions after the kb_first_trimester 128 ( i.e. , 7-bit ) kb_character_(computing) .encodings include kb_iscii ( kb_indian_subcontinent ) , kb_viscii ( kb_vietnam ) . although these encodings are sometimes referred to as kb_ascii , kb_truth kb_ascii is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity strictly only by the kb_american_national_standards_institute standard .most early home kb_computer_systems

kahrs said that `` our animators can change things , actually erase away the cg underlayer if they want , and change the profile of the kb_arm . ''kb_3d_computer_graphics animation is kb_digital_media modeled and manipulated by an kb_animator . the kb_animator usually starts by creating kb_a 3d kb_polygon_mesh to manipulate . kb_a mesh typically includes many kb_vertex_(geometry) that are connected by edges and faces , which give the visual kb_appearance_(philosophy) of kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism to kb_a 3d kb_space_debris or 3d environment . sometimes , the mesh is given an internal kb_digital_data skeletal kb_structure called an kb_armature_(computer_animation) that can kb_beryllium used to control the mesh by weighting the kb_vertex_(geometry) . this process is called rigging and can kb_beryllium used in conjunction with keyframes to create kb_movement_(sign_language) .kb_other_(philosophy) techniques can kb_beryllium kb_applied_science , mathematical functions ( e.g. , kb_gravity_(2013_film) , kb_grammatical_particle simulations ) , simulated fur or hair , and effects , kb_fire_(classical_element) and kb_fluid_animationan kb_animator is an kb_artist kb_world_health_organization creates kb_a visual sequence ( or kb_audio-visual if added kb_sound ) of kb_cross-platform_software sequential images that generate the illusion of kb_movement_(sign_language) , that is , an animation . animations are currently in many areas of kb_technology and kb_video , such as kb_film , kb_television , kb_video_games or kb_the_internet kb_internet . generally , these works require the collaboration of several animators . the methods to create these images depend on the kb_animator and kb_carpel that kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) wants to achieve ( with images generated by kb_apollo_guidance_computer , manually ... ) .animators can kb_beryllium divided into animators of kb_character_(computing) ( artists kb_world_health_organization are specialized in the movements , kb_dialogue and acting of the kb_character_(computing) ) and animators of special effects ( for example vehicles , kb_machinery or kb_natural_number kb_phenomenon such as kb_water , kb_snow , kb_rain ) .the creation of non-trivial animation works ( i.e. , longer than kb_a few seconds ) has kb_adaptation as kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_filmmaking , with certain unique aspects . kb_trait_(biology) common to both live-action and animated kb_feature_film kb_adventure_film are labor-intensity and kb_high_middle_ages production costs .the most important difference is that once kb_a kb_film is in the production kb_phase_(matter) , the kb_marginal_cost cost of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) more shot is higher for animated kb_adventure_film than live-action kb_adventure_film . kb_it is relatively easy for kb_a director to kb_amplitude-shift_keying for kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) more kb_take during kb_principal_photography photography of kb_a live-action kb_film , but every kb_take on an animated kb_film must kb_beryllium manually rendered by animators ( although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by kb_modern_history kb_computer_animation ) . kb_it is pointless for kb_a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating kb_a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the kb_film . thus , animation studios starting with kb_walt_disney_animation_studios began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where kb_storyboard artists develop every kb_single_bond scene through storyboards , then handing the kb_film over to the animators only after the production team is kb_satisfiability that all the scenes make kb_word_sense as kb_a whole . while live-action kb_adventure_film are now also storyboarded , they enjoy more kb_latitude to depart from storyboards ( i.e. , kb_real-time_computing improvisation ) .another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain kb_a kb_film 's consistency from start to finish , even as kb_adventure_film have grown longer and teams have grown larger . animators , like all artists , necessarily have kb_individual kb_art_movement , but must subordinate their individuality in kb_a kb_consistent way to whatever kb_carpel is employed on kb_a kb_particular kb_film . since the early 1980s , teams of about 500 to 600 kb_people_(american_magazine) , of whom 50 to 70 are animators , typically have created feature-length animated kb_adventure_film . kb_it is relatively easy for kb_2_(number) or kb_triliteral artists to match their kb_art_movement ; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult .this problem is usually solved by having kb_a separate kb_group_(periodic_table) of visual development artists develop an overall kb_look_(american_magazine) and palette for each kb_film before animation begins . kb_character_(computing) designers on the visual development team draw kb_rutherford_model sheets to show how each kb_character_(computing) should kb_look_(american_magazine) like with different facial expressions , posed in different positions , and viewed from different angles . on traditionally animated projects , maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators kb_episcopal_see how kb_character_(computing) would kb_look_(american_magazine) from different angles .unlike live-action kb_adventure_film , animated kb_adventure_film were traditionally kb_adaptation beyond the synopsis stage through the kb_storyboard kb_text_formatting ; the kb_storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the kb_film . in the early kb_1960s_in_the_united_states , animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write kb_screenplays ( while also continuing to use story departments ) and kb_screenplays had become commonplace for animated kb_adventure_film by the late 1980s .criticism of animation has been common in kb_medes and kb_film since its kb_inception_(film) . with its popularity , kb_a kb_prespa_lake amount of criticism has arisen , especially animated kb_feature_film kb_adventure_film . many concerns of kb_cultural_anthropology kb_representation_(arts) , kb_psychology effects on children have been brought up around the animation kb_industry , which has remained rather kb_politics_of_albania unchanged and stagnant since its kb_inception_(film) into kb_mainstream_(terminology) kb_albanian_culture .as with any kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_medes , animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field . the original awards for animation were presented by the kb_academy_of_motion_picture_arts_and_sciences kb_motion_(physics) picture kb_arts and kb_sciences for animated shorts from the year 1932 , during the 5th kb_academy_awards kb_function_(biology) . the kb_first_trimester winner of the kb_academy_awards was the short `` kb_flowers_and_trees and kb_trees '' , kb_a production by kb_walt_disney_productions kb_walt_disney_animation_studios productions . the kb_academy_awards for kb_a feature-length animated kb_motion_(physics) picture was only instituted for the year 2001 , and awarded during the 74th kb_academy_awards in 2002. kb_it was won by the kb_film `` kb_shrek '' , produced by kb_dreamworks and kb_pacific_data_images images . disney/pixar have produced the most kb_adventure_film either to win or kb_beryllium nominated for the award . the kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of both awards can kb_beryllium obtained here :several kb_other_(philosophy) countries have instituted an award for best-animated kb_feature_film as part of their national kb_film awards : kb_africa_movie_academy_award_for_best_animation kb_academy_awards for best animation ( since kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 ) , kb_bafta_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film ( since kb_winter_olympics_2006 ) , kb_césar_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film ( since 2011 ) , kb_golden_rooster_award_for_best_animation award for best animation ( since 1981 ) , kb_goya_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film ( since 1989 ) , kb_japan_academy_prize_for_animation_of_the_year prize for animation of the year ( since kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final ) , kb_national_film_award_for_best_animated_film kb_film award for best animated kb_film ( since kb_winter_olympics_2006 ) . also since kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final , the kb_asia_pacific_screen_award_for_best_animated_feature_film kb_screening_(medicine) award for best animated kb_feature_film has been awarded at the kb_asia_pacific_screen_awards kb_screening_(medicine) awards . since kb_2009_in_science , the kb_european_film_awards awards have awarded the kb_european_film_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film .the kb_annie_award award is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation . unlike the kb_academy_awards , the annie awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any kb_other_(philosophy) field of technical and artistic endeavor . they were re-organized in kb_1992_davis_cup to create kb_a kb_new_world field for best animated kb_i_shot_andy_warhol . the 1990s winners were dominated by walt kb_walt_disney_animation_studios , however , newer studios , kb_light-emitting_diode by kb_pixar & kb_dreamworks , have now begun to consistently vie for this award . the kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of awardees is as follows :category : cartooningcategory : kb_article_(grammar) containing kb_video kb_clips_(software)category : kb_film and kb_video technologyapollokb_apollo_program ( kb_attica , kb_ionic_crystal , and kb_homeric_greek : , `` apollōn '' ( ) ;

, `` phoibos '' ) , literally `` bright '' . kb_it was very commonly used by both the kb_greeks and kb_roman_empire for kb_apollo_program 's role as the kb_god of kb_light . like kb_other_(philosophy) kb_ancient_greek kb_deities , kb_he_(letter) had kb_a kb_grammatical_number of others kb_applied_science to him , reflecting the kb_variety_(magazine) of roles , duties , and aspects ascribed to the kb_god . however , while kb_apollo_program has kb_a great kb_grammatical_number of appellations in kb_greek_mythology , only kb_a few occur in kb_latin_literature .kb_apollo_program 's birthplace was kb_cynthus cynthus on the kb_island of kb_deloskb_delphi and kb_actiumkb_apollo_program was worshipped throughout the kb_roman_empire . in the traditionally kb_celts lands , kb_he_(letter) was most often seen as kb_a kb_healing and kb_sun kb_god . kb_he_(letter) was often equated with kb_list_of_celtic_godsthe kb_cult_(religious_practice) centers of kb_apollo_program in kb_greece , kb_delphi and kb_delos , date from the 8th century bce . the kb_delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to kb_artemis , kb_apollo_program 's twin sister . at kb_delphi , kb_apollo_program was kb_veneration as the slayer of kb_pytho . for the kb_greeks , kb_apollo_program was all the kb_deity in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) and through the kb_century_(cricket) kb_he_(letter) acquired different functions which could originate from different kb_deity . in kb_archaic_greece kb_greece kb_he_(letter) was the kb_prophet , the kb_oracular kb_god kb_world_health_organization in older times was connected with `` kb_healing '' . in kb_classical_greece kb_he_(letter) was the kb_god of kb_light and of kb_music , but in popular kb_religion kb_he_(letter) had kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_function_(biology) to keep away kb_evil . kb_walter_burkert burkert discerned kb_triliteral components in the kb_prehistory of kb_apollo_program kb_achilles#worship , which kb_he_(letter) termed `` kb_a dorian-northwest kb_ancient_greek component , kb_a cretan-minoan component , and kb_a syro-hittite component . ''from kb_histidine kb_eastern_hemisphere kb_evolution kb_apollo_program brought the kb_art of kb_inspection of `` kb_symbols and kb_omen '' ( σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα : `` sēmeia kai terata '' ) , and of the kb_observation of the omens of the days . the inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from kb_anatolia . the kb_ritualism_in_the_church_of_england belonged to kb_apollo_program from kb_operation_barbarossa beginning . the kb_greeks created the kb_legalism_(western_philosophy) , the supervision of the kb_order_(biology) of the kb_deity , and the demand for kb_moderation and kb_harmony . kb_apollo_program became the kb_god of shining youth , kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_beauty , kb_fine_(penalty) kb_arts , kb_philosophy , kb_moderation , spiritual-life , the protector of

of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to kb_cure kb_disease . later the kb_greeks knew the original kb_meaning_(linguistics) of the relevant song `` kb_paean '' ( ) . the magicians were also called `` seer-doctors '' ( ) , and they used an ecstatic prophetic kb_art which was used exactly by the kb_god kb_apollo_program at the kb_oracle_machine .in the `` kb_iliad '' , kb_apollo_program is the healer under the kb_deity , but kb_he_(letter) is also the bringer of kb_disease and kb_death with kb_histidine arrows , similar to the kb_function_(biology) of the kb_vedas kb_god of kb_disease kb_rudra . kb_he_(letter) sends kb_a kb_plague_(disease) ( ) to the kb_achaeans_(homer) . the kb_god kb_world_health_organization sends kb_a kb_disease can also prevent kb_it ; therefore , when kb_it kb_organ_stop , they make kb_a purifying ceremony and offer him kb_a kb_hecatomb to ward off kb_evil . when the kb_oath of kb_histidine kb_priest appeases , they pray and with kb_a song they call their own kb_god , the `` kb_paean '' .some common epithets of kb_apollo_program as kb_a healer are `` paion '' ( literally `` healer '' or `` helper '' ) `` epikourios '' ( , `` succouring '' ) , `` oulios '' ( , `` healer , baleful '' ) and `` loimios '' ( , `` of kb_the_plague kb_plague_(disease) '' ) . in kb_classical_antiquity , kb_histidine kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_function_(biology) in popular kb_religion was to keep away kb_evil , and was therefore called `` apotropaios '' ( , `` averting kb_evil '' ) and `` alexikakos '' ( `` keeping off ill '' ; from kb_verb + kb_noun ) . in later writers , kb_the_word_(free_love) word , usually spelled `` kb_paean '' , becomes kb_a mere kb_epithet of kb_apollo_program in kb_histidine capacity as kb_a kb_god of kb_healing .kb_homer illustrated paeon the kb_god , and the song both of kb_apotropaic_magic kb_thanksgiving_day_(united_states) or triumph . such songs were originally addressed to kb_apollo_program , and afterwards to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_deity : to kb_dionysus , to kb_helios , to kb_apollo_program 's son kb_asclepius the healer . about the 4th century bce , the kb_paean became merely kb_a kb_chemical_formula of adulation ; its kb_space_debris was either to implore protection against kb_disease and misfortune , or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered . kb_it was in this way that kb_apollo_program had become recognised as the kb_god of kb_music . kb_apollo_program 's role as the slayer of the kb_python_(mythology) kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_histidine kb_continental_association with kb_battle_abbey and victory ; hence kb_it became the kb_roman_empirethe connection with the dorians and their initiation festival `` kb_apellai '' is reinforced by the month `` apellaios '' in northwest kb_ancient_greek calendars . the family-festival was dedicated to kb_apollo_program ( kb_dorians : ) . `` apellaios '' is the month of these rites , and apellon is the `` megistos kb_kouros '' ( the great kb_kouros ) . however kb_it can explain only the kb_dorians kb_type_(biology) of the kb_toponymy , which is connected with the kb_ancient_macedonian_language word `` kb_pella '' ( kb_pella ) , `` stone '' . stones played an important part in the kb_cult_(religious_practice) of the kb_god , especially in the kb_oracular shrine of kb_delphi ( kb_omphalos ) .the `` kb_homeric_hymn '' represents kb_apollo_program as kb_a kb_northern_hemisphere intruder . kb_histidine kb_arrival_(abba_album) must have occurred during the `` kb_greek_dark_ages ages '' that followed the destruction of the kb_mycenaean_civilization , and kb_histidine conflict with kb_gaia ( mother kb_earth ) was represented by the legend of kb_histidine slaying her kb_decay_product the serpent kb_python_(mythology) .the kb_earth kb_deity had kb_power_(physics) over the ghostly kb_world_war_ii , and kb_it is believed that she was the kb_deity behind the kb_oracle . the older tales mentioned kb_2_(number) dragons kb_world_health_organization were perhaps intentionally conflated . kb_a female dragon kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_delphyne ( ; kb_cf. . , `` kb_womb '' ) , and kb_a kb_male serpent kb_typhon ( ; from , `` to smoke '' ) , the adversary of kb_zeus in the kb_titanomachy , kb_world_health_organization the narrators confused with kb_python_(mythology) . kb_python_(mythology) was the good kb_daemon_(classical_mythology) ( ἀγαθὸς δαίμων ) of the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina as kb_it appears in kb_minoan_civilization kb_religion , but she was represented as kb_a dragon , as often happens in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_european_folklore as kb_water_well as in the kb_east_africa .kb_apollo_program and kb_histidine sister kb_artemis can bring kb_death with their arrows . the kb_human_fertilization that diseases and kb_death come from invisible kb_shot_(filmmaking) sent by kb_supernatural beings , or magicians is common in kb_germanic_languages and kb_norse_mythology kb_mythology . in kb_greek_mythology kb_artemis was the kb_leader ( , `` kb_hegemon '' ) of the kb_nymphs , kb_world_health_organization had similar functions with the kb_norse_mythology kb_elf . the `` elf-shot '' originally indicated kb_disease or kb_death attributed to the kb_elf , but kb_it was later attested denoting stone arrow-heads which were used by witches to harm kb_people_(american_magazine) , and also for kb_healing rituals .the kb_vedas kb_rudra has some similar functions with kb_apollo_program . the terrible kb_god is called `` the kb_archery '' , and the kb_bow_river is also an attribute of kb_shiva . kb_rudra could bring diseases with kb_histidine arrows , but kb_he_(letter) was able to free kb_people_(american_magazine)

from the kb_mycenaean_greece age . in historical times , the kb_priests of kb_delphi were called kb_labëria ( kb_alkyl ) yadai , `` the double-axe men '' , which indicates kb_minoan_civilization kb_evolution . the double-axe , kb_labrys , was the holy kb_symbol of the kb_crete kb_labyrinth . the kb_homeric_hymn adds that kb_apollo_program appeared as kb_a kb_dolphin and carried kb_crete kb_priests to kb_delphi , where they evidently transferred their kb_religion practices . `` kb_apollo_program delphinios '' or `` delphidios '' was kb_a sea-god especially worshiped in kb_crete and in the kb_islands_(regional_unit) . kb_apollo_program 's sister kb_artemis , kb_world_health_organization was the kb_ancient_greek kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of hunting , is kb_interpretatio_graeca with

accompanied by the `` mister of the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing '' , kb_a kb_male kb_god of hunting kb_world_health_organization had the kb_bow_river as kb_histidine attribute . kb_histidine original kb_toponymy is unknown , but kb_it seems that kb_he_(letter) was absorbed by the more popular kb_apollo_program , kb_world_health_organization stood by the virgin `` mistress of the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing '' , becoming her brother .the kb_old_testament kb_oracle_machine in kb_delphi seem to kb_beryllium connected with kb_a local kb_tradition of the kb_priesthood , and there is not clear kb_evidence_(law) that kb_a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina . this kb_light-emitting_diode some scholars to the kb_eschatocol that kb_pythia carried on the rituals in kb_a kb_consistent procedure through many kb_century_(cricket) , according to the local kb_tradition . in that regard , the mythical seeress kb_sibyl of kb_sultanate_of_rum kb_evolution , with her ecstatic kb_art , looks unrelated to the kb_oracle itself . however , the kb_ancient_greek_astronomy is referring to the kb_existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves , which seem to kb_beryllium kb_confirmation by recent studies .kb_plato describes the priestesses of kb_delphi and kb_dodona as frenzied women , obsessed by `` kb_mania '' ( , `` kb_frenzy '' ) , kb_a kb_ancient_greek word kb_he_(letter) connected with `` mantis '' ( , `` kb_prophet '' ) . frenzied women like sibyls from whose lips the kb_god speaks are recorded in the kb_near_east kb_east_africa as kb_mari,_syria in the kb_2nd_millennium_bc bc . although kb_crete had contacts with kb_mari,_syria from 2000 bc , there is no kb_evidence_(law) that the ecstatic prophetic kb_art existed during the kb_minoan_civilization and kb_mycenaean_greece ages . kb_it is more probable that this kb_art was introduced later from kb_anatoliakb_a non-greek kb_evolution of kb_apollo_program has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) been assumed in scholarship . the kb_toponymy of kb_apollo_program 's mother kb_leto has kb_lydian_language kb_evolution , and she was worshipped on the coasts of kb_anatolia . the inspiration kb_oracular kb_cult_(religious_practice) was probably introduced into kb_greece from kb_anatolia , which is the kb_evolution of kb_sibyl , and where existed some of the oldest kb_oracular shrines . omens , kb_symbols , purifications , and exorcisms appear in kb_old_testament assyro-babylonian kb_literature , and these rituals were kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) into the kb_roman_empire of the kb_hittites . in kb_a kb_hittites text is mentioned that the kb_king invited kb_a babylonian priestess for kb_a certain `` purification '' .kb_a similar story is mentioned by kb_plutarch . kb_he_(letter) writes that the kb_crete kb_prophet kb_epimenides purified kb_athens after the pollution brought by the kb_alcmeonidae , and that the kb_prophet 's expertise in sacrifices and kb_reform_judaism of funeral practices were of great help to kb_solon in kb_histidine kb_reform_judaism of the kb_athenian kb_state_of_matter . the story indicates that kb_epimenides was probably heir to the kb_shamanism#asia religions of kb_asia_(roman_province) , and proves , together with the kb_homeric_hymn , that kb_crete had kb_a resisting kb_religion up to historical times . kb_it seems that these rituals were dormant in kb_greece , and they were reinforced when the kb_greeks migrated to kb_anatolia .kb_homer pictures kb_apollo_program on the side of the kb_troy , fighting against the kb_achaeans_(homer) , during the kb_trojan_war . kb_he_(letter) is pictured as kb_a terrible kb_god , less trusted by the kb_greeks than kb_other_(philosophy) kb_deity . the kb_god seems to kb_beryllium related to `` appaliunas '' , kb_a tutelary kb_god of kb_wilusa ( kb_troy ) in kb_anatolia , but kb_the_word_(free_love) word is not complete . the stones found in front of the gates of kb_homeric kb_troy were the kb_symbols of kb_apollo_program . kb_a kb_western_esotericism kb_sultanate_of_rum kb_evolution may also kb_beryllium bolstered by references to the parallel kb_achilles#worship of `` artimus '' ( kb_artemis ) and `` qλdãns '' , whose kb_toponymy may kb_beryllium kb_cognate with the kb_hittites and kb_dorians kb_theory_of_forms , in surviving kb_lydian_language kb_literature '' . '' however , recent scholars have kb_casting_(metalworking) doubt on the identification of `` qλdãns '' with kb_apollo_program .the kb_greeks gave to him the kb_toponymy `` kb_agyieus '' as the protector kb_god of kb_state_school places and houses kb_world_health_organization wards off kb_evil , and kb_histidine kb_symbol was kb_a tapered stone or kb_column_of_antoninus_pius . however , while usually kb_ancient_greek festivals were celebrated at the kb_full_moon kb_moon , all the feasts of kb_apollo_program were celebrated at the seventh day of the month , and the kb_emphasis_(typography) given to that day ( `` sibutu '' ) indicates kb_a babylonian kb_evolution .the kb_bronze_age#age_sub-divisions kb_bronze_age ( from 1700 to 1200 bce ) kb_hittites and kb_hurrian `` kb_aplu_(deity) '' was kb_a kb_god of kb_plague_(disease) , invoked during kb_plague_(disease) years . here we have an kb_apotropaic_magic situation , where kb_a kb_god originally bringing kb_the_plague kb_plague_(disease) was invoked to end kb_it . kb_aplu_(deity) , kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` the son of '' , was kb_a kb_title given to the kb_god kb_nergal , kb_world_health_organization was linked to the babylonian kb_solar_deity the kb_sun kb_shamash . kb_homer interprets kb_apollo_program as kb_a terrible kb_god ( ) kb_world_health_organization brings kb_death and kb_disease with kb_histidine arrows , but kb_world_health_organization can also heal , possessing kb_a kb_magic_(supernatural) kb_art that separates him from the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_ancient_greek kb_deity . in `` kb_iliad '' , kb_histidine kb_priest prays to `` kb_apollo_smintheus '' , the kb_mouse kb_god kb_world_health_organization retains an older kb_agriculture kb_function_(biology) as the protector from field rats . all these functions , including the kb_function_(biology) of the healer-god kb_paeanunusually among the kb_summer_olympics kb_deities , kb_apollo_program had kb_2_(number) kb_cult_(religious_practice) sites that had widespread influence : kb_delos and kb_delphi . in kb_cult_(religious_practice) practice , kb_delos kb_apollo_program and kb_pythian_apollo kb_apollo_program ( the kb_apollo_program of kb_delphi ) were kb_sulfate distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality . kb_apollo_program 's kb_cult_(religious_practice) was already fully established when written sources commenced , about 650 bce . kb_apollo_program became extremely important to the kb_ancient_greek kb_world_war_ii as an kb_oracular kb_deity in the kb_archaic_greece period , and the kb_frequency of kb_theophoric_names names such as `` apollodorus '' or `` apollonios '' and cities kb_english_alphabet#letter_names `` kb_sozopol '' testify to kb_histidine popularity . kb_oracular sanctuaries to kb_apollo_program were established in kb_other_(philosophy) sites . in the 2nd and 3rd century kb_council_of_europe , those at kb_didyma and kb_clarus pronounced the so-called `` theological kb_oracle_machine '' , in which kb_apollo_program confirms that all kb_deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing , highest kb_deity . `` in the 3rd century , kb_apollo_program fell silent . kb_julian_the_apostate apostatekb_apollo_program had kb_a famous kb_oracle in kb_delphi , and kb_other_(philosophy) notable ones in kb_clarus and kb_branchidae . kb_histidine kb_oracular shrine in kb_abae in kb_phocis , where kb_he_(letter) bore the toponymic kb_epithet `` kb_abaeus '' ( , `` kb_apollon_smyrni_f.c. abaios '' ) , was important enough to kb_beryllium consulted by kb_croesus .kb_histidine kb_oracular shrines include :kb_oracle_machine were also given by sons of kb_apollo_program .many kb_egyptian_temple were dedicated to kb_apollo_program in kb_greece and the kb_greek_colonies . they show the kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) of the kb_cult_(religious_practice) of kb_apollo_program and the kb_evolution of the kb_ancient_greek kb_architecture , which was mostly based on the rightness of kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism and on mathematical kb_foreign_relations_of_albania . some of the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century kb_egyptian_temple , especially in kb_crete , do not belong to any kb_ancient_greek kb_order_(biology) . kb_it seems that the kb_first_trimester peripteral kb_egyptian_temple were rectangular wooden kb_structural_analysis . the different wooden kb_chemical_element were considered kb_divinity , and their kb_theory_of_forms were preserved in the kb_marble or stone kb_chemical_element of the kb_egyptian_temple of kb_doric_order . the kb_greeks used standard types because they believed that the kb_world_war_ii of kb_object_relations_theory was kb_a series of typical kb_theory_of_forms which could kb_beryllium represented in several instances . the kb_egyptian_temple should kb_beryllium canonic , and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection . from the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century times there were certain kb_biological_rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle kb_buildings . the kb_first_trimester kb_buildings were built narrowly in kb_order_(biology) to hold the roof , and when the kb_dimensional_analysis changed some mathematical kb_foreign_relations_of_albania became necessary in kb_order_(biology) to keep the original kb_theory_of_forms . this probably influenced the kb_theory of kb_grammatical_number of kb_pythagoras , kb_world_health_organization believed that behind the kb_appearance_(philosophy) of things there was the permanent kb_principle_(chemistry) of kb_mathematics .the kb_doric_order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century bc but there was kb_a mathematical problem regarding the kb_positional_notation of the triglyphs , which could n't kb_beryllium solved without changing the original kb_theory_of_forms . the kb_order_(biology) was almost abandoned for the kb_ionic_order , but the kb_ionic_crystal kb_list_of_australian_capital_cities also posed an kb_insoluble problem at the corner of kb_a kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina . both kb_order_(biology) were abandoned for the kb_corinthian_order kb_order_(biology)when kb_zeus ' wife kb_hera discovered that kb_leto was impregnanted by kb_zeus , she banned kb_leto from giving birth on `` kb_solid_earth '' . in her wanderings , kb_leto sought shelter on many lands , only to kb_beryllium rejected by them . finally , she saw kb_delos , kb_a floating kb_island , which was neither kb_a real kb_island nor kb_a mainland . kb_it is said that kb_apollo_program , still in kb_leto 's kb_womb , had informed kb_histidine mother about kb_delos to put an end to her suffering . kb_leto , when welcomed by kb_delos , gave birth there , clinging to kb_a kb_palm_tree .kb_it is also stated that kb_hera kidnapped kb_eileithyiawhen kb_apollo_program was born clutching kb_a kb_golden_eagle kb_sword , the swans circled kb_delos seven times and the kb_nymphs sang in delight . soon after kb_he_(letter) was born , kb_he_(letter) was washed clean by the goddesses and was covered in kb_white_american garment , with kb_golden_eagle bands fastened around him . since kb_leto was unable to kb_animal_feed the kb_new_world born , kb_themis , the kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of kb_divinity kb_law , fed him the kb_nectar_(plant) , or kb_ragweed . upon tasting the kb_divinity kb_food_industry , kb_apollo_program broke free of the

. this kb_island later became kb_sacred_architecture to kb_apollo_program .kb_apollo_program was born on the seventh day ( , `` hebdomagenes '' ) of the month kb_thargelion —according to delian tradition—or of the month bysios—according to delphian kb_tradition . the seventh and twentieth , the days of the kb_new_world and kb_full_moon kb_moon , were ever afterwards held kb_sacred_architecture to him . mythographers agree that kb_artemis was born kb_first_trimester and subsequently assisted with the birth of kb_apollo_program , or that kb_artemis was born on the kb_island of kb_ortygia and that she helped kb_leto cross the kb_sea_(astronomy) to kb_delos the kb_next day to give birth to kb_apollo_program .as kb_a child , kb_apollo_program is said to have built kb_a kb_foundation_(engineering) and an altar on kb_delos using the horns of the goats that kb_histidine sister kb_artemis hunted . since kb_he_(letter) learnt the kb_art of building when

kb_bath,_somerset in waters of kb_pineios_(thessaly) . there kb_zeus himself performed purification rites on kb_apollo_program . purified , kb_apollo_program was escorted by kb_histidine half sister kb_athena to kb_delphi where the kb_oracular shrine was finally handed over to him by kb_gaea . according to kb_a variation , kb_apollo_program had also travelled to kb_crete , where

the same extent as kb_zeus by mortals . due to this kb_zeus wished to destroy him . but kb_apollo_program requested kb_histidine kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) not to kb_women's_suffrage kb_sulfate ,

, everyone became frenzied with joy . this kb_light-emitting_diode kb_marsyas to think that kb_he_(letter) was better than kb_apollo_program , and kb_he_(letter) challenged the kb_god to kb_a musical contest . the contest was judged by the kb_musesafter they each performed , both were deemed equal until kb_apollo_program decreed they play and sing at the same kb_time_(magazine) . kb_marsyas argued against this , saying that kb_apollo_program would have an advantage . but kb_apollo_program presented the kb_counterpoint that since kb_marsyas played the kb_flute , which needed

wives of the kb_dioscuri ) , kb_athena_parthenos ( turned into kb_a kb_constellation upon her kb_death ) and by some accounts , kb_scylla .additionally , kb_apollo_program fostered and educated kb_2060_chiron , the kb_centaur_(minor_planet) kb_world_health_organization later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods , including kb_apollo_program 's sons . kb_apollo_program also fostered kb_carnus , the son of kb_zeus and kb_europa_(mythology) .kb_marpessa was kidnapped by kb_idas but was loved by kb_apollo_program as kb_water_well . kb_zeus made her choose between them , and she chose kb_idas on the grounds that kb_apollo_program , kb_being kb_immortality , would tire of her when she grew kb_old_testament .kb_sinope_(mythology) , kb_a kb_nymph , was approached by the amorous kb_apollo_program . she made him promise that kb_he_(letter) would kb_ulysses_s._grant to her whatever she would kb_amplitude-shift_keying for , and then cleverly asked him to let her stay kb_a virgin . kb_apollo_program kept kb_histidine promise and went back .kb_bolina was admired by kb_apollo_program but she refused him and jumped into the kb_sea_(astronomy) . to avoid her kb_death , kb_apollo_program turned her into kb_a kb_nymph and let her kb_go_(game) .kb_castalia was kb_a kb_nymph whom kb_apollo_program loved . she fled from him and kb_dove into the kb_castalian_spring at kb_delphi , at the kb_base_(chemistry) of mt . parnassos , which was then kb_english_alphabet#letter_names after her . kb_water from this kb_castalian_spring was kb_sacred_architecture ; kb_it was used to clean the delphian kb_egyptian_temple and inspire the priestesses .kb_cassandra , was kb_a kb_decay_product of kb_hecuba and kb_priam . kb_apollo_program wished to kb_court her . kb_cassandra promised to return kb_histidine kb_love on kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) condition - kb_he_(letter) should give her the kb_power_(physics) to kb_episcopal_see the future . kb_apollo_program fulfilled her wish , but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after . angered that she broke her promise , kb_apollo_program cursed her that even though she would kb_episcopal_see the future , no kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) would ever kb_believe_(tv_series) her prophecies .kb_hestiakb_artemis as the sister of kb_apollo_program , is `` thea apollousa '' , that is , she as kb_a female kb_divinity represented the same idea that kb_apollo_program did as kb_a kb_male kb_divinity . in the pre-hellenic period , their relationship was described as the kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) between husband and wife , and there seems to have been kb_a kb_tradition which actually described kb_artemis as the wife of kb_apollo_program . however , this relationship was never sexual but kb_spirituality , which is why they both are seen kb_being unmarried in the kb_hellenic_periodkb_artemis , like her brother , is kb_weapon with kb_a kb_bow_river and arrows . she is the cause of sudden kb_maternal_death of women . she also is the protector of the kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , especially girls . though she has nothing to do with kb_oracle_machine , kb_music or kb_poetry , she sometimes kb_light-emitting_diode the female kb_greek_chorus on kb_mount_olympus while kb_apollo_program sang . the kb_bay_laurel was kb_sacred_architecture to both . `` kb_artemis daphnaia '' had her kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina among the lacedemonians , at kb_a kb_place_of_articulation called hypsoi . in later times when kb_apollo_program was regarded as kb_identical_particles with the kb_sun or kb_helios , kb_artemis was naturally regarded as selene or the kb_moon .the kb_bay_laurel was kb_sacred_architecture to both . `` kb_apollo_program daphnephoros '' had kb_a kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina in kb_eretria , kb_a `` kb_place_of_articulation where the citizens are to kb_take the oaths .kb_hecate , the kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of kb_witchcraft and kb_magic_(supernatural) , is the kb_chthonic counterpart of kb_apollo_program . they both are cousins , since their mothers - kb_leto and kb_asteria_(titaness)the oldest kb_evidence_(law) found for kb_hecate 's kb_achilles#worship is at kb_apollo_program 's kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina in kb_miletos . there , kb_hecate was taken to kb_beryllium kb_apollo_program 's sister counterpart in the absence of kb_artemis . kb_hecate 's kb_moon kb_nature makes her the kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of the waning kb_moon and contrats and complements , at the same kb_time_(magazine) , kb_apollo_program 's solar kb_nature .as kb_a kb_deity of kb_knowledge_representation and kb_great_power kb_power_(physics) , kb_apollo_program was seen kb_being the kb_male counterpart of kb_athena . kb_being kb_zeus ' favorite children , they were given more powers and duties . kb_apollo_program and kb_athena often took up the role as protectors of cities , and were patrons of some of the important cities . kb_athena was the kb_principle_(chemistry) kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of kb_athens , kb_apollo_program was the kb_principle_(chemistry) kb_god of kb_spartaas patrons of kb_arts , kb_apollo_program and kb_athena were companions of the kb_muses , the former kb_a much more frequent companion than the latter . kb_apollo_program was sometimes called the son of kb_athena and kb_hephaestus due to kb_histidine wise and artistic kb_nature .in the kb_trojan_war , as kb_zeus ' kb_executive_(government) , kb_apollo_program is seen holding the kb_aegis like kb_athena usually does . kb_apollo_program 's decisions were usually approved by kb_histidine sister kb_athena , and they both worked to establish kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law and kb_order_(biology) kb_set_(mythology) forth by kb_zeus .in kb_aeschylus ' `` kb_oresteia '' trilogy , kb_clytemnestra kills her husband , kb_king kb_agamemnon because kb_he_(letter) had sacrificed their kb_decay_product kb_iphigenia to proceed forward with the kb_trojan_war . kb_apollo_program gives an kb_order_(biology) through the kb_oracle at kb_delphi that kb_agamemnon 's son , kb_orestes , is to kill kb_clytemnestra and kb_aegisthus , her lover . kb_orestes and pylades carry out the revenge , and consequently kb_orestes is pursued by the kb_erinyes or furies ( female kb_anthropomorphism of kb_revenge ) .kb_apollo_program and the furies argue about whether the kb_matricide was justified ; kb_apollo_program holds that the kb_chemical_bond of kb_marriage is kb_sacred_architecture and kb_orestes was avenging kb_histidine kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , whereas the kb_erinyes say that the kb_chemical_bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the kb_chemical_bond of kb_marriage . they invade kb_histidine kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina , and kb_he_(letter) drives them away . kb_he_(letter) says that the kb_matter should kb_beryllium brought before kb_athena . kb_apollo_program promises to protect kb_orestes , as kb_orestes has become kb_apollo_program 's kb_supplication . kb_apollo_program advocates kb_orestes at kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial , and ultimately kb_athena kb_biological_rules in favor of kb_apollo_program .the kb_roman_empire kb_achilles#worship of kb_apollo_program was kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome from the kb_greeks . as kb_a quintessentially kb_list_of_greek_mythological_figures , kb_apollo_program had no direct kb_roman_empire kb_cognate , although later kb_roman_empire poets often referred to him as phoebus . there was kb_a kb_tradition that the kb_pythia kb_oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kb_roman_kingdom kb_roman_empire during the reign of kb_tarquinius_superbus superbus .on the occasion of kb_a pestilence in the 430s bce , kb_apollo_program 's kb_temple_of_apollo_sosianus at kb_roman_empire was established in the flaminian fields , replacing an older kb_cult_(religious_practice) site there known as the `` apollinare '' . during the kb_second_punic_war kb_war in 212 bce , the `` kb_ludi_apollinares apollinares '' ( `` apollonian games '' ) were instituted in kb_histidine honor , on the instructions of kb_a kb_prophecy attributed to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) marcius . in the kb_time_(magazine) of kb_augustus , kb_world_health_organization considered himself under the special protection of kb_apollo_program and was even said to kb_beryllium kb_histidine son , kb_histidine kb_achilles#worship kb_adaptation and kb_he_(letter) became kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_tribal_chief kb_deity of kb_roman_empire .after the kb_battle_of_actium kb_actium , which was fought near kb_a sanctuary of kb_apollo_program , kb_augustus enlarged kb_apollo_program 's kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina , dedicated kb_a portion of the spoils to him , and instituted kb_quinquennial games in kb_histidine kb_honour . kb_he_(letter) also erected kb_temple_of_apollo_(palatine) kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina to the kb_god on the kb_palatine_hill kb_hill . sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to kb_apollo_program and kb_diana_(mythology) formed the culmination of the kb_secular_games , held in 17 bce to celebrate the dawn of kb_a kb_new_world era .the kb_tribal_chief apollonian festival was the kb_pythian_games games held every four years at kb_delphi and was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the four great kb_panhellenic_games games . also of kb_major_(united_states) importance was the kb_delia_(festival) held every four years on kb_delos .kb_athenian kb_annual_plant festivals included the kb_boedromia , kb_metageitnia , kb_pyanepsia , and kb_thargelia .spartan kb_annual_plant festivals were the kb_carneia and the kb_hyacinthia .kb_thebes_(greece) every nine years held the kb_daphnephoria .kb_apollo_program 's most common kb_attribute_(role-playing_games) were the kb_bow_river and kb_arrow_(weapon) . kb_other_(philosophy) kb_attribute_(role-playing_games) of kb_histidine included the kb_kithara ( an advanced version of the common kb_lyre ) , the kb_plectrum and the kb_sword . another common emblem was the kb_sacrificial_tripod tripod , representing kb_histidine prophetic powers . the kb_pythian_games games were held in kb_apollo_program 's honor every four years at kb_delphi . the kb_bay_laurel kb_bay_laurel kb_plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the kb_laurel_wreath of victorythe kb_palm_tree was also kb_sacred_architecture to kb_apollo_program because kb_he_(letter) had been born under kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) in kb_delos . kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing kb_sacred_architecture to kb_apollo_program included kb_gray_wolf , dolphins , kb_roe_deer kb_deer , swans , cicadas ( symbolizing kb_music and song ) , hawks , ravens , crows , kb_snakes ( referencing kb_apollo_program 's kb_function_(biology) as the kb_god of kb_prophecy ) , mice and griffinsas kb_god of colonization , kb_apollo_program gave kb_oracular guidance on kb_abraham_lincoln_on_slavery#colonization , especially during the height of colonization , 750–550 bce . according to kb_ancient_greek_astronomy , kb_he_(letter) helped kb_crete or arcadian kb_colonies_in_antiquity found kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_troy . however , this story may reflect kb_a kb_cultural_anthropology influence which had the kb_obverse_and_reverse direction : kb_hittites kb_cuneiform kb_literature mention kb_a minor kb_asian_people kb_god called `` appaliunas '' or `` apalunas '' in connection with kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_wilusa attested in kb_hittites kb_inscriptiones_graecae , which is now generally regarded as kb_being kb_identical_particles with the kb_ancient_greek kb_troy by most scholars . in this kb_interpretation_(logic) , kb_apollo_program 's kb_title of `` lykegenes '' can simply kb_beryllium kb_walter_read as `` born in kb_lycia '' , which effectively severs the kb_god 's supposed link with kb_gray_wolf ( possibly kb_a kb_folk_etymology ) .in literary contexts , kb_apollo_program represents kb_harmony , kb_order_(biology) , and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of kb_dionysus , kb_god of kb_wine , kb_world_health_organization represents ecstasy and disorder . the kb_contrast_(vision) between the roles of these kb_deity is reflected in the adjectives kb_apollonian_and_dionysian and dionysian . however , the kb_greeks thought of the kb_2_(number) qualities as complementary : the kb_2_(number) kb_deity are kb_monk , and when kb_apollo_program at kb_winter kb_left-wing_politics for kb_hyperborea , kb_he_(letter) would leave the kb_pythia kb_oracle to kb_dionysus . this kb_contrast_(vision) appears to kb_beryllium shown on the kb_2_(number) sides of the kb_borghese_vase vase .kb_apollo_program is often associated with the kb_golden_mean_(philosophy) . this is the kb_ancient_greek kb_ideal_(ring_theory) of kb_moderation and kb_a kb_virtue that opposes kb_gluttonykb_apollo_program is kb_a common kb_theme_(byzantine_district) in kb_ancient_greek and kb_roman_empire kb_art and also in the kb_art of the kb_renaissance . the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century kb_ancient_greek word for kb_a kb_statue is `` delight '' ( , `` agalma '' ) , and the sculptors tried to create kb_theory_of_forms which would inspire such guiding kb_computer_vision . kb_ancient_greek kb_art puts into kb_apollo_program the highest kb_degree_(angle) of kb_power_(physics) and kb_beauty that can kb_beryllium imagined . the sculptors kb_derived_trait this from kb_observations_(pierre_belon) on kb_human_kind , but they also kb_embodied_agent in kb_concrete kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , issues beyond the reach of kb_ordinary_(officer) thought .the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the kb_cult_(religious_practice) of the kb_human_body that was essentially kb_a kb_religion activity . the muscular frames and kb_limb_(anatomy) combined with slim waists indicate the kb_ancient_greek desire for health , and the kb_health capacity which was necessary in the hard kb_ancient_greek environment . the statues of kb_apollo_program embody kb_beauty , kb_formal_balance and inspire awe before the kb_beauty of the kb_world_war_ii .the kb_evolution of the kb_ancient_greek kb_sculpture can kb_beryllium observed in kb_histidine depictions from the almost static formal kb_kouros kb_type_(biology) in kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period , to the kb_representation_(arts) of kb_motion_(physics) in kb_a relative harmonious whole in kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period . in kb_classical_greece the kb_emphasis_(typography) is not given to the illusive kb_imagination kb_reality represented by the kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_theory_of_forms , but to the analogies and the kb_interaction of the members in the whole , kb_a method created by kb_polykleitos . finally kb_praxiteles seems to kb_beryllium released from any kb_art and kb_religion conformities , and kb_histidine masterpieces are kb_a kb_mixture of kb_realism_(arts) with stylization .the kb_evolution of the kb_ancient_greek kb_art seems to kb_go_(game) parallel with the kb_ancient_greek kb_philosophy conceptions , which changed from the natural-philosophy of kb_thales to the kb_metaphysics kb_theory of kb_pythagoras . kb_thales searched for kb_a kb_simple_polygon material-form directly perceptible by the senses , behind the appearances of things , and kb_histidine kb_theory is also related to the older kb_animism . this was paralleled in kb_sculpture by the kb_absolute_morality kb_representation_(arts) of vigorous kb_life_(magazine) , through unnaturally simplified kb_theory_of_forms .kb_pythagoras believed that behind the kb_appearance_(philosophy) of things , there was the permanent kb_principle_(chemistry) of kb_mathematics , and that the kb_theory_of_forms were based on kb_a kb_transcendental_number mathematical relation . the kb_theory_of_forms on kb_earth , are imperfect imitations ( , `` eikones '' , `` images '' ) of the celestial kb_world_war_ii of kb_grammatical_number . kb_histidine kb_idea had kb_a great influence on post-archaic kb_art . the kb_ancient_greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation , that would kb_lead to the esthetic perfection . ( kb_aesthetic_canon ) .in kb_classical_greece , kb_anaxagoras asserted that kb_a kb_divinity kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving ( kb_mind ) gave kb_order_(biology) to the seeds of the kb_universe , and kb_platokb_kouros ( `` kb_male youth '' ) is the kb_modern_history kb_terminology given to those representations of standing kb_male youths which kb_first_trimester appear in the kb_archaic_period_in_greece in kb_greece . this kb_type_(biology) served certain kb_religion needs and was kb_first_trimester kb_anatolian_hypothesis for what was previously thought to kb_beryllium depictions of `` kb_apollo_program '' . the kb_first_trimester statues are certainly still and formal . the formality of their stance seems to kb_beryllium related with the kb_egyptian_language kb_stare_decisis , but kb_it was kb_acceptance#self_acceptance for kb_a good kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving . the sculptors had kb_a clear idea of what kb_a kb_thomas_young_(scientist) man is , and kb_embodied_agent the archaic smile of good manners , the firm and springy step , the kb_formal_balance of the kb_human_body , dignity , and youthful kb_happiness . when they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men , kb_it was because men had common kb_semitic_root with the unchanging kb_deity . the adoption of kb_a standard recognizable kb_type_(biology) for kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_time_(magazine) , is probably because kb_nature gives preference in survival of kb_a kb_type_(biology) which has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_beryllium kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by the kb_climatic conditions , and also due to the kb_general_(united_states) kb_ancient_greek belief that kb_nature expresses itself in `` kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_theory_of_forms '' that can kb_beryllium imagined and represented . these kb_theory_of_forms expressed immortality . kb_apollo_program was the kb_immortality kb_god of `` kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_formal_balance and kb_order_(biology) '' . kb_histidine shrine in kb_delphiin the kb_first_trimester large-scale depictions during the kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period ( 640–580 bc ) , the artists tried to draw kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's attention to kb_look_(american_magazine) into the interior of the face and the kb_human_body which were not represented as lifeless masses , but as kb_being full of kb_life_(magazine) . the kb_greeks maintained , until late in their kb_civilization_(series) , an almost kb_animism idea that the statues are in some kb_word_sense alive . this embodies the belief that the image was somehow the kb_god or man himself . kb_a kb_fine_(penalty) example is the kb_statue of the `` kb_sacred_gate kb_kouros '' which was found at the cemetery of kb_dipylon in kb_athens ( kb_dipylon_kouros ) . the kb_statue is the `` kb_object_(philosophy) kb_thing-in-itself itself '' , and kb_histidine slender face with the deep eyes express an kb_intellectual kb_eternity . according to the kb_ancient_greek_astronomy the kb_dipylon was kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_daedalusthe kb_animism idea as the kb_representation_(arts) of the kb_imagination kb_reality , is sanctified in the kb_homeric poems and in kb_ancient_greek kb_egyptian_mythology , in stories of the kb_god kb_hephaestus ( kb_phaistos ) and the mythic kb_daedalus ( the builder of the kb_labyrinth ) that made images which moved of their own accord . this kind of kb_art goes back to the kb_minoan_civilization period , when its main kb_theme_(byzantine_district) was the kb_representation_(arts) of kb_motion_(physics) in kb_a specific moment . these free-standing statues were usually kb_marble , but also the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism rendered in kb_limestone , kb_bronze_age , kb_ivory and kb_terracotta .the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century examples of life-sized statues of kb_apollo_program , may kb_beryllium kb_2_(number) figures from the kb_ionic_crystal sanctuary on the kb_island of kb_delos . such statues were found across the kb_ancient_greek speaking kb_world_war_ii , the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of kb_apollo_program with more than kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hundred from the sanctuary of `` kb_apollo_program ptoios '' , kb_boeotia alone . the last stage in the development of the `` kb_kouros kb_type_(biology) '' is the kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period ( 520–485 bc ) , in which the kb_ancient_greek kb_sculpture attained kb_a full kb_knowledge_representation of kb_human_body and used to create kb_a relative harmonious whole . ranking from the very few bronzes survived to kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) is the masterpiece kb_bronze_age kb_piraeus_apollo . kb_it was found in kb_piraeus , the kb_harbour of kb_athens . the kb_statue originally held the kb_bow_river in its kb_left-wing_politics kb_hand , and kb_a cup of pouring libation in its kb_right-wing_politics kb_hand . kb_it probably comes from north-eastern kb_peloponnesus . the kb_emphasis_(typography) is given in kb_comparative_anatomy , and kb_it is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester attempts to represent kb_a kind of kb_motion_(physics) , and kb_beauty relative to proportions , which appear mostly in post-archaic kb_art . the kb_statue kb_throw_(grappling) some kb_light on an artistic centre which , with an independently kb_adaptation harder , simpler and heavier kb_carpel , restricts kb_ionian_greeks influence in kb_athens . finally , this is the germ from which the kb_art of kb_polykleitosat kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the kb_classical_greece , kb_it was considered that kb_beauty in visible things as in everything else , consisted of kb_symmetry and proportions . the artists tried also to represent kb_motion_(physics) in kb_a specific moment ( kb_myron ) , which may kb_beryllium considered as the reappearance of the dormant kb_minoan_civilization kb_chemical_element . kb_comparative_anatomy and kb_geometry are fused in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) , and each does something to the kb_other_(philosophy) . the kb_ancient_greek sculptors tried to clarify kb_it by looking for mathematical proportions , just as they sought some kb_reality behind appearances . kb_polykleitos in kb_histidine `` kb_aesthetic_canon '' wrote that kb_beauty consists in the kb_hierarchical_proportion not of the kb_chemical_element ( materials ) , but of the parts , that is the interrelation of parts with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) another and with the whole . kb_it seems that kb_he_(letter) was influenced by the kb_theories of kb_pythagoras .the famous `` kb_apollo_program of kb_mantua '' and its variants are early kb_theory_of_forms of the kb_apollo_citharoedus kb_statue kb_type_(biology) , in which the kb_god holds the kb_cithara in kb_histidine kb_left-wing_politics kb_arm . the kb_type_(biology) is represented by kb_neo-attic kb_ottoman_empire kb_roman_empire copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century , modelled upon kb_a supposed kb_ancient_greek kb_bronze_age original made in the kb_second_language quarter of the 5th century bce , in kb_a kb_carpel similar to works of kb_polykleitos but more archaic . the kb_apollo_program held the `` cythara '' against kb_histidine extended kb_left-wing_politics kb_arm , of which in the louvre example , kb_a fragment of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) twisting scrolling kb_french_horn upright remains against kb_histidine biceps .though the proportions were always important in kb_ancient_greek kb_art , the kb_appeal of the kb_ancient_greek sculptures eludes any explanation by kb_hierarchical_proportion alone . the statues of kb_apollo_program were thought to kb_incarnation kb_histidine living presence , and these representations of illusive kb_imagination kb_reality had deep kb_semitic_root in the kb_minoan_civilization period , and in the kb_orthodoxy of the kb_first_trimester kb_ancient_greekin the archaic pediments and friezes of the kb_egyptian_temple , the artists had kb_a problem to fit kb_a kb_group_(periodic_table) of figures into an isosceles kb_triangle_(musical_instrument) with acute angles at the kb_base_(chemistry) .the kb_siphnian_treasury treasury in kb_delphi was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester kb_ancient_greek kb_buildings utilizing the kb_solid_solution to put the dominating kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism in the middle , and to complete the descending scale of height with kb_other_(philosophy) figures sitting or kneeling . the pediment shows the story of kb_heracles stealing kb_apollo_program 's tripod that was strongly associated with kb_histidine kb_oracular inspiration . their kb_2_(number) figures hold the centre . in the pediment of the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina of kb_zeus in kb_olympia_(manet)these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the kb_human_eye for their own visible sake . they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in kb_space , but only as parts in kb_a larger whole . while each scene has its own kb_character_(computing) and completeness kb_it must fit into the kb_general_(united_states) sequence to which kb_it belongs . in these archaic pediments the sculptors use kb_empty_string intervals , to suggest kb_a passage to and from kb_a busy battlefield . the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical kb_pattern and kb_order_(biology) , and this was improved when kb_classical_conditioning kb_art brought kb_a greater kb_freedom and kb_economy_of_alaska .kb_apollo_program as kb_a handsome beardless kb_thomas_young_(scientist) man , is often depicted with kb_a kb_kithara ( as kb_apollo_citharoedus ) or kb_bow_river in kb_histidine kb_hand , or reclining on kb_a kb_tree ( the kb_apollo_lykeios and kb_apollo_sauroctonos types ) . the kb_apollo_belvedere is kb_a kb_marble kb_sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century ; for kb_century_(cricket) kb_it epitomized the ideals of kb_classical_antiquity for europeans , from the kb_renaissance through the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century . the kb_marble is kb_a kb_hellenistic_period or kb_roman_empire copy of kb_a kb_bronze_age original by the kb_ancient_greek kb_sculptor_(constellation) kb_leochares , made between 350 and 325 bce .the life-size so-called `` kb_adonis '' found in 1780 on the site of kb_a `` kb_roman_villa '' near the via labicana in the kb_roman_empire suburb of centocelle is kb_interpretatio_graeca as an kb_apollo_program by kb_modern_history scholars . in the late 2nd century kb_council_of_europe floor kb_mosaic from kb_el_djem , kb_roman_empire `` thysdrus '' , kb_he_(letter) is identifiable as kb_helios by kb_histidine effulgent kb_halo_(religious_iconography) , though now even kb_a kb_god 's kb_divinity kb_nudity is concealed by kb_histidine cloak , kb_a kb_mark_waugh of increasing conventions of modesty in the later kb_roman_empire .another haloed kb_apollo_program in kb_mosaic , from kb_hadrumentum , is in the kb_museum at kb_sousse . the conventions of this kb_representation_(arts) , kb_human_head tilted , lips slightly parted , large-eyed , curling kb_hairstyle cut in locks kb_grazing the kb_neck , were kb_adaptation in the 3rd century bce to depict kb_alexander_the_great great . some kb_time_(magazine) after this kb_mosaic was kb_execution_(computing) , the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century depictions of kb_jesus_christ would also kb_beryllium beardless and haloed .kb_apollo_program has often featured in postclassical kb_art and kb_ancient_egyptian_literature . kb_percy_bysshe_shelley bysshe shelley composed kb_a `` hymn of kb_apollo_program '' ( 1820 ) , and the kb_god 's instruction of the kb_muses formed the kb_grammatical_subject of kb_igor_stravinsky stravinsky 's `` kb_apollon_musagète '' ( 1927–1928 ) . in 1978 , the kb_canadians band kb_rush_(band) released kb_hemispheres_(rush_album) kb_purple_rain_(album) with songs `` kb_apollo_program : bringer of wisdom '' / '' kb_dionysus : bringer of kb_love '' .in discussion of kb_the_arts kb_arts , kb_a distinction is sometimes made between the kb_apollonian_and_dionysian and dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing kb_intellectual kb_order_(biology) and the latter with chaotic creativity . kb_friedrich_nietzsche nietzsche argued that kb_a fusion of the kb_2_(number) was most desirable . kb_carl_jung jung 's kb_apollo_archetype represents what kb_he_(letter) saw as the disposition in kb_people_(american_magazine) to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional kb_distance .kb_charles_handy handy , in `` kb_deity of kb_management '' ( 1978 ) uses kb_ancient_greek kb_deity as kb_a metaphor to portray various types of kb_organizational_culture kb_albanian_culture . kb_apollo_program represents kb_a 'role ' kb_albanian_culture where kb_order_(biology) ,

( approximately where kb_modern_history kb_laos , kb_thailand , and kb_cambodia come together ) , and that the kb_family_(biology) is not as kb_old_testament as frequently assumed , dating to perhaps 2000 bce . peiros ( 2011 ) criticized sidwell 's kb_theory heavily and calls kb_it kb_a bunch of contradictions . kb_he_(letter) show with kb_histidine kb_analysis that the kb_urheimat of

kb_central_europe and kb_south_china and than into kb_southeast_asia . kb_he_(letter) further suggests that the kb_family_(biology) must kb_beryllium as kb_old_testament as proto-austronesian and proto-sinotibetan or even older .georg van driem ( 2011 ) proposes that the kb_urheimat of austroasiatic is somewhere in kb_south_china . kb_he_(letter) suggests that the kb_region around the kb_pearl_river_(china) kb_river ( kb_china ) is the likely kb_urheimat of the kb_austroasiatic_languages languages and kb_people_(american_magazine) . kb_he_(letter) further suggests , based on kb_heredity studies , that the migration of kb_kra–dai_languages kb_people_(american_magazine) from kb_taiwan replaced the original austroasiatic kb_hunnic_language but the effect on the

kb_other_(philosophy) kb_primary_education kb_branches_of_science of austroasiatic that are now kb_extinct , based on kb_substratum kb_evidence_(law) in modern-day languages .kb_other_(philosophy)

kb_indo-gangetic_plain plain , and were then absorbed by kb_indo-aryan_languages at an early date as kb_indo-aryan_languages kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) kb_east_africa . peterson notes that kb_eastern_hemisphere kb_indo-aryan_languageskb_paul_sidwell ( kb_2009_in_science ) , in kb_a kb_lexicostatistical comparison of 36 languages which are kb_water_well known enough to exclude loan kb_lexical_semantics , finds little kb_evidence_(law) for internal branching , though kb_he_(letter) did find an kb_area of increased contact between the kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages , such that languages of all kb_branches_of_science apart from the kb_geography_of_albania distant kb_munda_languages and kb_nicobarese_languages show greater similarity to kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages the closer they are to those kb_branches_of_science , without any noticeable innovations common to kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages .kb_he_(letter) therefore takes the kb_conservative view that the thirteen kb_branches_of_science of austroasiatic should kb_beryllium treated as equidistant on kb_electric_current kb_evidence_(law) . sidwell & kb_roger_blench ( 2011 ) discuss this proposal in more detail , and note that there is good kb_evidence_(law) for kb_a khasi–palaungic kb_cladistics , which could also possibly kb_beryllium closely related to khmuic .if this would the case , sidwell & kb_roger_blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) westward . sidwell & kb_roger_blench ( 2011 ) suggest kb_shompen_language as an additional branch , and kb_believe_(tv_series) that kb_a vieto-katuic connection is worth investigating . in kb_general_(united_states) , however , the kb_family_(biology) is thought to have diversified too quickly for kb_a deeply nested kb_structure to have kb_adaptation , since proto-austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the kb_central_europe kb_mekong_river kb_valley relatively quickly .subsequently , sidwell ( 2015a : 179 ) kb_anatolian_hypothesis that kb_nicobarese_languages subgroups with kb_aslian_languages , just as how khasian and palaungic subgroup with each kb_other_(philosophy) . kb_a subsequent computational kb_phylogenetics kb_analysis of the austroasiatic kb_language_family by sidwell ( 2015b ) suggests that austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science may have kb_a loosely nested kb_structure rather than kb_a completely rake-like kb_structure , with an east-west kb_division_(mathematics) ( consisting of kb_munda_languages , khasic , palaungic , and khmuic forming kb_a kb_western_esotericism kb_group_(periodic_table) as opposed to all of the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_branches_of_science ) occurring possibly as early as 7,000 years before present .integrating computational kb_phylogenetics kb_linguistics with recent kb_archaeology findings , kb_paul_sidwell ( 2015c ) further expanded kb_histidine kb_mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into kb_indochina from the kb_lingnan kb_area of kb_south_china , with the subsequent kb_mekong riverine dispersal taking kb_place_of_articulation after the initial kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_neolithic farmers from kb_south_china .sidwell ( 2015c ) tentatively suggests that austroasiatic may have begun to split up 5,000 years b.p . during the kb_neolithic_transition era of kb_mainland_southeast_asia kb_southeast_asia , with all the kb_major_(united_states) kb_branches_of_science of austroasiatic formed by 4,000 b.p . austroasiatic would have had kb_2_(number) possible dispersal routes from the kb_western_esotericism kb_peripheral_nervous_system of the kb_pearl_river_(china) kb_river kb_drainage_divide of kb_lingnan , which would have been either kb_a kb_coastal route down the kb_coast of kb_vietnam , or downstream through the kb_mekong_river via kb_yunnan . both the reconstructed kb_lexicon of proto-austroasiatic and the kb_archaeology record clearly show that early austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers around 4,000 b.p . cultivated kb_rice and kb_millet , kept kb_livestock such as dogs , pigs , and kb_chickens , and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than kb_coastal environments .at 4,500 b.p. , this `` kb_neolithic package '' suddenly arrived in kb_indochina from the kb_lingnan kb_area without kb_cereal kb_cereal and displaced the kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet pre-neolithic kb_hunter-gatherer cultures , with kb_cereal husks found in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_indochina by 4,100 b.p . and in kb_southern_europe kb_indochina by 3,800 b.p . however , sidwell ( 2015c ) found that kb_iron is not reconstructable in proto-austroasiatic , since each austroasiatic branch has different terms for kb_iron that had been kb_loanword relatively lately from tai , kb_chinese_characters , tibetan , kb_malay_language , and kb_other_(philosophy) languages .during the kb_iron_age about 2,500 b.p. , relatively kb_thomas_young_(scientist) austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science in kb_indochina such as kb_vietic_languages , kb_katuic_languages , kb_pearic_languages , and kb_khmer_alphabet were formed , while the more internally diverse kb_bahnaric_languages branch ( dating to about 3,000 b.p . ) underwent more extensive internal diversification . by the kb_iron_age , all of the austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science were more or less in their present-day locations , with most of the diversification within austroasiatic taking kb_place_of_articulation during the kb_iron_age .kb_paul_sidwell ( 2018 ) considers the austroasiatic kb_language_family to have rapidly diversified around 4,000 years b.p . during the kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_rice kb_agriculture in kb_indochina , but notes that the kb_evolution of proto-austroasiatic itself is older than that date . the kb_lexicon of proto-austroasiatic can kb_beryllium divided into an early and late stratum . the early stratum consists of kb_base_(chemistry) kb_lexicon including kb_human_body parts , kb_animal names , kb_natural_number features , and pronouns , while the names of kb_cultural_anthropology items ( kb_agriculture terms and kb_lexical_semantics for kb_cultural_anthropology kb_artifact_(archaeology) , which are reconstructable in proto-austroasiatic ) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism part of the later stratum .kb_roger_blench kb_roger_blench ( 2017 ) suggests that vocabulary related to kb_aquatic_plant subsistence strategies ( such as boats , waterways , kb_river kb_fauna , and kb_fish capture techniques ) , can kb_beryllium reconstructed for proto-austroasiatic . kb_roger_blench ( 2017 ) finds widespread austroasiatic kb_semitic_root for 'river , kb_valley ' , 'boat ' , 'fish ' , 'catfish sp . ' , 'eel ' , 'prawn ' , 'shrimp ' ( kb_central_europe austroasiatic ) , 'crab ' , 'tortoise ' , 'turtle ' , 'otter ' , 'crocodile ' , 'heron , kb_fishing kb_bird ' , and 'fish trap ' . kb_archaeology kb_evidence_(law) for the presence of kb_agriculture in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_indochina ( kb_northern_hemisphere kb_vietnam , kb_laos , and kb_other_(philosophy) nearby areas ) dates back to only about 4,000 years b.p . ( 2,000 b.c . ) , with kb_agriculture ultimately kb_being introduced from further up to the kb_north in the kb_yangtze kb_valley where kb_it has been dated to 6,000 b.p .hence , this points to kb_a relatively late riverine dispersal of austroasiatic as compared to kb_sino-tibetan_languages , whose kb_appledesign_powered_speakers had kb_a distinct non-riverine kb_albanian_culture . in kb_addition to living an aquatic-based kb_lifestyle_(sociology) , early austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers would have also had access to kb_livestock , crops , and newer types of watercraft . as early austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways , they would have encountered kb_appledesign_powered_speakers of older kb_language_family kb_world_health_organization were already kb_second_greek_colonisation in the kb_area , such as kb_sino-tibetan_languages .kb_other_(philosophy) than latin-based alphabets , many kb_austroasiatic_languages languages are written with the kb_khmer_alphabet , kb_thai_alphabet , kb_lao_alphabet , and kb_burmese_alphabet alphabets . kb_vietnamese_australian divergently had an kb_indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas script based on kb_chinese_characters logographic writing . this has since been supplanted by the kb_latin_alphabet in the 20th century . the following are examples of past-used alphabets or kb_electric_current alphabets of kb_austroasiatic_languages languages .according to chaubey et al. , `` austro-asiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers in kb_indian_subcontinent today are kb_derived_trait from dispersal from kb_southeast_asia , followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local kb_indian_people populations . '' according to riccio et al. , the kb_munda_languages kb_people_(american_magazine) are likely descended from austroasiatic migrants from kb_southeast_asia .according to zhang et al. , austroasiatic migrations from kb_southeast_asia into kb_indian_subcontinent took kb_place_of_articulation after the kb_last_glacial_maximum glacial maximum , circa 10,000 years ago . arunkumar et kb_aluminium .

the kb_toponymy `` hamito-semitic '' for the entire kb_family_(biology) in kb_histidine `` grundriss der sprachwissenschaft '' ( 1876 ) . kb_maurice_delafosse delafosse ( 1914 ) later kb_neologism the kb_terminology `` kb_afroasiatic_languages '' ( often now spelled `` kb_afro-asiatic_languages '' ) . however , kb_it did not come into kb_general_(united_states) use until kb_joseph_greenberg greenberg ( 1950 ) formally kb_anatolian_hypothesis its adoption . in doing kb_sulfate , greenberg sought to emphasize the kb_fact that kb_afroasiatic_languages spanned the kb_the_americas of both kb_africa and kb_asia_(roman_province) .kb_individual scholars have also called the kb_family_(biology) `` erythraean '' ( tucker 1966 ) and `` lisramic '' ( hodge kb_1972_wimbledon_championships ) . in lieu of `` hamito-semitic '' , the kb_russian_alphabet linguist kb_igor_diakonoff diakonoffscholars generally treat the kb_afroasiatic_languages kb_language_family as including the following kb_branches_of_science :although there is kb_general_(united_states) kb_agreement_(linguistics) on these six kb_family_(biology) , kb_linguistics kb_world_health_organization kb_science kb_afroasiatic_languages raise some points of disagreement , in kb_particular :in the 9th century , the kb_hebrew_alphabet grammarian kb_judah_ibn_kuraish ibn kb_quraysh of kb_tiaret in kb_algeria was the kb_first_trimester to link kb_2_(number) kb_branches_of_science of kb_afroasiatic_languages together ; kb_he_(letter) perceived kb_a relationship between kb_berber_languages and kb_semitic_languages . kb_he_(letter) knew of kb_semitic_languages through kb_histidine kb_science of kb_arabic_alphabet , kb_hebrew_alphabet , and kb_aramaic_alphabet .in the course of the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century , europeans also began suggesting such relationships . in 1844 , kb_theodor_benfey benfey suggested kb_a kb_language_family consisting of kb_semitic_languages , kb_berber_languages , and kb_cushitic_languages ( calling the latter `` kb_ge'ez_language '' ) . in the same year , t.n . newman suggested kb_a relationship between kb_semitic_languages and kb_hausa_people , but this would kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) remain kb_a kb_topic_(linguistics) of kb_cleveland_browns_relocation_controversy and kb_uncertainty .kb_friedrich_müller_(linguist) müller kb_english_alphabet#letter_names the traditional hamito-semitic kb_family_(biology) in 1876 in kb_histidine `` grundriss der sprachwissenschaft '' ( `` outline

kb_egyptian_language , kb_berber_languages , and kb_cushitic_languages ; kb_he_(letter) excluded the kb_chadic_languages kb_group_(periodic_table) . kb_it was the kb_egyptology kb_karl_richard_lepsius richard lepsius ( 1810–1884 ) kb_world_health_organization restricted hamitic to the non-semitic languages in kb_africa , which are characterized by kb_a kb_grammatical_gender kb_grammatical_gender system . this `` hamitic kb_hunnic_language kb_group_(periodic_table) '' was kb_anatolian_hypothesis to unite various , mainly north-african , languages , including the kb_ancient_egyptian_medicine kb_hunnic_language , the kb_berber_languages , the kb_cushitic_languages , the kb_beja_language kb_hunnic_language , and the kb_chadic_languages . unlike müller , lepsius considered that kb_hausa_people and kb_nama_languagein 1912 , kb_carl_meinhof meinhof published `` die sprachen der hamiten '' ( `` the languages of the hamites '' ) , in which kb_he_(letter) expanded lepsius 's kb_rutherford_model , adding the kb_fula_language , kb_maasai_language , kb_bari_language , kb_nandi_languages , kb_sandawe_language and kb_hadza_people languages to the hamitic kb_group_(periodic_table) . meinhof 's kb_rutherford_model was widely kb_catalyst_support into the kb_1940s . meinhof 's system of kb_statistical_classification of the hamitic languages was based on kb_a belief that `` kb_appledesign_powered_speakers of hamitic became largely coterminous with kb_cattle herding kb_people's_party_of_armenia with essentially caucasian origins , intrinsically different from and superior to the 'negroes of kb_africa ' . '' however , in the case of the so-called kb_nilo-hamitic_languages languages ( kb_a kb_concept kb_he_(letter) introduced ) , kb_it was based on the kb_linguistic_typology kb_i_shot_andy_warhol of gender and kb_a `` fallacious kb_theory of kb_mixed_language . '' meinhof did this although kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet kb_cold_working by scholars such as lepsius and johnston had substantiated that the languages which kb_he_(letter) would later dub `` nilo-hamitic '' were in kb_fact nilotic languages , with numerous similarities in vocabulary to kb_other_(philosophy) nilotic languages .kb_leo_reinisch reinisch ( 1909 ) had already kb_anatolian_hypothesis linking kb_cushitic_languages and kb_chadic_languages , while urging their more distant affinity with kb_egyptian_language and kb_semitic_languages . however , kb_histidine suggestion found little acceptance . kb_marcel_cohen kb_paul_cohen ( 1924 ) rejected the idea of kb_a distinct `` hamitic '' subgroup , and included kb_hausa_people ( kb_a kb_chadic_languages kb_hunnic_language ) in kb_histidine comparative hamito-semitic vocabulary . finally , kb_joseph_greenberg greenberg 's 1950 kb_cold_working kb_light-emitting_diode to the widespread rejection of `` hamitic '' as kb_a kb_hunnic_language category by kb_linguistics . greenberg refuted meinhof 's kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_theories , and rejected the use of kb_race_(classification_of_human_beings) and kb_social_anarchism kb_evidence_(law) . in dismissing the notion of kb_a separate `` nilo-hamitic '' kb_hunnic_language category in kb_particular , greenberg was `` returning to kb_a view widely held kb_a half century kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet . '' kb_he_(letter) consequently rejoined meinhof 's so-called kb_nilo-hamitic_languages languages with their appropriate nilotic siblings . kb_he_(letter) also added ( and sub-classified ) the kb_chadic_languages , and kb_anatolian_hypothesis the kb_new_world kb_toponymy kb_afroasiatic_languages for the kb_family_(biology) . kb_almost_all all scholars have kb_acceptance#self_acceptance this kb_statistical_classification as the kb_new_world and continued consensus .greenberg 's kb_rutherford_model was fully kb_adaptation in kb_histidine book `` kb_the_languages_of_africa languages of kb_africa '' ( 1963 ) , in which kb_he_(letter) reassigned most of meinhof 's additions to hamitic to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_language_family , notably kb_nilo-saharan . following kb_isaac_schapera schapera and rejecting meinhof , kb_he_(letter) classified the kb_hottentot_language kb_hunnic_language as kb_a member of the kb_khoisan_languages languages , kb_a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of kb_click_consonant sounds . to khoisan kb_he_(letter) also added the tanzanian kb_hadza_people and kb_sandawe_language , though this view has been discredited as kb_linguistics working on these languages consider them to kb_beryllium kb_language_isolate . despite this , greenberg 's kb_statistical_classification remains kb_a starting point for kb_modern_history kb_cold_working of many languages spoken in kb_africa , and the hamitic category ( and its kb_extension_(kinesiology) to nilo-hamitic ) has no part in this .since the kb_triliteral traditional kb_branches_of_science of the hamitic languages ( kb_berber_languages , kb_cushitic_languages and kb_egyptian_language ) have not been shown to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism an exclusive ( kb_monophyly ) kb_phylogenetics kb_units_of_measurement of their own , separate from kb_other_(philosophy) kb_afroasiatic_languages languages , kb_linguistics no longer use the kb_terminology in this kb_word_sense . each of these kb_branches_of_science is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger kb_afroasiatic_languages kb_family_(biology) .in 1969 , kb_harold_c._fleming fleming kb_anatolian_hypothesis that what had previously been known as kb_western_esotericism kb_cushitic_languages is an independent branch of kb_afroasiatic_languages , suggesting for kb_it the kb_new_world kb_toponymy kb_omotic_languages . this proposal and kb_toponymy have kb_methionine with widespread acceptance .several scholars , including kb_harold_c._fleming fleming and kb_robert_hetzron hetzron , have since questioned the traditional inclusion of beja in kb_cushitic_languages .`` kb_glottolog '' does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of kb_omotic_languages has been established , nor that of kb_ongota_language or the unclassified kb_kujarge_language . kb_it therefore splits off the following kb_group_(mathematics) as small kb_family_(biology) : kb_south_omotic_languages , kb_mao_languages , kb_dizoid_languages , kb_gonga–gimojan_languages ( kb_north kb_omotic_languages apart from the

kb_afroasiatic_languages : kb_semitic_languages , kb_egyptian_language , kb_berber_languages , kb_chadic_languages , kb_cushitic_languages , and kb_omotic_languages . however , kb_christopher_ehret ehret ( 1979 ) , kb_harold_c._fleming fleming ( 1981 ) , and kb_joseph_greenberg greenberg ( 1981 ) all agree that the kb_omotic_languages branch split from the rest kb_first_trimester .otherwise

kb_grammatical_number divided by the count of kb_grammatical_number in the kb_class_(set_theory) . the kb_class_(set_theory) is often kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of results of an kb_experiment or an kb_observational_study , or frequently kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of results from kb_a kb_survey_(statistics) . the kb_terminology `` kb_arithmetic kb_mean '' is preferred in some contexts in kb_mathematics and kb_statistics because kb_it helps distinguish kb_it from kb_other_(philosophy) means , such as the kb_geometric_mean and the kb_harmonic_mean .in kb_addition to kb_mathematics and kb_statistics , the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is used frequently in many diverse fields such as kb_economics , kb_anthropological_linguistics , and kb_history , and kb_it is used in almost every academic field to some extent . for example , kb_per_capita_income kb_income is the kb_arithmetic average kb_income of kb_a nation 's kb_population .while the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is often used to report kb_central_tendency , kb_it is not kb_a kb_robust_statistic statistic , kb_meaning_(linguistics) that kb_it is greatly influenced by outliers ( values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values ) . notably , for skewed distributions , such as the kb_distribution_of_income of kb_income for which kb_a few kb_people_(american_magazine) 's incomes are substantially greater than most kb_people_(american_magazine) 's , the kb_arithmetic kb_mean may not coincide with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's notion of `` middle '' , and robust kb_statistics , such as the kb_medes , may kb_beryllium kb_a better description of kb_central_europe tendency .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean ( or kb_mean or average ) , formula_1 ( kb_walter_read formula_2 `` bar '' ) , is the kb_mean of the formula_3 values formula_4 .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is the most commonly used and readily understood kb_measure_(mathematics) of kb_central_europe tendency in kb_a kb_data_set . in kb_statistics , the kb_terminology average refers to any of the measures of kb_central_europe tendency . the kb_arithmetic kb_mean of kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of observed kb_big_data is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as kb_being equal to the kb_addition of the numerical values of each and every kb_observation divided by the total kb_grammatical_number of kb_observations_(pierre_belon) . symbolically , if we have kb_a kb_data_set consisting of the values formula_5 , then the kb_arithmetic kb_mean formula_6 is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity by the kb_chemical_formula :( kb_episcopal_see kb_summation for an explanation of the kb_summation_operator ) .for example , let kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of kb_a firm : 2500 , 2700 , 2400 , 2300 , 2550 , 2650 , 2750 , 2450 , 2600 , 2400. the kb_arithmetic kb_mean isif the kb_data_set is kb_a kb_statistical_population ( i.e. , consists of every possible kb_observation and not just kb_a subset of them ) , then the kb_mean of that kb_population is called the kb_population kb_mean . if the kb_data_set is kb_a kb_sampling_(statistics) ( kb_a subset of the kb_population ) , we call the statistic resulting from this kb_calculation kb_a kb_sample_(statistics) kb_mean .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean has several kb_chemical_property that make kb_it useful , especially as kb_a kb_measure_(mathematics) of kb_central_europe tendency . these include :the kb_arithmetic kb_mean may kb_beryllium contrasted with the kb_medes . the kb_medes is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity such that no more than half the values are larger than , and no more than half are smaller than , the kb_medes . if kb_chemical_element in the kb_big_data kb_arithmetic_progression arithmeticallyif kb_a numerical kb_property , and any kb_sample_(statistics) of kb_big_data from kb_it , could kb_take on any kb_lightness from kb_a kb_continuous_function range , instead of , for example , just integers , then the kb_probability of kb_a kb_grammatical_number falling into some range of possible values can kb_beryllium described by integrating kb_a kb_continuous_probability_distribution distribution across this range , even when the naive kb_probability for kb_a kb_sample_(statistics) kb_grammatical_number taking kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) certain kb_lightness from infinitely many is kb_0_(number) . the kb_analog_device of kb_a kb_weighted_average average in this kb_context_(language_use) , in which there are an kb_infinite_set kb_grammatical_number of possibilities for the precise kb_lightness of the variable in each range , is called the `` kb_mean of the kb_probability_distribution '' . kb_a most widely encountered kb_probability_distribution is called the kb_normal_distribution distribution ; kb_it has the kb_property that all measures of its kb_central_europe tendency , including not just the kb_mean but also the aforementioned kb_medes and the kb_musical_mode ( the kb_triliteral kb_mole_(unit) 's ) , are equal to each kb_other_(philosophy) . this equality does not hold for kb_other_(philosophy) kb_probability distributions , as illustrated for the kb_lognormal_distribution distribution here .kb_particular care must kb_beryllium taken when using cyclic kb_big_data , such as kb_phase_(waves) or angles . naïvely taking the kb_arithmetic kb_mean of 1° and 359° yields kb_a result of

artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range . kb_a kb_solid_solution to this problem is to use the kb_optimization_theory formulation ( kb_viz. , define the kb_mean as the kb_central_europe point : the point about which kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) has the lowest kb_dispersion_(optics) ) , and redefine the difference as kb_a modular kb_distance ( i.e. , the kb_distance on the kb_circle : kb_sulfate the modular kb_distance between 1° and 359° is 2° , not 358° ) .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is often denoted by kb_a bar , for example as in formula_1 ( kb_walter_read formula_2 `` bar '' ) .some software ( kb_text_processing processors , kb_world_wide_web browsers ) may not kb_computer_monitor the x̄ kb_symbol properly . for example , the x̄

kb_joseph_stalin and hostile to moscow-directed kb_stalinism , an kb_orientation_(geometry) that was critically shaped by kb_histidine experiences during the kb_spanish_civil_war kb_war . the kb_soviet_union , kb_he_(letter) believed , had become kb_a brutal kb_dictatorship , built upon kb_a kb_cult_of_personality kb_personality and enforced by kb_great_purge of terror . in kb_einstein–szilárd_letter to yvonne davet , orwell described `` kb_animal_farm_(1954_film) '' as kb_a kb_satire tale against kb_joseph_stalin ( `` '' '' '' ) , and in kb_histidine essay `` kb_why_i_write kb_iodine write '' ( 1946 ) , wrote that `` kb_animal_farm_(1954_film) '' was the kb_first_trimester book in which kb_he_(letter) tried , with full consciousness of what kb_he_(letter)

kb_united_states_navy publishers dropped the subtitle when kb_it was published in 1946 , and only kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the translations during orwell 's lifetime kept kb_it . kb_other_(philosophy) titular variations include subtitles like `` kb_a kb_satire '' and `` kb_a contemporary kb_satire '' . orwell suggested the kb_title ' for the kb_france

kb_soviet_union against kb_nazi_germany and the kb_kingdom_of_great_britain kb_people_(american_magazine) and intelligentsia held kb_joseph_stalin in kb_high_middle_ages esteem , kb_a phenomenon

kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of orwell 's own , kb_victor_gollancz kb_victor_gollancz_ltd , which delayed its publication . kb_it became kb_a great commercial success when kb_it did appear partly

kb_tetrapod vertebrates of the kb_class_(biology) amphibia . kb_modern_history amphibians are all kb_lissamphibia . they inhabit kb_a wide kb_variety_(magazine) of habitats , with most kb_species living within kb_terrestrial_animal , kb_fossorial , kb_arboreal or kb_freshwater kb_aquatic_ecosystems . thus amphibians typically start out as kb_larvae living in kb_water , but some kb_species have kb_adaptation behavioural adaptations to bypass this . the kb_thomas_young_(scientist) generally undergo kb_metamorphosis from kb_larva with gills to an adult air-breathing kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism with kb_artificial_lung . amphibians use their kb_skin as kb_a kb_secondary_school kb_respiration_(physiology) kb_surface_(topology) and some small kb_terrestrial_animal salamanders and frogs lack kb_artificial_lung and rely entirely on their kb_skin . they are superficially similar to kb_lizards but , along with mammals and kb_birds , reptiles are amniotes and do not require kb_water bodies in which to kb_breed . with their kb_complex_number reproductive needs and permeable kb_seed_coat , amphibians are often ecological indicators ; in recent decades there has been kb_a dramatic kb_decline_in_amphibian_populations in kb_amphibian populations for many kb_species around kb_the_globe_(toronto_newspaper) globe .the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century amphibians kb_evolution_of_tetrapods in the kb_devonian period from kb_sarcopterygian kb_fish with kb_artificial_lung and bony-limbed kb_fish_fin , features that were helpful in adapting to dry kb_albanian_land_force . they diversified and became kb_dominant_allele during the kb_carboniferous and kb_permian periods , but were later displaced by reptiles and kb_other_(philosophy) vertebrates . over kb_time_(magazine) , amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity , leaving only the kb_modern_history subclass kb_lissamphibia .the kb_triliteral kb_modern_history kb_order_(biology) of amphibians are kb_anura_(frog) ( the frogs and toads ) , kb_urodela ( the salamanders ) , and kb_caecilian ( the caecilians ) . the kb_grammatical_number of known kb_amphibian kb_species is approximately 7,000 , of which nearly 90 % are frogs . the smallest kb_amphibian ( and kb_vertebrate ) in the kb_world_war_ii is kb_a kb_frog from kb_new_guinea ( `` kb_paedophryne_amauensis amauensis '' ) with kb_a kb_length of just . the kb_largest_organisms living kb_amphibian is the kb_chinese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias davidianus '' ) , but this is dwarfed by the kb_extinct `` kb_prionosuchus '' from the middle kb_permian of kb_brazil . the kb_science of amphibians is called kb_batrachology , while the kb_science of both reptiles and amphibians is called kb_herpetologykb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_amphibian '' is kb_derived_trait from the kb_ancient_greek kb_terminology ἀμφίβιος ( `` amphíbios '' ) , which means `` both kinds of kb_life_(magazine) '' , `` ἀμφί '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` of both kinds '' and `` βιος '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_life_(magazine) '' . the kb_terminology was initially used as kb_a kb_general_(united_states) kb_adjective for kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing that could live on kb_albanian_land_force or in kb_water , including kb_pinniped and otters . traditionally , the kb_class_(biology) amphibia includes all kb_tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes . amphibia in its widest kb_word_sense ( `` kb_sensu_lato '' ) was divided into kb_triliteral kb_class_(biology)the actual kb_grammatical_number of kb_species in each kb_group_(periodic_table) depends on the kb_taxonomy_(general) kb_statistical_classification followed . the kb_2_(number) most common kb_systems_analysis are the kb_statistical_classification kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by the website amphibiaweb , kb_university_of_california kb_california , kb_george_berkeley and the kb_statistical_classification by kb_herpetology kb_darrel_frost frost and the kb_american_museum_of_natural_history of kb_natural_number kb_history , kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance as the online reference database `` kb_amphibian kb_species of the kb_world_war_ii '' . the kb_grammatical_number of kb_species cited above follows frost and the total kb_grammatical_number of known kb_amphibian kb_species is over 7,000 , of which nearly 90 % are frogs .with the kb_phylogenetics kb_statistical_classification , the taxon kb_labyrinthodontia has been discarded as kb_it is kb_a kb_paraphyly kb_group_(periodic_table) without unique kb_definable_set features apart from kb_cladistics#plesiomorphy kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) characteristics . kb_statistical_classification varies according to the preferred kb_phylogeny of the author and whether they use kb_a kb_cladistics#three_definitions_of_clade or kb_a node-based kb_statistical_classification . traditionally , amphibians as kb_a kb_class_(biology) are kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as all tetrapods with kb_a larval stage , while the kb_group_(periodic_table) that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians ( frogs , salamanders and caecilians ) and all their descendants is called kb_lissamphibia . the kb_phylogeny of kb_paleozoic amphibians is kb_uncertainty , and kb_lissamphibia may possibly fall within kb_extinct kb_group_(mathematics) , like the kb_temnospondyli ( traditionally placed in the subclass kb_labyrinthodontia ) or the kb_lepospondyli , and in some analyses even in the amniotes . this means that advocates of kb_phylogenetic_nomenclature have removed kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of kb_basal_(phylogenetics) kb_devonian and kb_carboniferous amphibian-type kb_tetrapod kb_group_(mathematics) that were formerly placed in amphibia in kb_linnaean_taxonomy kb_taxonomy_(biology) , and included them elsewhere under kb_cladistic_taxonomy . if the kb_common_descent kb_ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in amphibia , kb_it becomes kb_a kb_paraphyly kb_group_(periodic_table) .kb_asciikb_ascii ( ) , abbreviated from kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) standard kb_code for kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) interchange , is kb_a kb_character_encoding standard for kb_electronic_computer kb_communication . kb_ascii kb_code_(cryptography) represent text in computers , kb_telecommunications_equipment , and kb_other_(philosophy) devices . most kb_modern_history character-encoding schemes are based on kb_ascii , although they support many additional kb_character_(computing) .kb_ascii is the traditional kb_toponymy for the encoding system ; kb_the_internet kb_internet_assigned_numbers_authority kb_grammatical_number kb_authority ( iana ) prefers the updated kb_toponymy us-ascii , which clarifies that this system was kb_adaptation in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) and based on the typographical kb_symbols predominantly in use there .kb_ascii is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_list_of_ieee_milestoneskb_ascii was kb_adaptation from kb_telegraph_code . its kb_first_trimester commercial use was as kb_a seven-bit kb_teleprinter kb_code promoted by kb_bell kb_big_data kb_service_(economics) . kb_cold_working on the kb_ascii standard began on kb_october 6 , kb_u.s._presidential_election,_1960 , with the kb_first_trimester meeting of the kb_american_standards_association kb_continental_association 's ( asa ) ( now the kb_american_national_standards_institute kb_corporate_social_responsibility institute or kb_american_national_standards_institute ) x3.2 subcommittee . the kb_first_trimester edition of the standard was published in 1963 , underwent kb_a kb_major_(united_states) revision during 1967 , and experienced its most recent update during 1986. compared to kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet kb_telegraph kb_code_(cryptography) , the kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_bell kb_code and kb_ascii were both kb_totally_ordered_set for more convenient kb_sorting_algorithm ( i.e. , alphabetization ) of lists , and added features for devices kb_other_(philosophy) than teleprinters .originally based on the kb_english_alphabet , kb_ascii encodes 128 specified kb_character_(computing) into seven-bit integers as shown by the kb_ascii chart above . ninety-five of the encoded kb_character_(computing) are printable : these include the digits `` 0 '' to `` 9 '' , kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_a '' to `` kb_carboxybenzyl '' , kb_upper_case kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_a '' to `` kb_carboxybenzyl '' , and punctuation kb_symbols . in kb_addition , the original kb_ascii specification included 33 non-printing control kb_code_(cryptography) which originated with kb_teleprinter machines ; most of these are now obsolete , although kb_a few are still commonly used , such as the kb_carriage_return return , kb_line_feed and kb_tab_key#tab_characters kb_code_(cryptography) .for example , kb_lower_case `` kb_iodine '' would kb_beryllium represented in the kb_ascii encoding by kb_binary_number 1101001 = kb_hexadecimal 69 ( `` kb_iodine '' is the ninth kb_letter_(alphabet) ) = kb_decimalthe kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) standard kb_code for kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) interchange ( kb_ascii ) was kb_adaptation under the auspices of kb_a committee of the kb_american_standards_association kb_continental_association ( asa ) , called the x3 committee , by its x3.2 ( later x3l2 ) subcommittee , and later by that subcommittee 's x3.2.4 kb_working_group kb_group_(periodic_table) ( now kb_incits ) . the asa became the kb_united_states_of_america_standards_institute of kb_americas kb_corporate_social_responsibility institute ( usasi ) and ultimately the kb_american_national_standards_institute kb_corporate_social_responsibility institute ( kb_american_national_standards_institute ) .with the kb_other_(philosophy) special kb_character_(computing) and control kb_code_(cryptography) filled in , kb_ascii was published as asa x3.4-1963 , leaving 28 kb_code positions without any assigned kb_meaning_(linguistics) , reserved for future standardization , and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) unassigned kb_control_code kb_code . there was some kb_abortion_debate at the kb_time_(magazine) whether there should kb_beryllium more control kb_character_(computing) rather than the kb_lower_case kb_alphabet . the indecision did not last kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) : during may 1963 the ccitt working party on the kb_new_world kb_telegraph kb_alphabet kb_anatolian_hypothesis to assign kb_lower_case kb_character_(computing) to `` sticks '' 6 and 7 , and kb_international_organization_for_standardization organization for standardization tc 97 sc kb_alkaline_earth_metal voted during kb_october to incorporate the change into its draft standard . the x3.2.4 task kb_group_(periodic_table) voted its approval for the change to kb_ascii at its may 1963 meeting . locating the kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) in `` sticks '' 6 and 7 caused the kb_character_(computing) to differ in kb_bit_(horse) kb_pattern from the kb_upper_egypt case by kb_a kb_single_bond kb_bit_(horse) , which simplified kb_case-insensitive kb_character_(computing) matching and the kb_construction of keyboards and kb_computer_printer .the x3 committee made kb_other_(philosophy) changes , including kb_other_(philosophy) kb_new_world kb_character_(computing) ( the kb_brace_(punctuation) and kb_vertical_bar bar kb_character_(computing) ) , renaming some control kb_character_(computing) ( som became start of header ( soh ) ) and moving or removing others ( ru was removed ) . kb_ascii was subsequently updated as usas x3.4-1967 , then usas x3.4-1968 , kb_american_national_standards_institute x3.4-1977 , and finally , kb_american_national_standards_institute x3.4-1986 .revisions of the kb_ascii standard :in the x3.15 standard , the x3 committee also addressed how kb_ascii should kb_beryllium transmitted ( kb_least_significant_bit significant kb_bit_(horse) kb_first_trimester ) , and how kb_it should kb_beryllium recorded on perforated tape . they kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_a kb_9-track standard for kb_magnetic tape , and attempted to deal with some kb_punched_card card formats .the x3.2 subcommittee kb_aircraft_design_process kb_ascii based on the kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet kb_teleprinter encoding kb_systems_analysis . like kb_other_(philosophy) kb_character_(computing) encodings , kb_ascii specifies kb_a correspondence between kb_digital_data kb_bit_(horse) patterns and kb_character_(computing) kb_symbols ( i.e . kb_graphemes and control kb_character_(computing) ) . this allows kb_digital_data devices to communicate with each kb_other_(philosophy) and to process , store , and communicate character-oriented kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) such as written kb_hunnic_language . before kb_ascii was kb_adaptation , the encodings in use included 26 kb_english_alphabet kb_character_(computing) , 10 numerical digits , and from 11 to 25 special graphic kb_symbols . to include all these , and control kb_character_(computing) compatible with the kb_ccitt consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique ( ccitt ) international kb_telegraph kb_alphabet no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal ( kb_ita2 ) standard of 1924 , kb_fieldata ( 1956 ) , and early kb_ebcdic ( 1963 ) , more than 64 kb_code_(cryptography) were required for kb_ascii .kb_ita2 were in kb_turn_(geometry) based on the 5-bit kb_telegraph_code kb_émile_baudot baudot invented in 1870 and kb_patented in 1874 .the committee debated the possibility of kb_a kb_shift_code kb_function_(biology) ( like in kb_ita2 ) , which would allow more than 64 kb_code_(cryptography) to kb_beryllium represented by kb_a kb_six-bit_character_code kb_code . in kb_a shifted kb_code , some kb_character_(computing) kb_code_(cryptography) determine choices between options for the following kb_character_(computing) kb_code_(cryptography) . kb_it allows compact encoding , but is less reliable for kb_data_transmission , as an kb_error in transmitting the kb_shift_code kb_code typically makes kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) part of the kb_transmission_coefficient unreadable . the kb_corporate_social_responsibility committee decided against shifting , and kb_sulfate kb_ascii required at least kb_a seven-bit kb_code .the committee considered an kb_eight-bit kb_code , since eight bits ( octets ) would allow kb_2_(number) four-bit patterns to efficiently encode kb_2_(number) digits with kb_binary-coded_decimal kb_decimal . however , kb_it would require all kb_data_transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice . the committee voted to use kb_a seven-bit kb_code to minimize costs associated with kb_data_transmission . since perforated tape at the kb_time_(magazine) could record eight bits in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_positional_notation , kb_it also allowed for kb_a kb_parity_bit kb_bit_(horse) for kb_error_checking if desired . kb_eight-bit machines ( with octets as the native kb_big_data kb_type_(biology) ) that did not use parity checking typically kb_set_(mythology) the eighth kb_bit_(horse) to 0. in some kb_computer_printer , the kb_high_middle_ages kb_bit_(horse) was used to enable kb_italics printing .the kb_code itself was patterned kb_sulfate that most control kb_code_(cryptography) were together and all graphic kb_code_(cryptography) were together , for ease of identification . the kb_first_trimester kb_2_(number) kb_sulfate called `` kb_ascii sticks '' ( 32 positions ) were reserved for control kb_character_(computing) . the `` kb_space '' kb_character_(computing) had to come before graphics to make kb_sorting_algorithm easier , kb_sulfate kb_it became kb_positional_notation 20 ; for the same kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits . the committee decided kb_it was important to support kb_upper_case kb_sixbit_code_pages alphabets , and chose to kb_pattern kb_ascii kb_sulfate kb_it could kb_beryllium kb_redox easily to kb_a usable 64-character kb_set_(mythology) of graphic kb_code_(cryptography) , as was done in the kb_dec_sixbit kb_code ( 1963 ) . kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) were therefore not interleaved with kb_upper_case . to keep options kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance for kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) and kb_other_(philosophy) graphics , the special and numeric kb_code_(cryptography) were arranged before the kb_letter_(alphabet) , and the kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_a '' was placed in kb_positional_notation 41 to match the draft of the corresponding kb_kingdom_of_great_britain standard . the digits 0–9 are prefixed with 011 , but the remaining kb_nibble bits correspond to their respective values in kb_binary_number , making kb_conversion_to_christianity with kb_binary-coded_decimal kb_decimal straightforward .many of the non-alphanumeric kb_character_(computing) were positioned to correspond to their shifted kb_positional_notation on typewriters ; an important subtlety is that these were based on `` kb_mechanics '' typewriters , not `` electric '' typewriters . kb_mechanics typewriters followed the standard kb_set_(mythology) by the remington no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal ( 1878 ) , the kb_first_trimester kb_typewriter with kb_a kb_shift_code kb_key_(cryptography) , and the shifted values of codice_1 were codice_2 early typewriters omitted `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' , using `` kb_oxygen '' ( kb_capital_letter `` kb_oxygen '' ) and `` l '' ( kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) `` l '' ) instead , but codice_3 and codice_4 pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common . thus , in kb_ascii codice_5 were placed in the kb_second_language stick , positions 1–5 , corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent stick . the parentheses could not correspond to `` 9 '' and `` 0 '' , however , because the kb_place_of_articulation corresponding to `` 0 '' was taken by the kb_space kb_character_(computing) . this was accommodated by removing codice_6 ( kb_underscore ) from `` 6 '' and shifting the remaining kb_character_(computing) , which corresponded to many kb_european_eel typewriters that placed the parentheses with `` kb_group_8_element '' and `` 9 '' . this discrepancy from typewriters kb_light-emitting_diode to bit-paired keyboards , notably the kb_teletype_model_33 kb_rutherford_model 33 , which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to kb_ascii , not to traditional kb_mechanics typewriters . electric typewriters , notably the kb_ibm_selectric ( 1961 ) , used kb_a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers following the kb_ibm_pc ( 1981 ) , especially kb_model_m ( kb_1984_world_rally_championship_season ) and thus kb_shift_code values for kb_symbols on kb_modern_history keyboards do not correspond as closely to the kb_ascii table as kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet keyboards did . the codice_7 pair also dates to the no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal , and the codice_8 pairs were used on some keyboards ( others , including the no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal , did not kb_shift_code codice_9 ( comma ) or codice_10 ( kb_full_stop stop ) kb_sulfate they could kb_beryllium used in kb_upper_case without unshifting ) . however , kb_ascii split the codice_11 pair ( dating to no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal ) , and rearranged mathematical kb_symbols ( varied conventions , commonly codice_12 ) to codice_13 .some common kb_character_(computing) were not included , notably codice_14 , while codice_15 were included as kb_diacritics for international use , and codice_16 for mathematical use , together with the kb_simple_polygon kb_line_(geometry) kb_character_(computing) codice_17 ( in kb_addition to common codice_18 ) . the `` @ '' kb_symbol was not used in kb_continental_europe and the committee expected kb_it would kb_beryllium replaced by an accented `` à '' in the kb_france variation , kb_sulfate the `` @ '' was placed in kb_positional_notation 40 , kb_right-wing_politics before the kb_letter_(alphabet) kb_a .the control kb_code_(cryptography) felt kb_essential_element for kb_data_transmission were the start of message ( som ) , end of address ( eoa ) , kb_end_of_message of message ( eom ) , end of kb_transmission_coefficient ( eot ) , `` kb_world_health_organization are you ? '' ( wru ) , `` are you ? '' ( ru ) , kb_a reserved kb_analyzer control ( dc0 ) , synchronous idle ( sync ) , and acknowledge ( ack ) . these were positioned to maximize the kb_hamming_distance kb_distance between their kb_bit_(horse) patterns .ascii-code kb_order_(biology) is also called `` asciibetical '' kb_order_(biology) . kb_collation of kb_big_data is sometimes done in this kb_order_(biology) rather than `` standard '' kb_alphabetical_order kb_order_(biology) ( kb_collating_sequence sequence ) . the main deviations in kb_ascii kb_order_(biology) are :an intermediate kb_order_(biology) converts kb_upper_case kb_letter_(alphabet) to kb_lower_case before comparing kb_ascii values .kb_ascii reserves the kb_first_trimester 32 kb_code_(cryptography) ( kb_grammatical_number 0–31 kb_decimal ) for control kb_character_(computing) : kb_code_(cryptography) originally kb_intention not to represent printable kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) , but rather to control devices ( such as kb_computer_printer ) that make use of kb_ascii , or to provide kb_metadata about kb_big_data streams such as those stored on kb_magnetic tape .for example , kb_character_(computing) 10 represents the `` kb_line_feed '' kb_function_(biology) ( which kb_causes_of_autism kb_a printer to advance its paper ) , and kb_character_(computing) kb_group_8_element represents `` backspace '' . refers to control kb_character_(computing) that do not include kb_carriage_return return , kb_line_feed or kb_whitespace_(computer_science) as non-whitespace control kb_character_(computing) . except for the control kb_character_(computing) that kb_linguistic_prescription kb_elementary_school line-oriented formatting , kb_ascii does not define any kb_mechanism_(biology) for describing the kb_structure or kb_appearance_(philosophy) of text within kb_a document . kb_other_(philosophy) schemes , such as markup languages , address page and document layout and formatting .the original kb_ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) . the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional , for example where kb_a kb_character_(computing) would kb_beryllium used slightly differently on kb_a kb_computer_terminal link than on kb_a kb_data_stream , and sometimes accidental , for example with the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of `` kb_delete_key '' .probably the most influential kb_single_bond kb_analyzer on the kb_interpretation_(logic) of these kb_character_(computing) was the kb_teletype_model_33 kb_rutherford_model 33 asr , which was kb_a printing kb_computer_terminal with an kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance kb_punched_tape tape reader/punch option . kb_punched_tape tape was kb_a very popular kb_list_of_art_mediums for long-term kb_program_(computing) storage until the 1980s , less costly and in some ways less fragile than kb_magnetic tape . in kb_particular , the kb_teletype_model_33 kb_rutherford_model 33 kb_machine assignments for kb_code_(cryptography) 17 ( control-q , dc1 , also known as xon ) , 19 ( control-s , dc3 , also known as xoff ) , and 127 ( kb_delete_key ) became kb_de_facto kb_corporate_social_responsibility . the kb_rutherford_model 33 was also notable for taking the description of control-g ( kb_code 7 , bel , kb_meaning_(linguistics) audibly alert the operator ) literally , as the kb_units_of_measurement contained an actual kb_bell which kb_it rang when kb_it received kb_a bel kb_character_(computing) . because the keytop for the kb_oxygen kb_key_(cryptography) also showed kb_a left-arrow kb_symbol ( from ascii-1963 , which had this kb_character_(computing) instead of kb_underscore ) , kb_a noncompliant use of kb_code 15 ( control-o , kb_shift_code in ) interpreted as `` kb_delete_key previous kb_character_(computing) '' was also kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by many early timesharing kb_systems_analysis but eventually became neglected .when kb_a teletype 33 asr equipped with the automatic kb_punched_tape tape kb_reader_(academic_rank) received kb_a control-s ( xoff , an abbreviation for transmit off ) , kb_it caused the tape kb_reader_(academic_rank) to stop ; receiving control-q ( xon , `` transmit on '' ) caused the tape kb_reader_(academic_rank) to resume . this technique became kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by several early kb_apollo_guidance_computer operating kb_systems_analysis as kb_a `` handshaking '' signal warning kb_a sender to stop kb_transmission_coefficient because of impending kb_arithmetic_overflow ; kb_it persists to this day in many kb_systems_analysis as kb_a kb_manual_(music) output control technique . on some kb_systems_analysis control-s retains its kb_meaning_(linguistics) but control-q is replaced by kb_a kb_second_language control-s to resume output . the 33 asr also could kb_beryllium configured to employ control-r ( dc2 ) and control-t ( dc4 ) to start and stop the tape kb_punch_(magazine) ; on some units equipped with this kb_function_(biology) , the corresponding kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) lettering on the keycap above the kb_letter_(alphabet) was tape and tape respectively .the teletype could not move the kb_human_head backwards , kb_sulfate kb_it did not put kb_a kb_key_(cryptography) on the keyboard to send kb_a bs ( backspace ) . instead there was kb_a kb_key_(cryptography) marked `` rubout '' that sent kb_code 127 ( del ) . the purpose of this kb_key_(cryptography) was to erase mistakes in kb_a hand-typed kb_punched_tape tape : the operator had to push kb_a kb_button_(control) on the tape kb_punch_(magazine) to back kb_it up , then kb_type_(biology) the rubout , which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with kb_a kb_character_(computing) that was kb_intention to kb_beryllium ignored . teletypes were commonly used for the less-expensive computers from kb_digital_equipment_corporation corporation , kb_sulfate these kb_systems_analysis had to use the kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance kb_key_(cryptography) and thus the del kb_code to erase the previous kb_character_(computing) . because of this , kb_declination kb_video terminals ( by default ) sent the del kb_code for the kb_key_(cryptography) marked `` backspace '' while the kb_key_(cryptography) marked `` kb_delete_key '' sent an kb_escape_character sequence , while many kb_other_(philosophy) terminals sent bs for the backspace kb_key_(cryptography) . the kb_unix kb_computer_terminal driver could only use kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_code to back up , this could kb_beryllium kb_set_(mythology) to bs `` or '' del , but not both , resulting in kb_a very kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) period of annoyance where you had to correct kb_it depending on what kb_computer_terminal you were using ( kb_modern_history kb_electron_shells using kb_readline kb_natural_language_understanding both kb_code_(cryptography) ) . the assumption that no kb_key_(cryptography) sent kb_a bs caused control+h to kb_beryllium used for kb_other_(philosophy) purposes , such as kb_a `` help '' kb_command_economy in emacs .many more of the control kb_code_(cryptography) have been given meanings quite different from their original ones . the `` escape '' kb_character_(computing) ( esc , kb_code 27 ) , for example , was kb_intention originally to allow sending kb_other_(philosophy) control kb_character_(computing) as literals instead of invoking their kb_meaning_(linguistics) . this is the same kb_meaning_(linguistics) of `` escape '' encountered in url encodings , kb_c_(programming_language) kb_string_section , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_systems_analysis where certain kb_character_(computing) have kb_a reserved kb_meaning_(linguistics) . over kb_time_(magazine) this kb_meaning_(linguistics) has been co-opted and has eventually been changed . in kb_modern_history use , an esc sent to the kb_computer_terminal usually indicates the start of kb_a kb_command_economy sequence usually in the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_a so-called `` kb_ansi_escape_code kb_code '' ( or , more properly , kb_a `` kb_control_sequence_introducer sequence introducer '' ) from ecma-48 ( kb_1972_wimbledon_championships ) and its successors , beginning with esc followed by kb_a `` < nowiki > [ < /nowiki > '' ( left-bracket ) kb_character_(computing) . an esc sent from the kb_computer_terminal is most often used as an kb_out-of-band_data kb_character_(computing) used to terminate an operation , as in the kb_text_editor_and_corrector and kb_vi text editors . in kb_graphical_user_interface kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) interface ( kb_graphical_user_interface ) and kb_window_(computing) kb_systems_analysis , esc generally kb_causes_of_autism an kb_application_(computing) to abort its kb_electric_current operation or to kb_exit_(system_call) ( terminate ) altogether .the inherent ambiguity of many control kb_character_(computing) , combined with their historical usage , created kb_problems_(aristotle) when transferring `` kb_plain_text text '' kb_file_(tool) between kb_systems_analysis . the best example of this is the kb_newline problem on various operating kb_systems_analysis . kb_teleprinter machines required that kb_a kb_line_(geometry) of text kb_beryllium terminated with both `` kb_carriage_return return '' ( which moves the printhead to kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the kb_line_(geometry) ) and `` kb_line_feed '' ( which advances the paper kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_line_(geometry) without moving the printhead ) . the kb_toponymy `` kb_carriage_return return '' comes from the kb_fact that on kb_a kb_manual_(music) kb_typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the kb_positional_notation where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary . the entire carriage had to kb_beryllium pushed ( returned ) to the kb_right-wing_politics in kb_order_(biology) to kb_positional_notation the kb_left-wing_politics margin of the paper for the kb_next kb_line_(geometry) .kb_declination operating kb_systems_analysis ( kb_os/8 , kb_rt-11 , kb_rsx-11 , kb_rsts/e , kb_tops-10 , etc . ) used both kb_character_(computing) to kb_mark_waugh the end of kb_a kb_line_(geometry) kb_sulfate that the console kb_analyzer ( originally kb_teleprinter machines ) would kb_cold_working . by the kb_time_(magazine) so-called `` kb_glass ttys '' ( later called crts or terminals ) came along , the kb_fan_convention was kb_sulfate kb_water_well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the kb_fan_convention . when kb_gary_kildall kildall created kb_cp/m kb_he_(letter) was inspired by some kb_command_economy kb_line_(geometry) interface conventions used in kb_declination 's kb_rt-11 . until the introduction of kb_pc_dos kb_dos in 1981 , kb_ibm had no kb_hand in this because their 1970s operating kb_systems_analysis used kb_ebcdic instead of kb_ascii and they were oriented toward punch-card input and kb_line_(geometry) printer output on which the kb_concept of kb_carriage_return return was meaningless . kb_ibm 's kb_pc_dos kb_dos ( also marketed as kb_ms-dos by kb_microsoft ) inherited the kb_fan_convention by kb_virtue of kb_being loosely based on kb_cp/m , and kb_microsoft_windows inherited kb_it from kb_ms-dos .unfortunately , requiring kb_2_(number) kb_character_(computing) to kb_mark_waugh the end of kb_a kb_line_(geometry) introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each kb_character_(computing) when encountered alone . to simplify matters kb_plain_text text kb_big_data streams , including kb_file_(tool) , on kb_multics used kb_line_feed ( lf ) alone as kb_a kb_line_(geometry) kb_terminator_(solar) . kb_unix and kb_unix-like kb_systems_analysis , and kb_amiga kb_systems_analysis , kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome this kb_fan_convention from kb_multics . the original kb_macintosh_os , kb_apple_dos , and kb_prodos , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , used kb_carriage_return return ( cr ) alone as kb_a kb_line_(geometry) kb_terminator_(solar) ; however , since kb_apple_inc. replaced these operating kb_systems_analysis with the unix-based kb_macos kb_operating_system system , they now use kb_line_feed ( lf ) as kb_water_well . the kb_radio shack kb_trs-80 also used kb_a lone cr to terminate lines .computers attached to the kb_arpanet included machines running operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_tops-10 and kb_tops-20#tenex using cr-lf kb_line_(geometry) endings , machines running operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_multics using lf kb_line_(geometry) endings , and machines running operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_os/360 that represented lines as kb_a kb_character_(computing) count followed by the kb_character_(computing) of the kb_line_(geometry) and that used kb_ebcdic rather than kb_ascii . the kb_telnet protocol kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity an kb_ascii `` kb_network_virtual_terminal virtual kb_computer_terminal '' ( nvt ) , kb_sulfate that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and kb_character_(computing) sets could kb_beryllium kb_catalyst_support by transmitting kb_a standard text kb_text_formatting over the network . kb_telnet used kb_ascii along with cr-lf kb_line_(geometry) endings , and software using kb_other_(philosophy) conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt . the kb_file_transfer_protocol transfer protocol kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome the kb_telnet protocol , including use of the kb_network_virtual_terminal virtual kb_computer_terminal , for use when transmitting commands and transferring kb_big_data in the default kb_ascii kb_musical_mode . this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols , and to kb_other_(philosophy) network protocols , such as those used for e-mail and the kb_world_wide_web kb_world_wide_web , on kb_systems_analysis not using the nvt 's cr-lf line-ending kb_fan_convention .the pdp-6 monitor , and its pdp-10 successor kb_tops-10 , used control-z ( sub ) as an kb_end-of-file indication for input from kb_a kb_computer_terminal . some operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_cp/m tracked file kb_length only in units of kb_disk_(mathematics) kb_periodic_table_block and used control-z to kb_mark_waugh the end of the actual text in the file . for these reasons , eof , or kb_end-of-file , was used colloquially and conventionally as kb_a kb_three-letter_acronym kb_acronym for control-z instead of substitute . the end-of-text kb_code ( kb_end-of-text_character ) , also known as kb_control-c , was inappropriate for kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of reasons , while using kb_carboxybenzyl as the kb_control_code kb_code to end kb_a file is analogous to kb_it ending the kb_alphabet and serves as kb_a very convenient kb_mnemonic_device kb_aid . kb_a kb_history common and still prevalent kb_fan_convention uses the kb_end-of-text_character kb_code kb_fan_convention to interrupt and halt kb_a kb_program_(computing) via an input kb_data_stream , usually from kb_a keyboard .in kb_vitamin_c library and kb_unix conventions , the kb_null_character is used to terminate text kb_string_section ; such null-terminated kb_string_section can kb_beryllium known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz , where here kb_carboxybenzyl stands for `` kb_0_(number) '' .kb_other_(philosophy) representations might kb_beryllium used by specialist equipment , for example kb_iso_2047 graphics or kb_hexadecimal kb_grammatical_number .kb_code_(cryptography) 20 to 7e , known as the printable kb_character_(computing) , represent kb_letter_(alphabet) , digits , punctuation marks , and kb_a few kb_miscellaneous_symbols kb_symbols . there are 95 printable kb_character_(computing) in total .kb_code 20 , the `` kb_space '' kb_character_(computing) , denotes the kb_space between kb_lexical_semantics , as produced by the kb_space bar of kb_a keyboard . since the kb_space kb_character_(computing) is considered an invisible graphic ( rather than kb_a kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) ) kb_it is listed in the table kb_#ecclesiastical_history instead of in the previous kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) .kb_code 7f corresponds to the non-printable `` kb_delete_key '' ( del ) kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) and is therefore omitted from this chart ; kb_it is covered in the previous kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) 's chart . kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet versions of kb_ascii used the up kb_arrow_(weapon) instead of the kb_caret ( 5e ) and the kb_left-wing_politics kb_arrow_(weapon) instead of the kb_underscore ( 5f ) .] ]kb_ascii was kb_first_trimester used commercially during 1963 as kb_a seven-bit kb_teleprinter kb_code for kb_american_telephone_&_telegraph & kb_telegraph 's twx ( teletypewriter exchange ) network . twx originally used the kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet five-bit kb_ita2 , which was also used by the competing kb_telex kb_teleprinter system . kb_robert_william_bemer bemer introduced features such as the kb_escape_character sequence . kb_histidine kb_kingdom_of_great_britain colleague kb_hugh_mcgregor_ross mcgregor ross helped to popularize this kb_cold_working according to bemer , `` kb_sulfate much kb_sulfate that the kb_code that was to become kb_ascii was kb_first_trimester called the `` bemer–ross kb_code '' in kb_europe '' . because of kb_histidine extensive kb_cold_working on kb_ascii , bemer has been called `` the kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) of kb_ascii '' .on kb_march 11 , kb_from_the_earth_to_the_moon_(miniseries)#episodes , kb_united_states_navy kb_president_of_the_united_states kb_lyndon_b._johnson b. johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the kb_united_states_federal_government kb_sovereign_state kb_federal_government_of_the_united_states support kb_ascii , stating :kb_iodine have also approved recommendations of the kb_united_states_secretary_of_commerce of commerce [ kb_martin_luther h. hodges ] regarding kb_corporate_social_responsibility for recording the standard kb_code for kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) interchange on kb_magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in kb_apollo_guidance_computer operations .all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the kb_federal_government_of_the_united_states kb_inventory on and after july 1 , 1969 , must have the capability to use the standard kb_code for kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) interchange and the formats prescribed by the kb_magnetic tape and kb_punched_tape tape kb_corporate_social_responsibility when these kb_medes are used .kb_ascii was the most common kb_character_encoding on the kb_world_wide_web kb_world_wide_web until december kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final , when kb_utf-8 encoding surpassed kb_it ; kb_utf-8 is kb_backward_compatibility compatible with kb_ascii .as kb_apollo_guidance_computer kb_technology kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) throughout the kb_world_war_ii , different kb_standardization and corporations kb_adaptation many variations of kb_ascii to facilitate the expression of non-english languages that used roman-based alphabets . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) could kb_class_(biology) some of these variations as `` kb_ascii extensions '' , although some misuse that kb_terminology to represent all variants , including those that do not preserve kb_ascii 's character-map in the 7-bit range . furthermore , the kb_ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as kb_ascii .from early in its development , kb_ascii was kb_intention to kb_beryllium just kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of several national variants of an international kb_character_(computing) kb_code standard .kb_other_(philosophy) international kb_standardization have ratified kb_character_(computing) encodings such as kb_iso_646 ( 1967 ) that are kb_identical_particles or nearly kb_identical_particles to kb_ascii , with extensions for kb_character_(computing) outside the kb_english_alphabet and kb_symbols used outside the united kb_sovereign_state , such as the kb_symbol for the kb_united_kingdom kb_kingdom_(biology) 's kb_pound_sterling ( kb_pound_sterling ) . almost every kb_country_music needed an adapted version of kb_ascii , since kb_ascii suited the needs of only the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) and kb_a few kb_other_(philosophy) countries . for example , kb_canada had its own version that kb_catalyst_support kb_france kb_character_(computing) .many kb_other_(philosophy) countries kb_adaptation variants of kb_ascii to include non-english kb_letter_(alphabet) ( e.g . kb_é , kb_ñ , kb_ß , kb_ł ) , kb_aruban_florin kb_symbols ( e.g . kb_pound_sterling , kb_¥ ) , etc . kb_episcopal_see also kb_yuscii ( yugoslavia ) .kb_it would share most kb_character_(computing) in common , but assign kb_other_(philosophy) locally useful kb_character_(computing) to several kb_code points reserved for `` national use '' . however , the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii-1963 and kb_international_organization_for_standardization 's kb_first_trimester acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused kb_ascii 's choices for the national use kb_character_(computing) to seem to kb_beryllium kb_de_facto kb_corporate_social_responsibility for the kb_world_war_ii , causing kb_confusion and incompatibility once kb_other_(philosophy) countries did begin to make their own assignments to these kb_code points .iso/iec 646 , like kb_ascii , is kb_a 7-bit kb_character_(computing) kb_set_(mythology) . kb_it does not make any additional kb_code_(cryptography) kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance , kb_sulfate the same kb_code points encoded different kb_character_(computing) in different countries . escape kb_code_(cryptography) were kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity to indicate which national variant kb_applied_science to kb_a piece of text , but they were rarely used , kb_sulfate kb_it was often impossible to know what variant to kb_cold_working with and , therefore , which kb_character_(computing) kb_a kb_code represented , and in kb_general_(united_states) , text-processing kb_systems_analysis could kb_coping_(psychology) with only kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) variant anyway .because the bracket and kb_brace_(punctuation) kb_character_(computing) of kb_ascii were assigned to `` national use '' kb_code points that were used for accented kb_letter_(alphabet) in kb_other_(philosophy) national variants of iso/iec 646 , kb_a kb_german_language , kb_france , or kb_sweden , etc . kb_programmer using their national variant of iso/iec 646 , rather than kb_ascii , had to write , and thus kb_walter_read , something such asinstead ofkb_vitamin_c trigraphs were created to solve this problem for kb_ansi_c , although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use . many programmers kept their computers on us-ascii , kb_sulfate plain-text in kb_sweden , kb_german_language etc . ( for example , in e-mail or kb_usenet ) contained `` { , } '' and similar variants in the middle of kb_lexical_semantics , something those programmers got used to . for example , kb_a kb_sweden kb_programmer mailing another kb_programmer asking if they should kb_go_(game) for lunch , could get `` kb_neutron { jag har sm|rg } sar '' as the answer , which should kb_beryllium `` nä jag har smörgåsar '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` no kb_iodine 've got sandwiches '' .eventually , as 8- , kb_16-bit and kb_32-bit ( and later kb_64-bit ) computers began to replace kb_12-bit , kb_18-bit and kb_36-bit computers as the kb_norm_(mathematics) , kb_it became common to use an kb_8-bit kb_byte to store each kb_character_(computing) in kb_memory , providing an opportunity for extended , kb_8-bit relatives of kb_ascii . in most kb_noun_case these kb_adaptation as kb_truth extensions of kb_ascii , leaving the original character-mapping intact , but adding additional kb_character_(computing) definitions after the kb_first_trimester 128 ( i.e. , 7-bit ) kb_character_(computing) .encodings include kb_iscii ( kb_indian_subcontinent ) , kb_viscii ( kb_vietnam ) . although these encodings are sometimes referred to as kb_ascii , kb_truth kb_ascii is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity strictly only by the kb_american_national_standards_institute standard .most early home kb_computer_systems kb_adaptation their own kb_8-bit kb_character_(computing) sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs , and often filled in some or all of the control kb_character_(computing) from 0 to 31 with more graphics . kb_kaypro kb_cp/m computers used the `` kb_upper_egypt '' 128 kb_character_(computing) for the kb_greek_alphabet .the kb_petscii kb_code kb_commodore_international used for their kb_8-bit kb_systems_analysis is probably unique among post-1970 kb_code_(cryptography) in kb_being based on ascii-1963 , instead of the more common ascii-1967 , such as found on the kb_zx_spectrum_character_set kb_visible_spectrum kb_apollo_guidance_computer . kb_atari_2600 kb_8-bit computers and kb_galaksija_(computer)#character_rom computers also used kb_ascii variants .the kb_ibm_pc kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity kb_code_page_437 437 , which replaced the control kb_character_(computing) with graphic kb_symbols such as kb_emoticon faces , and mapped additional graphic kb_character_(computing) to the kb_upper_egypt 128 positions . operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_dos kb_catalyst_support these kb_code kb_pages_(word_processor) , and manufacturers of kb_ibm pcs kb_catalyst_support them in kb_computer_hardware . kb_digital_equipment_corporation corporation kb_adaptation the kb_multinational_character_set kb_set_(mythology) ( dec-mcs ) for use in the popular kb_vt220 kb_computer_terminal as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester extensions kb_aircraft_design_process more for international languages than for block graphics . the kb_macintosh kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity kb_mac_os_roman kb_roman_empire and kb_postscript also kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity kb_a kb_set_(mythology) , both of these contained both international kb_letter_(alphabet) and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics , more like kb_modern_history kb_character_(computing) sets .the kb_iso/iec_8859 8859 standard ( kb_derived_trait from the dec-mcs ) finally provided kb_a standard that most kb_systems_analysis copied ( at least as accurately as they copied kb_ascii , but with many substitutions ) . kb_a popular further kb_extension_(kinesiology) kb_aircraft_design_process by kb_microsoft , kb_windows-1252 ( often mislabeled as kb_iso-8859-1 ) , added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing . kb_iso-8859-1 , kb_windows-1252 , and the original 7-bit kb_ascii were the most common kb_character_(computing) encodings until kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 when kb_utf-8 became more common .iso/iec 4873 introduced 32 additional control kb_code_(cryptography) kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity in the 80–9f kb_hexadecimal range , as part of extending the 7-bit kb_ascii encoding to become an kb_8-bit system .kb_unicode and the iso/iec 10646 kb_universal_character_set kb_set_(mythology) ( ucs ) have kb_a much wider array of kb_character_(computing) and their various encoding kb_theory_of_forms have begun to supplant kb_iso/iec_8859 8859 and kb_ascii rapidly in many environments . while kb_ascii is limited to 128 kb_character_(computing) , kb_unicode and the ucs support

and newer kb_medes with kb_digital_video . the `` kb_look_(american_magazine) '' of traditional kb_cel_animation is still preserved , and the kb_character_(computing) animators ' kb_cold_working has remained essentially the same over the kb_past 70 years . some animation producers have used the kb_terminology `` tradigital '' ( kb_the_lower_depths on the kb_lexical_semantics `` traditional '' and `` kb_digital_data '' ) to describe kb_cel_animation that uses significant kb_apollo_guidance_computer kb_technology .examples of traditionally animated kb_i_shot_andy_warhol kb_adventure_film include

choppy or `` skippy '' kb_movement_(sign_language) animation . kb_limited_animation animation uses fewer drawings per kb_second_language , thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation . this is kb_a more kb_economic_anthropology technique . pioneered by the artists at the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) studio kb_united_productions_of_america productions of kb_americas , kb_limited_animation animation can kb_beryllium used as kb_a method of stylized artistic expression , as in `` kb_gerald_mcboing-boing mcboing-boing '' ( kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , kb_1951_in_literature ) , ``

) and later kb_the_internet kb_internet ( kb_world_wide_web kb_cartoons ) .kb_rotoscoping is kb_a technique kb_patented by kb_max_fleischer fleischer in 1917 where animators trace live-action kb_movement_(sign_language) , frame by frame . the source kb_film can kb_beryllium directly copied from actors ' outlines into animated drawings , as in `` kb_the_lord_of_the_rings lord of the kb_ring_(mathematics) '' ( kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , 1978 ) , or used in kb_a stylized and kb_keyboard_expression manner , as in `` kb_waking_life kb_life_(magazine) '' ( kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , 2001 ) and `` kb_a_scanner_darkly_(film) darkly '' ( kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , kb_winter_olympics_2006 ) . some kb_other_(philosophy) examples are ``

'' ( kb_2013_mediterranean_games ) .kb_films_with_live_action_and_animation is kb_a technique combining hand-drawn kb_character_(computing) into live action kb_shot_(filmmaking) or live action actors

influence and control over the final kb_decay_product as everything is done within the same kb_departments_of_france . speaking about using this approach in `` kb_paperman '' , kb_john_the_baptist kahrs said that `` our animators can change things , actually erase away the cg underlayer if they want , and change the profile of the kb_arm . ''kb_3d_computer_graphics animation is kb_digital_media modeled and manipulated by an kb_animator . the kb_animator usually starts by creating kb_a 3d kb_polygon_mesh to manipulate . kb_a mesh typically includes many kb_vertex_(geometry) that are connected by edges and faces , which give the visual kb_appearance_(philosophy) of kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism to kb_a 3d kb_space_debris or 3d environment . sometimes , the mesh is given an internal kb_digital_data skeletal kb_structure called an kb_armature_(computer_animation) that can kb_beryllium used to control the mesh by weighting the kb_vertex_(geometry) . this process is called rigging and can kb_beryllium used in conjunction with keyframes to create kb_movement_(sign_language) .kb_other_(philosophy) techniques can kb_beryllium kb_applied_science , mathematical functions ( e.g. , kb_gravity_(2013_film) , kb_grammatical_particle simulations ) , simulated fur or hair , and effects , kb_fire_(classical_element) and kb_fluid_animationan kb_animator is an kb_artist kb_world_health_organization creates kb_a visual sequence ( or kb_audio-visual if added kb_sound ) of kb_cross-platform_software sequential images that generate the illusion of kb_movement_(sign_language) , that is , an animation . animations are currently in many areas of kb_technology and kb_video , such as kb_film , kb_television , kb_video_games or kb_the_internet kb_internet . generally , these works require the collaboration of several animators . the methods to create these images depend on the kb_animator and kb_carpel that kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) wants to achieve ( with images generated by kb_apollo_guidance_computer , manually ... ) .animators can kb_beryllium divided into animators of kb_character_(computing) ( artists kb_world_health_organization are specialized in the movements , kb_dialogue and acting of the kb_character_(computing) ) and animators of special effects ( for example vehicles , kb_machinery or kb_natural_number kb_phenomenon such as kb_water , kb_snow , kb_rain ) .the creation of non-trivial animation works ( i.e. , longer than kb_a few seconds ) has kb_adaptation as kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_filmmaking , with certain unique aspects . kb_trait_(biology) common to both live-action and animated kb_feature_film kb_adventure_film are labor-intensity and kb_high_middle_ages production costs .the most important difference is that once kb_a kb_film is in the production kb_phase_(matter) , the kb_marginal_cost cost of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) more shot is higher for animated kb_adventure_film than live-action kb_adventure_film . kb_it is relatively easy for kb_a director to kb_amplitude-shift_keying for kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) more kb_take during kb_principal_photography photography of kb_a live-action kb_film , but every kb_take on an animated kb_film must kb_beryllium manually rendered by animators ( although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by kb_modern_history kb_computer_animation ) . kb_it is pointless for kb_a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating kb_a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the kb_film . thus , animation studios starting with kb_walt_disney_animation_studios began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where kb_storyboard artists develop every kb_single_bond scene through storyboards , then handing the kb_film over to the animators only after the production team is kb_satisfiability that all the scenes make kb_word_sense as kb_a whole . while live-action kb_adventure_film are now also storyboarded , they enjoy more kb_latitude to depart from storyboards ( i.e. , kb_real-time_computing improvisation ) .another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain kb_a kb_film 's consistency from start to finish , even as kb_adventure_film have grown longer and teams have grown larger . animators , like all artists , necessarily have kb_individual kb_art_movement , but must subordinate their individuality in kb_a kb_consistent way to whatever kb_carpel is employed on kb_a kb_particular kb_film . since the early 1980s , teams of about 500 to 600 kb_people_(american_magazine) , of whom 50 to 70 are animators , typically have created feature-length animated kb_adventure_film . kb_it is relatively easy for kb_2_(number) or kb_triliteral artists to match their kb_art_movement ; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult .this problem is usually solved by having kb_a separate kb_group_(periodic_table) of visual development artists develop an overall kb_look_(american_magazine) and palette for each kb_film before animation begins . kb_character_(computing) designers on the visual development team draw kb_rutherford_model sheets to show how each kb_character_(computing) should kb_look_(american_magazine) like with different facial expressions , posed in different positions , and viewed from different angles . on traditionally animated projects , maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators kb_episcopal_see how kb_character_(computing) would kb_look_(american_magazine) from different angles .unlike live-action kb_adventure_film , animated kb_adventure_film were traditionally kb_adaptation beyond the synopsis stage through the kb_storyboard kb_text_formatting ; the kb_storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the kb_film . in the early kb_1960s_in_the_united_states , animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write kb_screenplays ( while also continuing to use story departments ) and kb_screenplays had become commonplace for animated kb_adventure_film by the late 1980s .criticism of animation has been common in kb_medes and kb_film since its kb_inception_(film) . with its popularity , kb_a kb_prespa_lake amount of criticism has arisen , especially animated kb_feature_film kb_adventure_film . many concerns of kb_cultural_anthropology kb_representation_(arts) , kb_psychology effects on children have been brought up around the animation kb_industry , which has remained rather kb_politics_of_albania unchanged and stagnant since its kb_inception_(film) into kb_mainstream_(terminology) kb_albanian_culture .as with any kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_medes , animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field . the original awards for animation were presented by the kb_academy_of_motion_picture_arts_and_sciences kb_motion_(physics) picture kb_arts and kb_sciences for animated shorts from the year 1932 , during the 5th kb_academy_awards kb_function_(biology) . the kb_first_trimester winner of the kb_academy_awards was the short `` kb_flowers_and_trees and kb_trees '' , kb_a production by kb_walt_disney_productions kb_walt_disney_animation_studios productions . the kb_academy_awards for kb_a feature-length animated kb_motion_(physics) picture was only instituted for the year 2001 , and awarded during the 74th kb_academy_awards in 2002. kb_it was won by the kb_film `` kb_shrek '' , produced by kb_dreamworks and kb_pacific_data_images images . disney/pixar have produced the most kb_adventure_film either to win or kb_beryllium nominated for the award . the kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of both awards can kb_beryllium obtained here :several kb_other_(philosophy) countries have instituted an award for best-animated kb_feature_film as part of their national kb_film awards : kb_africa_movie_academy_award_for_best_animation kb_academy_awards for best animation ( since kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 ) , kb_bafta_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film ( since kb_winter_olympics_2006 ) , kb_césar_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film ( since 2011 ) , kb_golden_rooster_award_for_best_animation award for best animation ( since 1981 ) , kb_goya_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film ( since 1989 ) , kb_japan_academy_prize_for_animation_of_the_year prize for animation of the year ( since kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final ) , kb_national_film_award_for_best_animated_film kb_film award for best animated kb_film ( since kb_winter_olympics_2006 ) . also since kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final , the kb_asia_pacific_screen_award_for_best_animated_feature_film kb_screening_(medicine) award for best animated kb_feature_film has been awarded at the kb_asia_pacific_screen_awards kb_screening_(medicine) awards . since kb_2009_in_science , the kb_european_film_awards awards have awarded the kb_european_film_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film .the kb_annie_award award is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation . unlike the kb_academy_awards , the annie awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any kb_other_(philosophy) field of technical and artistic endeavor . they were re-organized in kb_1992_davis_cup to create kb_a kb_new_world field for best animated kb_i_shot_andy_warhol . the 1990s winners were dominated by walt kb_walt_disney_animation_studios , however , newer studios , kb_light-emitting_diode by kb_pixar & kb_dreamworks , have now begun to consistently vie for this award . the kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of awardees is as follows :category : cartooningcategory : kb_article_(grammar) containing kb_video kb_clips_(software)category : kb_film and kb_video technologyapollokb_apollo_program ( kb_attica , kb_ionic_crystal , and kb_homeric_greek : , `` apollōn '' ( ) ;

, `` phoibos '' ) , literally `` bright '' . kb_it was very commonly used by both the kb_greeks and kb_roman_empire for kb_apollo_program 's role as the kb_god of kb_light . like kb_other_(philosophy) kb_ancient_greek kb_deities , kb_he_(letter) had kb_a kb_grammatical_number of others kb_applied_science to him , reflecting the kb_variety_(magazine) of roles , duties , and aspects ascribed to the kb_god . however , while kb_apollo_program has kb_a great kb_grammatical_number of appellations in kb_greek_mythology , only kb_a few occur in kb_latin_literature .kb_apollo_program 's birthplace was kb_cynthus cynthus on the kb_island of kb_deloskb_delphi and kb_actiumkb_apollo_program was worshipped throughout the kb_roman_empire . in the traditionally kb_celts lands , kb_he_(letter) was most often seen as kb_a kb_healing and kb_sun kb_god . kb_he_(letter) was often equated with kb_list_of_celtic_godsthe kb_cult_(religious_practice) centers of kb_apollo_program in kb_greece , kb_delphi and kb_delos , date from the 8th century bce . the kb_delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to kb_artemis , kb_apollo_program 's twin sister . at kb_delphi , kb_apollo_program was kb_veneration as the slayer of kb_pytho . for the kb_greeks , kb_apollo_program was all the kb_deity in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) and through the kb_century_(cricket) kb_he_(letter) acquired different functions which could originate from different kb_deity . in kb_archaic_greece kb_greece kb_he_(letter) was the kb_prophet , the kb_oracular kb_god kb_world_health_organization in older times was connected with `` kb_healing '' . in kb_classical_greece kb_he_(letter) was the kb_god of kb_light and of kb_music , but in popular kb_religion kb_he_(letter) had kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_function_(biology) to keep away kb_evil . kb_walter_burkert burkert discerned kb_triliteral components in the kb_prehistory of kb_apollo_program kb_achilles#worship , which kb_he_(letter) termed `` kb_a dorian-northwest kb_ancient_greek component , kb_a cretan-minoan component , and kb_a syro-hittite component . ''from kb_histidine kb_eastern_hemisphere kb_evolution kb_apollo_program brought the kb_art of kb_inspection of `` kb_symbols and kb_omen '' ( σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα : `` sēmeia kai terata '' ) , and of the kb_observation of the omens of the days . the inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from kb_anatolia . the kb_ritualism_in_the_church_of_england belonged to kb_apollo_program from kb_operation_barbarossa beginning . the kb_greeks created the kb_legalism_(western_philosophy) , the supervision of the kb_order_(biology) of the kb_deity , and the demand for kb_moderation and kb_harmony . kb_apollo_program became the kb_god of shining youth , kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_beauty , kb_fine_(penalty) kb_arts , kb_philosophy , kb_moderation , spiritual-life , the protector of kb_music , kb_divinity kb_law and perceptible kb_order_(biology) . the improvement of the kb_old_testament kb_sultanate_of_rum kb_god , and kb_histidine kb_elevation_angle to an kb_intellectual

kb_physician of the kb_deity in the `` kb_iliad '' , kb_world_health_organization seems to come from kb_a more kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) kb_religion . paeοn is probably connected with the kb_mycenaean_greece `` pa-ja-wo-ne '' ( kb_linear_b : ) , but this is not certain . kb_he_(letter) did not have kb_a separate kb_cult_(religious_practice) , but kb_he_(letter) was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to kb_cure kb_disease . later the kb_greeks knew the original kb_meaning_(linguistics) of the relevant song `` kb_paean '' ( ) . the magicians were also called `` seer-doctors '' ( ) , and they used an ecstatic prophetic kb_art which was used exactly by the kb_god kb_apollo_program at the kb_oracle_machine .in the `` kb_iliad '' , kb_apollo_program is the healer under the kb_deity , but kb_he_(letter) is also the bringer of kb_disease and kb_death with kb_histidine arrows , similar to the kb_function_(biology) of the kb_vedas kb_god of kb_disease kb_rudra . kb_he_(letter) sends kb_a kb_plague_(disease) ( ) to the kb_achaeans_(homer) . the kb_god kb_world_health_organization sends kb_a kb_disease can also prevent kb_it ; therefore , when kb_it kb_organ_stop , they make kb_a purifying ceremony and offer him kb_a kb_hecatomb to ward off kb_evil . when the kb_oath of kb_histidine kb_priest appeases , they pray and with kb_a song they call their own kb_god , the `` kb_paean '' .some common epithets of kb_apollo_program as kb_a healer are `` paion '' ( literally `` healer '' or `` helper '' ) `` epikourios '' ( , `` succouring '' ) , `` oulios '' ( , `` healer , baleful '' ) and `` loimios '' ( , `` of kb_the_plague kb_plague_(disease) '' ) . in kb_classical_antiquity , kb_histidine kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_function_(biology) in popular kb_religion was to keep away kb_evil , and was therefore called `` apotropaios '' ( , `` averting kb_evil '' ) and `` alexikakos '' ( `` keeping off ill '' ; from kb_verb + kb_noun ) . in later writers , kb_the_word_(free_love) word , usually spelled `` kb_paean '' , becomes kb_a mere kb_epithet of kb_apollo_program in kb_histidine capacity as kb_a kb_god of kb_healing .kb_homer illustrated paeon the kb_god , and the song both of kb_apotropaic_magic kb_thanksgiving_day_(united_states) or triumph . such songs were originally addressed to kb_apollo_program , and afterwards to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_deity : to kb_dionysus , to kb_helios , to kb_apollo_program 's son kb_asclepius the healer . about the 4th century bce , the kb_paean became merely kb_a kb_chemical_formula of adulation ; its kb_space_debris was either to implore protection against kb_disease and misfortune , or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered . kb_it was in this way that kb_apollo_program had become recognised as the kb_god of kb_music . kb_apollo_program 's role as the slayer of the kb_python_(mythology) kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_histidine kb_continental_association with kb_battle_abbey and victory ; hence kb_it became the kb_roman_empirethe connection with the dorians and their initiation festival `` kb_apellai '' is reinforced by the month `` apellaios '' in northwest kb_ancient_greek calendars . the family-festival was dedicated to kb_apollo_program ( kb_dorians : ) . `` apellaios '' is the month of these rites , and apellon is the `` megistos kb_kouros '' ( the great kb_kouros ) . however kb_it can explain only the kb_dorians kb_type_(biology) of the kb_toponymy , which is connected with the kb_ancient_macedonian_language word `` kb_pella '' ( kb_pella ) , `` stone '' . stones played an important part in the kb_cult_(religious_practice) of the kb_god , especially in the kb_oracular shrine of kb_delphi ( kb_omphalos ) .the `` kb_homeric_hymn '' represents kb_apollo_program as kb_a kb_northern_hemisphere intruder . kb_histidine kb_arrival_(abba_album) must have occurred during the `` kb_greek_dark_ages ages '' that followed the destruction of the kb_mycenaean_civilization , and kb_histidine conflict with kb_gaia ( mother kb_earth ) was represented by the legend of kb_histidine slaying her kb_decay_product the serpent kb_python_(mythology) .the kb_earth kb_deity had kb_power_(physics) over the ghostly kb_world_war_ii , and kb_it is believed that she was the kb_deity behind the kb_oracle . the older tales mentioned kb_2_(number) dragons kb_world_health_organization were perhaps intentionally conflated . kb_a female dragon kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_delphyne ( ; kb_cf. . , `` kb_womb '' ) , and kb_a kb_male serpent kb_typhon ( ; from , `` to smoke '' ) , the adversary of kb_zeus in the kb_titanomachy , kb_world_health_organization the narrators confused with kb_python_(mythology) . kb_python_(mythology) was the good kb_daemon_(classical_mythology) ( ἀγαθὸς δαίμων ) of the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina as kb_it appears in kb_minoan_civilization kb_religion , but she was represented as kb_a dragon , as often happens in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_european_folklore as kb_water_well as in the kb_east_africa .kb_apollo_program and kb_histidine sister kb_artemis can bring kb_death with their arrows . the kb_human_fertilization that diseases and kb_death come from invisible kb_shot_(filmmaking) sent by kb_supernatural beings , or magicians is common in kb_germanic_languages and kb_norse_mythology kb_mythology . in kb_greek_mythology kb_artemis was the kb_leader ( , `` kb_hegemon '' ) of the kb_nymphs , kb_world_health_organization had similar functions with the kb_norse_mythology kb_elf . the `` elf-shot '' originally indicated kb_disease or kb_death attributed to the kb_elf , but kb_it was later attested denoting stone arrow-heads which were used by witches to harm kb_people_(american_magazine) , and also for kb_healing rituals .the kb_vedas kb_rudra has some similar functions with kb_apollo_program . the terrible kb_god is called `` the kb_archery '' , and the kb_bow_river is also an attribute of kb_shiva . kb_rudra could bring diseases with kb_histidine arrows , but kb_he_(letter) was able to free kb_people_(american_magazine) of them , and kb_histidine alternative kb_shiva is kb_a healer kb_physician kb_god . however the kb_indo-european_languageskb_it seems an kb_oracular kb_cult_(religious_practice) existed in kb_delphi from the kb_mycenaean_greece age . in historical times , the kb_priests of kb_delphi were called kb_labëria ( kb_alkyl ) yadai , `` the double-axe men '' , which indicates kb_minoan_civilization kb_evolution . the double-axe , kb_labrys , was the holy kb_symbol of the kb_crete kb_labyrinth . the kb_homeric_hymn adds that kb_apollo_program appeared as kb_a kb_dolphin and carried kb_crete kb_priests to kb_delphi , where they evidently transferred their kb_religion practices . `` kb_apollo_program delphinios '' or `` delphidios '' was kb_a sea-god especially worshiped in kb_crete and in the kb_islands_(regional_unit) . kb_apollo_program 's sister kb_artemis , kb_world_health_organization was the kb_ancient_greek kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of hunting , is kb_interpretatio_graeca with kb_britomartis ( kb_diktynna ) , the kb_minoan_civilization `` mistress of the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing '' . in her kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century depictions she is accompanied by the `` mister of the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing '' , kb_a kb_male kb_god of hunting kb_world_health_organization had the kb_bow_river as kb_histidine attribute . kb_histidine original kb_toponymy is unknown , but kb_it seems that kb_he_(letter) was absorbed by the more popular kb_apollo_program , kb_world_health_organization stood by the virgin `` mistress of the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing '' , becoming her brother .the kb_old_testament kb_oracle_machine in kb_delphi seem to kb_beryllium connected with kb_a local kb_tradition of the kb_priesthood , and there is not clear kb_evidence_(law) that kb_a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina . this kb_light-emitting_diode some scholars to the kb_eschatocol that kb_pythia carried on the rituals in kb_a kb_consistent procedure through many kb_century_(cricket) , according to the local kb_tradition . in that regard , the mythical seeress kb_sibyl of kb_sultanate_of_rum kb_evolution , with her ecstatic kb_art , looks unrelated to the kb_oracle itself . however , the kb_ancient_greek_astronomy is referring to the kb_existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves , which seem to kb_beryllium kb_confirmation by recent studies .kb_plato describes the priestesses of kb_delphi and kb_dodona as frenzied women , obsessed by `` kb_mania '' ( , `` kb_frenzy '' ) , kb_a kb_ancient_greek word kb_he_(letter) connected with `` mantis '' ( , `` kb_prophet '' ) . frenzied women like sibyls from whose lips the kb_god speaks are recorded in the kb_near_east kb_east_africa as kb_mari,_syria in the kb_2nd_millennium_bc bc . although kb_crete had contacts with kb_mari,_syria from 2000 bc , there is no kb_evidence_(law) that the ecstatic prophetic kb_art existed during the kb_minoan_civilization and kb_mycenaean_greece ages . kb_it is more probable that this kb_art was introduced later from kb_anatoliakb_a non-greek kb_evolution of kb_apollo_program has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) been assumed in scholarship . the kb_toponymy of kb_apollo_program 's mother kb_leto has kb_lydian_language kb_evolution , and she was worshipped on the coasts of kb_anatolia . the inspiration kb_oracular kb_cult_(religious_practice) was probably introduced into kb_greece from kb_anatolia , which is the kb_evolution of kb_sibyl , and where existed some of the oldest kb_oracular shrines . omens , kb_symbols , purifications , and exorcisms appear in kb_old_testament assyro-babylonian kb_literature , and these rituals were

, and that the kb_prophet 's expertise in sacrifices and kb_reform_judaism of funeral practices were of great help to kb_solon in kb_histidine kb_reform_judaism of the kb_athenian kb_state_of_matter . the story indicates that kb_epimenides was probably heir to the kb_shamanism#asia religions of kb_asia_(roman_province) , and proves , together with the kb_homeric_hymn , that kb_crete had kb_a resisting kb_religion up to historical times . kb_it seems that these rituals were dormant in kb_greece , and they were reinforced when the kb_greeks migrated to kb_anatolia .kb_homer pictures kb_apollo_program on the side of the kb_troy , fighting against the kb_achaeans_(homer) , during the kb_trojan_war . kb_he_(letter) is pictured as kb_a terrible kb_god , less trusted by the kb_greeks than kb_other_(philosophy) kb_deity . the kb_god seems to kb_beryllium related to `` appaliunas '' , kb_a tutelary kb_god of kb_wilusa ( kb_troy ) in kb_anatolia , but kb_the_word_(free_love) word is not complete . the stones found in front of the gates of kb_homeric kb_troy were the kb_symbols of kb_apollo_program . kb_a kb_western_esotericism kb_sultanate_of_rum kb_evolution may also

'' however , recent scholars have kb_casting_(metalworking) doubt on the identification of `` qλdãns '' with kb_apollo_program .the kb_greeks gave to him the kb_toponymy `` kb_agyieus '' as the protector kb_god of kb_state_school places and houses kb_world_health_organization wards off kb_evil , and kb_histidine kb_symbol was kb_a tapered stone or kb_column_of_antoninus_pius . however , while usually kb_ancient_greek festivals were celebrated at the kb_full_moon kb_moon , all the feasts of kb_apollo_program were celebrated at the seventh day of the month , and the kb_emphasis_(typography) given to that day ( `` sibutu '' ) indicates kb_a babylonian kb_evolution .the kb_bronze_age#age_sub-divisions kb_bronze_age ( from 1700 to 1200 bce ) kb_hittites and kb_hurrian `` kb_aplu_(deity) '' was kb_a kb_god of kb_plague_(disease) , invoked during kb_plague_(disease) years . here we have an kb_apotropaic_magic situation , where kb_a kb_god originally bringing kb_the_plague kb_plague_(disease) was invoked to end kb_it . kb_aplu_(deity) , kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` the son of '' , was kb_a kb_title given to the kb_god kb_nergal , kb_world_health_organization was linked to the babylonian kb_solar_deity the kb_sun kb_shamash . kb_homer interprets kb_apollo_program as kb_a terrible kb_god ( ) kb_world_health_organization brings kb_death and kb_disease with kb_histidine arrows , but kb_world_health_organization can also heal , possessing kb_a kb_magic_(supernatural) kb_art that separates him from the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_ancient_greek kb_deity . in `` kb_iliad '' , kb_histidine kb_priest prays to `` kb_apollo_smintheus '' , the kb_mouse kb_god kb_world_health_organization retains an older kb_agriculture kb_function_(biology) as the protector from field rats . all these functions , including the kb_function_(biology) of the healer-god kb_paeanunusually among the kb_summer_olympics kb_deities , kb_apollo_program had kb_2_(number) kb_cult_(religious_practice) sites that had widespread influence : kb_delos and kb_delphi . in kb_cult_(religious_practice) practice , kb_delos kb_apollo_program and kb_pythian_apollo kb_apollo_program ( the kb_apollo_program of kb_delphi ) were kb_sulfate distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality . kb_apollo_program 's kb_cult_(religious_practice) was already fully established when written sources commenced , about 650 bce . kb_apollo_program became extremely important to the kb_ancient_greek kb_world_war_ii as an kb_oracular kb_deity in the kb_archaic_greece period , and the kb_frequency of kb_theophoric_names names such as `` apollodorus '' or `` apollonios '' and cities kb_english_alphabet#letter_names `` kb_sozopol '' testify to kb_histidine popularity . kb_oracular sanctuaries to kb_apollo_program were established in kb_other_(philosophy) sites . in the 2nd and 3rd century kb_council_of_europe , those at kb_didyma and kb_clarus pronounced the so-called `` theological kb_oracle_machine '' , in which kb_apollo_program confirms that all kb_deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing , highest kb_deity . `` in the 3rd century , kb_apollo_program fell silent . kb_julian_the_apostate apostatekb_apollo_program had kb_a famous kb_oracle in kb_delphi , and kb_other_(philosophy) notable ones in kb_clarus and kb_branchidae . kb_histidine kb_oracular shrine in kb_abae in kb_phocis , where kb_he_(letter) bore the toponymic kb_epithet `` kb_abaeus '' ( , `` kb_apollon_smyrni_f.c. abaios

were dedicated to kb_apollo_program in kb_greece and the kb_greek_colonies . they show the kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) of the kb_cult_(religious_practice) of kb_apollo_program and the kb_evolution of the kb_ancient_greek kb_architecture , which was mostly based on the rightness of kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism and on mathematical kb_foreign_relations_of_albania . some of the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century kb_egyptian_temple , especially in kb_crete , do not belong to any kb_ancient_greek kb_order_(biology) . kb_it seems that the kb_first_trimester

kb_marble or stone kb_chemical_element of the kb_egyptian_temple of kb_doric_order . the kb_greeks used standard types because they believed that the kb_world_war_ii of kb_object_relations_theory was kb_a series of typical kb_theory_of_forms which could kb_beryllium represented in several instances . the kb_egyptian_temple should kb_beryllium canonic , and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection . from the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century times there were certain kb_biological_rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle kb_buildings . the kb_first_trimester kb_buildings were built narrowly in kb_order_(biology) to hold the roof , and when the kb_dimensional_analysis changed some mathematical kb_foreign_relations_of_albania became necessary in kb_order_(biology) to keep the original kb_theory_of_forms . this probably influenced the kb_theory of kb_grammatical_number of kb_pythagoras , kb_world_health_organization believed that behind the kb_appearance_(philosophy) of things there was the permanent kb_principle_(chemistry) of kb_mathematics .the kb_doric_order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century bc but there was kb_a mathematical problem regarding the kb_positional_notation of the triglyphs , which could n't kb_beryllium solved without changing the original kb_theory_of_forms . the kb_order_(biology) was almost abandoned for the kb_ionic_order , but the kb_ionic_crystal kb_list_of_australian_capital_cities also posed an kb_insoluble problem at the corner of kb_a kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina . both kb_order_(biology) were abandoned for the kb_corinthian_order kb_order_(biology)when kb_zeus ' wife kb_hera discovered that kb_leto was impregnanted by kb_zeus , she banned kb_leto from giving birth on `` kb_solid_earth '' . in her wanderings , kb_leto sought shelter on many lands , only to kb_beryllium rejected by them . finally , she saw kb_delos , kb_a floating kb_island , which was neither kb_a real kb_island nor kb_a mainland . kb_it is said that kb_apollo_program , still in kb_leto 's kb_womb , had informed kb_histidine mother about kb_delos to put an end to her suffering . kb_leto , when welcomed by kb_delos , gave birth there , clinging to kb_a kb_palm_tree .kb_it is also stated that kb_hera kidnapped kb_eileithyiawhen kb_apollo_program was born clutching kb_a kb_golden_eagle kb_sword , the swans circled kb_delos seven times and the kb_nymphs sang in delight . soon after kb_he_(letter) was born , kb_he_(letter) was

kb_island of kb_ortygia and that she helped kb_leto cross the kb_sea_(astronomy) to kb_delos the kb_next day to give birth to kb_apollo_program .as kb_a child , kb_apollo_program is said to have built

kb_2060_chiron , the kb_centaur_(minor_planet) kb_world_health_organization later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods , including kb_apollo_program 's sons . kb_apollo_program also fostered kb_carnus , the son of kb_zeus and kb_europa_(mythology) .kb_marpessa was kidnapped by kb_idas but was loved by kb_apollo_program as kb_water_well . kb_zeus made her choose between them , and she chose kb_idas on the grounds that kb_apollo_program , kb_being kb_immortality , would tire of her when she grew kb_old_testament .kb_sinope_(mythology) , kb_a kb_nymph , was approached by the amorous kb_apollo_program . she made him promise that kb_he_(letter) would kb_ulysses_s._grant to her whatever she would kb_amplitude-shift_keying for , and then cleverly asked him to let her stay kb_a virgin . kb_apollo_program kept kb_histidine promise and went back .kb_bolina was admired by kb_apollo_program but she refused him and jumped into the kb_sea_(astronomy) . to avoid her kb_death , kb_apollo_program turned her into kb_a kb_nymph and let her kb_go_(game) .kb_castalia was kb_a kb_nymph whom kb_apollo_program loved . she fled from him and kb_dove into the kb_castalian_spring at kb_delphi , at the kb_base_(chemistry) of mt . parnassos , which was then kb_english_alphabet#letter_names after her . kb_water from this kb_castalian_spring was kb_sacred_architecture ; kb_it was used to clean the delphian kb_egyptian_temple and inspire the priestesses .kb_cassandra , was kb_a kb_decay_product of kb_hecuba and kb_priam . kb_apollo_program wished to kb_court her . kb_cassandra promised to return kb_histidine kb_love on kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) condition - kb_he_(letter) should give her the kb_power_(physics) to kb_episcopal_see the future . kb_apollo_program fulfilled her wish , but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after . angered that she broke her promise , kb_apollo_program cursed her that even though she would kb_episcopal_see the future , no kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) would ever kb_believe_(tv_series) her prophecies .kb_hestiakb_artemis as the sister of kb_apollo_program , is `` thea apollousa '' , that is , she as kb_a female kb_divinity represented the same idea that kb_apollo_program did as kb_a kb_male kb_divinity . in the pre-hellenic period , their relationship was described as the kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) between husband and wife , and there seems to have been kb_a kb_tradition which actually described kb_artemis as the wife of kb_apollo_program . however , this relationship was never sexual but kb_spirituality , which is why they both are seen kb_being unmarried in the kb_hellenic_periodkb_artemis , like her brother , is kb_weapon with kb_a kb_bow_river and arrows . she is the cause of sudden kb_maternal_death of women . she also is the protector of the kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , especially girls . though she has nothing to do with kb_oracle_machine , kb_music or kb_poetry , she sometimes kb_light-emitting_diode the female kb_greek_chorus on kb_mount_olympus while kb_apollo_program sang . the kb_bay_laurel was kb_sacred_architecture to both . `` kb_artemis daphnaia '' had her kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina among the lacedemonians , at kb_a kb_place_of_articulation called hypsoi . in later times when kb_apollo_program was regarded as kb_identical_particles with the kb_sun or kb_helios , kb_artemis was naturally regarded as selene or the kb_moon .the kb_bay_laurel was kb_sacred_architecture to both . `` kb_apollo_program daphnephoros '' had kb_a kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina in kb_eretria , kb_a `` kb_place_of_articulation where the citizens are to kb_take the oaths .kb_hecate , the kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of kb_witchcraft and kb_magic_(supernatural) , is the kb_chthonic counterpart of kb_apollo_program . they both are cousins , since their mothers - kb_leto and kb_asteria_(titaness)the oldest kb_evidence_(law) found for kb_hecate 's kb_achilles#worship is at kb_apollo_program 's kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina in kb_miletos . there , kb_hecate was taken to kb_beryllium kb_apollo_program 's sister counterpart in the absence of kb_artemis . kb_hecate 's kb_moon kb_nature makes her the kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of the waning kb_moon and contrats and complements , at the same kb_time_(magazine) , kb_apollo_program 's solar kb_nature .as kb_a kb_deity of kb_knowledge_representation and kb_great_power kb_power_(physics) , kb_apollo_program was seen kb_being the kb_male counterpart of kb_athena . kb_being kb_zeus ' favorite children , they were given more powers and duties . kb_apollo_program and kb_athena often took up the role as protectors of cities , and were patrons of some of the important cities . kb_athena was the kb_principle_(chemistry) kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of kb_athens , kb_apollo_program was the kb_principle_(chemistry) kb_god of kb_spartaas patrons of kb_arts , kb_apollo_program and kb_athena were companions of the kb_muses , the former kb_a much more frequent companion than the latter . kb_apollo_program was sometimes called the son of kb_athena and kb_hephaestus due to kb_histidine wise and artistic kb_nature .in the kb_trojan_war , as kb_zeus ' kb_executive_(government) , kb_apollo_program is seen holding the kb_aegis like kb_athena usually does . kb_apollo_program 's decisions were usually approved by kb_histidine sister kb_athena , and they both worked to establish kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law and kb_order_(biology) kb_set_(mythology) forth by kb_zeus .in kb_aeschylus ' `` kb_oresteia '' trilogy , kb_clytemnestra kills her husband , kb_king kb_agamemnon because kb_he_(letter) had sacrificed their kb_decay_product kb_iphigenia to proceed forward with the kb_trojan_war . kb_apollo_program gives an kb_order_(biology) through the kb_oracle at kb_delphi that kb_agamemnon 's son , kb_orestes , is to kill kb_clytemnestra and kb_aegisthus , her lover . kb_orestes and pylades carry out the revenge , and consequently kb_orestes is pursued by the kb_erinyes or furies ( female kb_anthropomorphism of kb_revenge ) .kb_apollo_program and the furies argue about whether the kb_matricide was justified ; kb_apollo_program holds that the kb_chemical_bond of kb_marriage is kb_sacred_architecture and kb_orestes was avenging kb_histidine kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , whereas the kb_erinyes say that the kb_chemical_bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the kb_chemical_bond of kb_marriage . they invade kb_histidine kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina , and kb_he_(letter) drives them away . kb_he_(letter) says that the kb_matter should kb_beryllium brought before kb_athena . kb_apollo_program promises to protect kb_orestes , as kb_orestes has become kb_apollo_program 's kb_supplication . kb_apollo_program advocates kb_orestes at kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial , and ultimately kb_athena kb_biological_rules in favor of kb_apollo_program .the kb_roman_empire kb_achilles#worship of kb_apollo_program was kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome from the kb_greeks . as kb_a quintessentially kb_list_of_greek_mythological_figures , kb_apollo_program had no direct kb_roman_empire kb_cognate , although later kb_roman_empire poets often referred to him as phoebus . there was kb_a kb_tradition that the kb_pythia kb_oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kb_roman_kingdom kb_roman_empire during the reign of kb_tarquinius_superbus superbus .on the occasion of kb_a pestilence in the 430s bce , kb_apollo_program 's kb_temple_of_apollo_sosianus at kb_roman_empire was established in the flaminian fields , replacing an older kb_cult_(religious_practice) site there known as the `` apollinare '' . during the kb_second_punic_war kb_war in 212 bce , the `` kb_ludi_apollinares apollinares '' ( `` apollonian games '' ) were instituted in kb_histidine honor , on the instructions of kb_a kb_prophecy attributed to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) marcius . in the kb_time_(magazine) of kb_augustus , kb_world_health_organization considered himself under the special protection of kb_apollo_program and was even said to kb_beryllium kb_histidine son , kb_histidine kb_achilles#worship kb_adaptation and kb_he_(letter) became kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_tribal_chief kb_deity of kb_roman_empire .after the kb_battle_of_actium kb_actium , which was fought near kb_a sanctuary of kb_apollo_program , kb_augustus enlarged kb_apollo_program 's kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina , dedicated kb_a portion of the spoils to him , and instituted kb_quinquennial games in kb_histidine kb_honour . kb_he_(letter) also erected kb_temple_of_apollo_(palatine) kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina to the kb_god on the kb_palatine_hill kb_hill . sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to kb_apollo_program and kb_diana_(mythology) formed the culmination of the kb_secular_games , held in 17 bce to celebrate the dawn of kb_a kb_new_world era .the kb_tribal_chief apollonian festival was the kb_pythian_games games held every four years at kb_delphi and was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the four great kb_panhellenic_games games . also of kb_major_(united_states) importance was the kb_delia_(festival) held every four years on kb_delos .kb_athenian kb_annual_plant festivals included the kb_boedromia , kb_metageitnia , kb_pyanepsia , and kb_thargelia .spartan kb_annual_plant festivals were the kb_carneia and the kb_hyacinthia .kb_thebes_(greece) every nine years held the kb_daphnephoria .kb_apollo_program 's most common kb_attribute_(role-playing_games) were the kb_bow_river and kb_arrow_(weapon) . kb_other_(philosophy) kb_attribute_(role-playing_games) of kb_histidine included the kb_kithara ( an advanced version of the common kb_lyre ) , the kb_plectrum and the kb_sword . another common emblem was the kb_sacrificial_tripod tripod , representing kb_histidine prophetic powers . the kb_pythian_games games were held in kb_apollo_program 's honor every four years at kb_delphi . the kb_bay_laurel kb_bay_laurel kb_plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the kb_laurel_wreath of victorythe kb_palm_tree was also kb_sacred_architecture to kb_apollo_program because kb_he_(letter) had been born under kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) in kb_delos . kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing kb_sacred_architecture to kb_apollo_program included kb_gray_wolf , dolphins , kb_roe_deer kb_deer ,

kb_god of colonization , kb_apollo_program gave kb_oracular guidance on kb_abraham_lincoln_on_slavery#colonization , especially during the height of colonization , 750–550 bce . according to kb_ancient_greek_astronomy , kb_he_(letter) helped kb_crete or arcadian kb_colonies_in_antiquity found kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_troy . however , this story may reflect kb_a kb_cultural_anthropology influence which had the kb_obverse_and_reverse direction : kb_hittites kb_cuneiform kb_literature mention kb_a minor kb_asian_people kb_god called `` appaliunas '' or `` apalunas '' in connection with kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_wilusa attested in kb_hittites kb_inscriptiones_graecae , which is now generally regarded as kb_being kb_identical_particles with the kb_ancient_greek kb_troy by most scholars . in this kb_interpretation_(logic) , kb_apollo_program 's kb_title of `` lykegenes '' can simply kb_beryllium kb_walter_read as `` born in kb_lycia '' , which effectively severs the kb_god 's supposed link with kb_gray_wolf ( possibly kb_a kb_folk_etymology ) .in literary contexts , kb_apollo_program represents kb_harmony , kb_order_(biology) , and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of kb_dionysus , kb_god of kb_wine , kb_world_health_organization represents ecstasy and disorder . the kb_contrast_(vision) between the roles of these kb_deity is reflected in the adjectives kb_apollonian_and_dionysian and dionysian . however , the kb_greeks thought of the kb_2_(number) qualities as complementary : the kb_2_(number) kb_deity are kb_monk , and when kb_apollo_program at kb_winter kb_left-wing_politics for kb_hyperborea , kb_he_(letter) would leave the kb_pythia kb_oracle to kb_dionysus . this kb_contrast_(vision) appears to kb_beryllium shown on the kb_2_(number) sides of the kb_borghese_vase vase .kb_apollo_program is often associated with the kb_golden_mean_(philosophy) . this is the kb_ancient_greek kb_ideal_(ring_theory) of kb_moderation and kb_a kb_virtue that opposes kb_gluttonykb_apollo_program is kb_a common kb_theme_(byzantine_district) in kb_ancient_greek and kb_roman_empire kb_art and also in the kb_art of the kb_renaissance . the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century kb_ancient_greek word for kb_a kb_statue is `` delight '' ( , `` agalma '' ) , and the sculptors tried to create kb_theory_of_forms which would inspire such guiding kb_computer_vision . kb_ancient_greek kb_art puts into kb_apollo_program the highest kb_degree_(angle) of kb_power_(physics) and kb_beauty that can kb_beryllium imagined . the sculptors kb_derived_trait this from kb_observations_(pierre_belon) on kb_human_kind , but they also kb_embodied_agent in kb_concrete kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , issues beyond the reach of kb_ordinary_(officer) thought .the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the kb_cult_(religious_practice) of the kb_human_body that was essentially kb_a kb_religion activity . the muscular frames and kb_limb_(anatomy) combined with slim waists indicate the kb_ancient_greek desire for health , and the kb_health capacity which was necessary in the hard kb_ancient_greek environment . the statues of kb_apollo_program embody kb_beauty , kb_formal_balance and inspire awe before the kb_beauty of the kb_world_war_ii .the kb_evolution of the kb_ancient_greek kb_sculpture can kb_beryllium observed in kb_histidine depictions from the almost static formal kb_kouros kb_type_(biology) in kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period , to the kb_representation_(arts) of kb_motion_(physics) in kb_a relative harmonious whole in kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period . in kb_classical_greece the kb_emphasis_(typography) is not given to the illusive kb_imagination kb_reality represented by the kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_theory_of_forms , but to the analogies and the kb_interaction of the members in the whole , kb_a method created by kb_polykleitos . finally kb_praxiteles seems to kb_beryllium released from any kb_art and kb_religion conformities , and kb_histidine masterpieces are kb_a kb_mixture of kb_realism_(arts) with stylization .the kb_evolution of the kb_ancient_greek kb_art seems to kb_go_(game) parallel with the kb_ancient_greek kb_philosophy conceptions , which changed from the natural-philosophy of kb_thales to the kb_metaphysics kb_theory of kb_pythagoras . kb_thales searched for kb_a kb_simple_polygon material-form directly perceptible by the senses , behind the appearances of things , and kb_histidine kb_theory is also related to the older kb_animism . this was paralleled in kb_sculpture by the kb_absolute_morality kb_representation_(arts) of vigorous kb_life_(magazine) , through unnaturally simplified kb_theory_of_forms .kb_pythagoras believed that behind the kb_appearance_(philosophy) of things , there was the permanent kb_principle_(chemistry) of kb_mathematics , and that the kb_theory_of_forms were based on kb_a kb_transcendental_number mathematical relation . the kb_theory_of_forms on kb_earth , are imperfect imitations ( , `` eikones '' , `` images '' ) of the celestial kb_world_war_ii of kb_grammatical_number . kb_histidine kb_idea had kb_a great influence on post-archaic kb_art . the kb_ancient_greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation , that would kb_lead to the esthetic perfection . ( kb_aesthetic_canon ) .in kb_classical_greece , kb_anaxagoras asserted that kb_a kb_divinity kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving ( kb_mind ) gave kb_order_(biology) to the seeds of the kb_universe , and kb_platokb_kouros ( `` kb_male youth '' ) is the kb_modern_history kb_terminology given to those representations of standing kb_male youths which kb_first_trimester appear in the kb_archaic_period_in_greece in kb_greece . this kb_type_(biology) served certain kb_religion needs and was kb_first_trimester kb_anatolian_hypothesis for what was previously thought to kb_beryllium depictions of `` kb_apollo_program '' . the kb_first_trimester statues are certainly still and formal . the formality of their stance seems to kb_beryllium related with the kb_egyptian_language kb_stare_decisis , but kb_it was kb_acceptance#self_acceptance for kb_a good kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving . the sculptors had kb_a clear idea of what kb_a kb_thomas_young_(scientist) man is , and kb_embodied_agent the archaic smile of good manners , the firm and springy step , the kb_formal_balance of the kb_human_body , dignity , and youthful kb_happiness . when they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men , kb_it was because men had common kb_semitic_root with the unchanging kb_deity . the adoption of kb_a standard recognizable kb_type_(biology) for kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_time_(magazine) , is probably because kb_nature gives preference in survival of kb_a kb_type_(biology) which has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_beryllium kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by the kb_climatic conditions , and also due to the kb_general_(united_states) kb_ancient_greek belief that kb_nature expresses itself in `` kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_theory_of_forms '' that can kb_beryllium imagined and represented . these kb_theory_of_forms expressed immortality . kb_apollo_program was the kb_immortality kb_god of `` kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_formal_balance and kb_order_(biology) '' . kb_histidine shrine in kb_delphiin the kb_first_trimester large-scale depictions during the kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period ( 640–580 bc ) , the artists tried to draw kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's attention to kb_look_(american_magazine) into the interior of the face and the kb_human_body which were not represented as lifeless masses , but as kb_being full of kb_life_(magazine) . the kb_greeks maintained , until late in their kb_civilization_(series) , an almost kb_animism idea that the statues are in some kb_word_sense alive . this embodies the belief that the image was somehow the kb_god or man himself . kb_a kb_fine_(penalty) example is the kb_statue of the `` kb_sacred_gate kb_kouros '' which was found at the cemetery of kb_dipylon in kb_athens ( kb_dipylon_kouros ) . the kb_statue is the `` kb_object_(philosophy) kb_thing-in-itself itself '' , and kb_histidine slender face with the deep eyes express an kb_intellectual kb_eternity . according to the kb_ancient_greek_astronomy the kb_dipylon was kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_daedalusthe kb_animism idea as the kb_representation_(arts) of the kb_imagination kb_reality , is sanctified in the kb_homeric poems and in kb_ancient_greek kb_egyptian_mythology , in stories of the kb_god kb_hephaestus ( kb_phaistos ) and the mythic kb_daedalus ( the builder of the kb_labyrinth ) that made images which moved of their own accord . this kind of kb_art goes back to the kb_minoan_civilization period , when its main kb_theme_(byzantine_district) was the kb_representation_(arts) of kb_motion_(physics) in kb_a specific moment . these free-standing statues were usually kb_marble , but also the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism rendered in kb_limestone , kb_bronze_age , kb_ivory and kb_terracotta .the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century examples of life-sized statues of kb_apollo_program , may kb_beryllium kb_2_(number) figures from the kb_ionic_crystal sanctuary on the kb_island of kb_delos . such statues were found across the kb_ancient_greek speaking kb_world_war_ii , the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of kb_apollo_program with more than kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hundred from the sanctuary of `` kb_apollo_program ptoios '' , kb_boeotia alone . the last stage in the development of the `` kb_kouros kb_type_(biology) '' is the kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period ( 520–485 bc ) , in which the kb_ancient_greek kb_sculpture attained kb_a full kb_knowledge_representation of kb_human_body and used to create kb_a relative harmonious whole . ranking from the very few bronzes survived to kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) is the masterpiece kb_bronze_age kb_piraeus_apollo . kb_it was found in kb_piraeus , the kb_harbour of kb_athens . the kb_statue originally held the kb_bow_river in its kb_left-wing_politics kb_hand , and kb_a cup of pouring libation in its kb_right-wing_politics kb_hand . kb_it probably comes from north-eastern kb_peloponnesus . the kb_emphasis_(typography) is given in kb_comparative_anatomy , and kb_it is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester attempts to represent kb_a kind of kb_motion_(physics) , and kb_beauty relative to proportions , which appear mostly in post-archaic kb_art . the kb_statue kb_throw_(grappling) some kb_light on an artistic centre which , with an independently kb_adaptation harder , simpler and heavier kb_carpel , restricts kb_ionian_greeks influence in kb_athens . finally , this is the germ from which the kb_art of kb_polykleitosat kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the kb_classical_greece , kb_it was considered that kb_beauty in visible things as in everything else , consisted of kb_symmetry and proportions . the artists tried also to represent kb_motion_(physics) in kb_a specific moment ( kb_myron ) , which may kb_beryllium considered as the reappearance of the dormant kb_minoan_civilization kb_chemical_element . kb_comparative_anatomy and kb_geometry are fused in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) , and each does something to the kb_other_(philosophy) . the kb_ancient_greek sculptors tried to clarify kb_it by looking for mathematical proportions , just as they sought some kb_reality behind appearances . kb_polykleitos in kb_histidine `` kb_aesthetic_canon '' wrote that kb_beauty consists in the kb_hierarchical_proportion not of the kb_chemical_element ( materials ) , but of the parts , that is the interrelation of parts with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) another and with the whole . kb_it seems that kb_he_(letter) was influenced by the kb_theories of kb_pythagoras .the famous `` kb_apollo_program of kb_mantua '' and its variants are early kb_theory_of_forms of the kb_apollo_citharoedus kb_statue kb_type_(biology) , in which the kb_god holds the kb_cithara in kb_histidine kb_left-wing_politics kb_arm . the kb_type_(biology) is represented by kb_neo-attic kb_ottoman_empire kb_roman_empire copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century , modelled upon kb_a supposed kb_ancient_greek kb_bronze_age original made in the kb_second_language quarter of the 5th century bce , in kb_a kb_carpel similar to works of kb_polykleitos but more archaic . the kb_apollo_program held the `` cythara '' against kb_histidine extended kb_left-wing_politics kb_arm , of which in the louvre example , kb_a fragment of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) twisting scrolling kb_french_horn upright remains against kb_histidine biceps .though the proportions were always important in kb_ancient_greek kb_art , the kb_appeal of the kb_ancient_greek sculptures eludes any explanation by kb_hierarchical_proportion alone . the statues of kb_apollo_program were thought to kb_incarnation kb_histidine living presence , and these representations of illusive kb_imagination kb_reality had deep kb_semitic_root in the kb_minoan_civilization period , and in the kb_orthodoxy of the kb_first_trimester kb_ancient_greekin the archaic pediments and friezes of the kb_egyptian_temple , the artists had kb_a problem to fit kb_a kb_group_(periodic_table) of figures into an isosceles kb_triangle_(musical_instrument) with acute angles at the kb_base_(chemistry) .the kb_siphnian_treasury treasury in kb_delphi was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester kb_ancient_greek kb_buildings utilizing the kb_solid_solution to put the dominating kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism in the middle , and to complete the descending scale of height with kb_other_(philosophy) figures sitting or kneeling . the pediment shows the story of kb_heracles stealing kb_apollo_program 's tripod that was strongly associated with kb_histidine kb_oracular inspiration . their kb_2_(number) figures hold the centre . in the pediment of the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina of kb_zeus in kb_olympia_(manet)these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the kb_human_eye for their own visible sake . they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in kb_space , but only as parts in kb_a larger whole . while each scene has its own kb_character_(computing) and completeness kb_it must fit into the kb_general_(united_states) sequence to which kb_it belongs . in these archaic pediments the sculptors use kb_empty_string intervals , to suggest kb_a passage to and from kb_a busy battlefield . the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical kb_pattern and kb_order_(biology) , and this was improved when kb_classical_conditioning kb_art brought kb_a greater kb_freedom and kb_economy_of_alaska .kb_apollo_program as kb_a handsome beardless kb_thomas_young_(scientist) man , is often depicted with kb_a kb_kithara ( as kb_apollo_citharoedus ) or kb_bow_river in kb_histidine kb_hand , or reclining on kb_a kb_tree ( the kb_apollo_lykeios and kb_apollo_sauroctonos types ) . the kb_apollo_belvedere is kb_a kb_marble kb_sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century ; for kb_century_(cricket) kb_it epitomized the ideals of kb_classical_antiquity for europeans , from the kb_renaissance through the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century . the kb_marble is kb_a kb_hellenistic_period or kb_roman_empire copy of kb_a kb_bronze_age original by the kb_ancient_greek kb_sculptor_(constellation) kb_leochares , made between 350 and 325 bce .the life-size so-called `` kb_adonis '' found in 1780 on the site of kb_a `` kb_roman_villa '' near the via labicana in the kb_roman_empire suburb of centocelle is kb_interpretatio_graeca as an kb_apollo_program by kb_modern_history scholars . in the late 2nd century kb_council_of_europe floor kb_mosaic from kb_el_djem , kb_roman_empire `` thysdrus '' , kb_he_(letter) is identifiable as kb_helios by kb_histidine effulgent kb_halo_(religious_iconography) , though now even kb_a kb_god 's kb_divinity kb_nudity is concealed by kb_histidine cloak , kb_a kb_mark_waugh of increasing conventions of modesty in the later kb_roman_empire .another haloed kb_apollo_program in kb_mosaic , from kb_hadrumentum , is in the kb_museum at kb_sousse . the conventions of this kb_representation_(arts) , kb_human_head tilted , lips slightly parted , large-eyed , curling kb_hairstyle cut in locks kb_grazing the kb_neck , were kb_adaptation in the 3rd century bce to depict kb_alexander_the_great great . some kb_time_(magazine) after this kb_mosaic was kb_execution_(computing) , the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century depictions of kb_jesus_christ would also kb_beryllium beardless and haloed .kb_apollo_program has often featured in postclassical kb_art and kb_ancient_egyptian_literature . kb_percy_bysshe_shelley bysshe shelley composed kb_a `` hymn of kb_apollo_program '' ( 1820 ) , and the kb_god 's instruction of the kb_muses formed the kb_grammatical_subject of kb_igor_stravinsky stravinsky 's `` kb_apollon_musagète '' ( 1927–1928 ) . in 1978 , the kb_canadians band kb_rush_(band) released kb_hemispheres_(rush_album) kb_purple_rain_(album) with songs `` kb_apollo_program : bringer of wisdom '' / '' kb_dionysus : bringer of kb_love '' .in discussion of kb_the_arts kb_arts , kb_a distinction is sometimes made between the kb_apollonian_and_dionysian and dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing kb_intellectual kb_order_(biology) and the latter with chaotic creativity . kb_friedrich_nietzsche nietzsche argued that kb_a fusion of the kb_2_(number) was most desirable . kb_carl_jung jung 's kb_apollo_archetype represents what kb_he_(letter) saw as the disposition in kb_people_(american_magazine) to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional kb_distance .kb_charles_handy handy , in `` kb_deity of kb_management '' ( 1978 ) uses kb_ancient_greek kb_deity as kb_a metaphor to portray various types of kb_organizational_culture kb_albanian_culture . kb_apollo_program represents kb_a 'role ' kb_albanian_culture where kb_order_(biology) ,

an iambic `` sesquisyllabic '' kb_pattern , with kb_base_(chemistry) nouns and kb_verbs consisting of an initial , unstressed , kb_redox kb_minor_syllable kb_syllable followed by kb_a stressed , full kb_syllable . this kb_redox of presyllables has kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) among kb_modern_history languages of kb_phonological kb_shapes_(album) of the same original proto-austroasiatic prefixes , such as the kb_causative kb_prefix , ranging from cvc syllables to kb_consonant clusters to kb_single_bond consonants . as for word formation , most

except kb_munda_languages , and kb_a few specialized kb_non-linear_writing in kb_other_(philosophy) austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science .the kb_austroasiatic_languages languages are further characterized as having unusually kb_prespa_lake kb_vowel inventories and employing some sort of kb_register_(sociolinguistics) kb_contrast_(vision) , either between kb_modal_voice ( normal ) voice and kb_breathy_voice ( lax ) voice or between kb_modal_voice voice and kb_creaky_voice voice . languages in the kb_pearic_languages branch and some in the kb_vietic_languages branch can have kb_a

kb_diphthongs or in kb_a few kb_noun_case , such as kb_vietnamese_australian , kb_tonogenesis . kb_vietnamese_australian has been kb_sulfate heavily influenced by kb_chinese_characters that its

mon–khmer comparative dictionary '' . little kb_cold_working has been done on the kb_munda_languages , which are not kb_water_well documented . with their demotion from kb_a kb_primary_education branch , kb_proto-mon–khmer becomes synonymous with proto-austroasiatic .kb_paul_sidwell ( kb_2005_games_of_the_small_states_of_europe ) reconstructs the kb_consonant kb_inventory of

which sidwell has specialized in . sidwell ( 2011 ) suggests that the likely kb_urheimat of austroasiatic is the middle kb_mekong , in the kb_area of the kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages ( approximately where kb_modern_history kb_laos , kb_thailand , and kb_cambodia come together ) , and that the kb_family_(biology) is not as kb_old_testament as frequently assumed , dating to perhaps 2000 bce . peiros ( 2011 ) criticized sidwell 's kb_theory heavily and calls kb_it kb_a bunch of contradictions . kb_he_(letter) show with kb_histidine kb_analysis that the kb_urheimat of austroasiatic is somewhere near the kb_yangtze . kb_he_(letter) suggests the kb_sichuan_basin as likely kb_urheimat of proto-austroasiatic before they migrated to kb_other_(philosophy) parts of kb_central_europe and kb_south_china and than into kb_southeast_asia . kb_he_(letter) further suggests that the kb_family_(biology) must kb_beryllium as kb_old_testament as proto-austronesian and proto-sinotibetan or even older .georg van driem ( 2011 ) proposes that the kb_urheimat of austroasiatic is somewhere in kb_south_china . kb_he_(letter) suggests that the kb_region around the kb_pearl_river_(china) kb_river ( kb_china ) is the likely kb_urheimat of the kb_austroasiatic_languages languages and kb_people_(american_magazine) . kb_he_(letter) further suggests , based on kb_heredity studies , that the migration of kb_kra–dai_languages kb_people_(american_magazine) from kb_taiwan replaced the original austroasiatic kb_hunnic_language but the effect on the kb_people_(american_magazine) was only minor . local austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome kra-dai languages and partially their kb_albanian_culture .the kb_linguistics sagar ( 2011 ) and bellwood ( kb_2013_mediterranean_games ) support the kb_theory of an kb_evolution of austroasiatic along the kb_yangtze_river in kb_south_china .kb_a kb_heredity and kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_research in 2015 about kb_ancient_history kb_people_(american_magazine) in kb_east_asia suggest an kb_evolution and kb_urheimat of austroasiatic in today kb_south_china

of austroasiatic : the kb_mon–khmer_languages languages of kb_southeast_asia , kb_north-east_india kb_indian_subcontinent and the kb_nicobar_islands kb_islands_(regional_unit) , and the kb_munda_languages of kb_east_africa and kb_central_india and parts of kb_bangladesh , parts of kb_nepal . however , no kb_evidence_(law) for this kb_statistical_classification has ever been published .each of the kb_family_(biology) that is written in boldface kb_type_(biology) kb_#ecclesiastical_history is kb_acceptance#self_acceptance as kb_a valid kb_clade . by kb_contrast_(vision) , the

neither of which accepts traditional `` mon–khmer '' as kb_a valid kb_units_of_measurement . however , little of the kb_big_data used for competing kb_biological_classification has ever been published , and therefore can not kb_beryllium evaluated by peer kb_review .in kb_addition , there are suggestions that additional kb_branches_of_science of austroasiatic might kb_beryllium preserved in

link . kb_other_(philosophy) geneticists criticise the kb_zhivotovsky_method method .kb_roger_blench kb_roger_blench ( kb_2009_in_science ) also proposes that there might have been kb_other_(philosophy) kb_primary_education kb_branches_of_science of austroasiatic that are now kb_extinct , based on kb_substratum kb_evidence_(law) in modern-day languages .kb_other_(philosophy) languages with kb_anatolian_hypothesis austroasiatic substrata are :kb_john_the_baptist peterson ( 2017 ) suggests that `` pre-munda '' languages may have once dominated the kb_eastern_hemisphere kb_indo-gangetic_plain plain , and were then absorbed by kb_indo-aryan_languages at an early date as kb_indo-aryan_languages kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) kb_east_africa . peterson notes that kb_eastern_hemisphere kb_indo-aryan_languageskb_paul_sidwell ( kb_2009_in_science ) , in kb_a kb_lexicostatistical comparison of 36 languages which are kb_water_well known enough to exclude loan kb_lexical_semantics , finds little kb_evidence_(law) for internal branching , though kb_he_(letter) did find an kb_area of increased contact between the kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages , such that languages of all kb_branches_of_science apart from the kb_geography_of_albania distant kb_munda_languages and kb_nicobarese_languages show greater similarity to kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages the closer they are to those kb_branches_of_science , without any noticeable innovations common to kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages .kb_he_(letter) therefore takes the kb_conservative view that the thirteen kb_branches_of_science of austroasiatic should kb_beryllium treated as equidistant on kb_electric_current kb_evidence_(law) . sidwell & kb_roger_blench ( 2011 ) discuss this proposal in more detail , and note that there is good kb_evidence_(law) for kb_a khasi–palaungic kb_cladistics , which could also possibly kb_beryllium closely related to khmuic .if this would the case , sidwell & kb_roger_blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) westward . sidwell & kb_roger_blench ( 2011 ) suggest kb_shompen_language as an additional branch , and kb_believe_(tv_series) that kb_a vieto-katuic connection is worth investigating . in kb_general_(united_states) , however , the kb_family_(biology) is thought to have diversified too quickly for kb_a deeply nested kb_structure to have kb_adaptation , since proto-austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the kb_central_europe kb_mekong_river kb_valley relatively quickly .subsequently , sidwell ( 2015a : 179 ) kb_anatolian_hypothesis that kb_nicobarese_languages subgroups with kb_aslian_languages , just as how khasian and palaungic subgroup with each kb_other_(philosophy) . kb_a subsequent computational kb_phylogenetics kb_analysis of the austroasiatic kb_language_family by sidwell ( 2015b ) suggests that austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science may have kb_a loosely nested kb_structure rather than kb_a completely rake-like kb_structure , with an east-west kb_division_(mathematics) ( consisting of kb_munda_languages , khasic , palaungic , and khmuic forming kb_a kb_western_esotericism kb_group_(periodic_table) as opposed to all of the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_branches_of_science ) occurring possibly as early as 7,000 years before present .integrating computational kb_phylogenetics kb_linguistics with recent kb_archaeology findings , kb_paul_sidwell ( 2015c ) further expanded kb_histidine kb_mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into kb_indochina from the kb_lingnan kb_area of kb_south_china , with the subsequent kb_mekong riverine dispersal taking kb_place_of_articulation after the initial kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_neolithic farmers from kb_south_china .sidwell ( 2015c ) tentatively suggests that austroasiatic may have begun to split up 5,000 years b.p . during the kb_neolithic_transition era of kb_mainland_southeast_asia kb_southeast_asia , with all the kb_major_(united_states) kb_branches_of_science of austroasiatic formed by 4,000 b.p . austroasiatic would have had kb_2_(number) possible dispersal routes from the kb_western_esotericism kb_peripheral_nervous_system of the kb_pearl_river_(china) kb_river kb_drainage_divide of kb_lingnan , which would have been either kb_a kb_coastal route down the kb_coast of kb_vietnam , or downstream through the kb_mekong_river via kb_yunnan . both the reconstructed kb_lexicon of proto-austroasiatic and the kb_archaeology record clearly show that early austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers around 4,000 b.p . cultivated kb_rice and kb_millet , kept kb_livestock such as dogs , pigs , and kb_chickens , and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than kb_coastal environments .at 4,500 b.p. , this `` kb_neolithic package '' suddenly arrived in kb_indochina from the kb_lingnan kb_area without kb_cereal kb_cereal and displaced the

kb_thomas_young_(scientist) austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science in kb_indochina such as kb_vietic_languages , kb_katuic_languages , kb_pearic_languages , and kb_khmer_alphabet were formed , while the more internally diverse kb_bahnaric_languages branch ( dating to about 3,000 b.p . ) underwent more extensive internal diversification . by the kb_iron_age , all of the austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science were more or less in their present-day locations , with most of the diversification within austroasiatic taking kb_place_of_articulation during the kb_iron_age .kb_paul_sidwell

in lieu of `` hamito-semitic '' , the kb_russian_alphabet linguist kb_igor_diakonoff diakonoffscholars generally treat the kb_afroasiatic_languages kb_language_family as including the following kb_branches_of_science :although there is kb_general_(united_states) kb_agreement_(linguistics) on these six kb_family_(biology) , kb_linguistics kb_world_health_organization kb_science kb_afroasiatic_languages raise some points of disagreement , in kb_particular :in the 9th century , the kb_hebrew_alphabet grammarian kb_judah_ibn_kuraish ibn kb_quraysh of kb_tiaret in kb_algeria was the kb_first_trimester to link kb_2_(number) kb_branches_of_science of kb_afroasiatic_languages together ; kb_he_(letter) perceived kb_a relationship between kb_berber_languages and

kb_rilindja_kombëtare century , europeans also began suggesting such relationships . in 1844 , kb_theodor_benfey benfey suggested kb_a kb_language_family consisting of kb_semitic_languages , kb_berber_languages , and kb_cushitic_languages ( calling the latter `` kb_ge'ez_language '' ) . in the same year , t.n . newman suggested kb_a relationship between kb_semitic_languages and

.kb_friedrich_müller_(linguist) müller kb_english_alphabet#letter_names the traditional hamito-semitic kb_family_(biology) in 1876 in kb_histidine `` grundriss der sprachwissenschaft '' ( `` outline

kb_egyptian_language , kb_berber_languages , and kb_cushitic_languages ; kb_he_(letter) excluded the kb_chadic_languages kb_group_(periodic_table) . kb_it was the kb_egyptology kb_karl_richard_lepsius richard lepsius ( 1810–1884 ) kb_world_health_organization restricted hamitic to the non-semitic languages in kb_africa , which are characterized by kb_a kb_grammatical_gender kb_grammatical_gender system . this `` hamitic kb_hunnic_language kb_group_(periodic_table) '' was kb_anatolian_hypothesis to unite various , mainly north-african , languages , including the kb_ancient_egyptian_medicine kb_hunnic_language , the kb_berber_languages , the kb_cushitic_languages , the kb_beja_language kb_hunnic_language , and the kb_chadic_languages . unlike müller , lepsius considered that kb_hausa_people and kb_nama_languagein 1912 , kb_carl_meinhof meinhof published `` die sprachen der hamiten '' ( `` the languages of the hamites '' ) , in which kb_he_(letter) expanded lepsius 's kb_rutherford_model , adding the kb_fula_language , kb_maasai_language , kb_bari_language , kb_nandi_languages , kb_sandawe_language and kb_hadza_people languages to the hamitic kb_group_(periodic_table) . meinhof 's kb_rutherford_model was widely kb_catalyst_support into the kb_1940s . meinhof 's system of kb_statistical_classification of the hamitic languages was based on kb_a belief that `` kb_appledesign_powered_speakers of hamitic became largely coterminous with kb_cattle herding kb_people's_party_of_armenia with essentially caucasian origins , intrinsically different from and superior to the 'negroes of kb_africa ' . '' however , in the case of the so-called kb_nilo-hamitic_languages languages ( kb_a kb_concept kb_he_(letter) introduced ) , kb_it was based on the kb_linguistic_typology kb_i_shot_andy_warhol of gender and kb_a `` fallacious kb_theory of kb_mixed_language . '' meinhof did this although kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet kb_cold_working by scholars such as lepsius and johnston had substantiated that the languages which kb_he_(letter) would later dub `` nilo-hamitic '' were in kb_fact nilotic languages , with numerous similarities in vocabulary to kb_other_(philosophy) nilotic languages .kb_leo_reinisch reinisch ( 1909 ) had already kb_anatolian_hypothesis linking kb_cushitic_languages and kb_chadic_languages , while urging their more distant affinity with kb_egyptian_language and kb_semitic_languages . however , kb_histidine suggestion found little acceptance . kb_marcel_cohen kb_paul_cohen ( 1924 ) rejected the idea of kb_a distinct `` hamitic '' subgroup , and included kb_hausa_people ( kb_a kb_chadic_languages kb_hunnic_language ) in kb_histidine comparative hamito-semitic vocabulary . finally , kb_joseph_greenberg greenberg 's 1950 kb_cold_working kb_light-emitting_diode to the widespread rejection of `` hamitic '' as kb_a kb_hunnic_language category by kb_linguistics . greenberg refuted meinhof 's kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_theories , and rejected the use of kb_race_(classification_of_human_beings) and kb_social_anarchism kb_evidence_(law) . in dismissing the notion of kb_a separate `` nilo-hamitic '' kb_hunnic_language category in kb_particular , greenberg was `` returning to kb_a view widely held kb_a half century kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet . '' kb_he_(letter) consequently rejoined meinhof 's so-called kb_nilo-hamitic_languages languages with their appropriate nilotic siblings . kb_he_(letter) also added ( and sub-classified ) the kb_chadic_languages , and kb_anatolian_hypothesis the kb_new_world kb_toponymy kb_afroasiatic_languages for the kb_family_(biology) . kb_almost_all all scholars have kb_acceptance#self_acceptance this kb_statistical_classification as the kb_new_world and continued consensus .greenberg 's kb_rutherford_model was fully kb_adaptation in kb_histidine book `` kb_the_languages_of_africa languages of kb_africa '' ( 1963 ) , in which kb_he_(letter) reassigned most of meinhof 's additions to hamitic to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_language_family , notably kb_nilo-saharan . following kb_isaac_schapera schapera and rejecting meinhof , kb_he_(letter) classified the kb_hottentot_language kb_hunnic_language as kb_a member of the kb_khoisan_languages languages , kb_a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of kb_click_consonant sounds . to khoisan kb_he_(letter) also added the tanzanian kb_hadza_people and kb_sandawe_language , though this view has been discredited as kb_linguistics working on these languages consider them to kb_beryllium kb_language_isolate . despite this , greenberg 's kb_statistical_classification remains kb_a starting point for kb_modern_history kb_cold_working of many languages spoken in kb_africa , and the hamitic category ( and its kb_extension_(kinesiology) to nilo-hamitic ) has no part in this .since the kb_triliteral traditional kb_branches_of_science of the hamitic languages ( kb_berber_languages , kb_cushitic_languages and kb_egyptian_language ) have not been shown to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism an exclusive ( kb_monophyly ) kb_phylogenetics kb_units_of_measurement of their own , separate from kb_other_(philosophy) kb_afroasiatic_languages languages , kb_linguistics no longer use the kb_terminology in this kb_word_sense . each of these kb_branches_of_science is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger kb_afroasiatic_languages kb_family_(biology) .in 1969 , kb_harold_c._fleming fleming kb_anatolian_hypothesis that what had previously been known as kb_western_esotericism kb_cushitic_languages is an independent branch of kb_afroasiatic_languages , suggesting for kb_it the kb_new_world kb_toponymy kb_omotic_languages . this proposal and kb_toponymy have kb_methionine with widespread acceptance .several scholars , including kb_harold_c._fleming fleming and kb_robert_hetzron hetzron , have since questioned the traditional inclusion of beja in kb_cushitic_languages .`` kb_glottolog '' does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of kb_omotic_languages has been established , nor that of kb_ongota_language or the unclassified kb_kujarge_language . kb_it therefore splits off the following kb_group_(mathematics) as small kb_family_(biology) : kb_south_omotic_languages , kb_mao_languages , kb_dizoid_languages , kb_gonga–gimojan_languages ( kb_north kb_omotic_languages apart from the

kb_afroasiatic_languages : kb_semitic_languages , kb_egyptian_language , kb_berber_languages , kb_chadic_languages , kb_cushitic_languages , and kb_omotic_languages . however , kb_christopher_ehret ehret ( 1979 ) , kb_harold_c._fleming fleming ( 1981 ) , and kb_joseph_greenberg greenberg ( 1981 ) all agree that the kb_omotic_languages branch split from the rest kb_first_trimester .otherwise

kb_grammatical_number divided by the count of kb_grammatical_number in the kb_class_(set_theory) . the kb_class_(set_theory) is often kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of results of an kb_experiment or an kb_observational_study , or frequently kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of results from kb_a kb_survey_(statistics) . the kb_terminology `` kb_arithmetic kb_mean '' is preferred in some contexts in kb_mathematics and kb_statistics because kb_it helps distinguish kb_it from kb_other_(philosophy) means , such as the kb_geometric_mean and the kb_harmonic_mean .in kb_addition to kb_mathematics and kb_statistics , the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is used frequently in many diverse fields such as kb_economics , kb_anthropological_linguistics , and kb_history , and kb_it is used in almost every academic field to some extent . for example , kb_per_capita_income kb_income is the kb_arithmetic average kb_income of kb_a nation 's kb_population .while the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is often used to report kb_central_tendency , kb_it is not kb_a kb_robust_statistic statistic , kb_meaning_(linguistics) that kb_it is greatly influenced by outliers ( values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values ) . notably , for skewed distributions , such as the kb_distribution_of_income of kb_income for which kb_a few kb_people_(american_magazine) 's incomes are substantially greater than most kb_people_(american_magazine) 's , the kb_arithmetic kb_mean may not coincide with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's notion of `` middle '' , and robust kb_statistics , such as the kb_medes , may kb_beryllium kb_a better description of kb_central_europe tendency .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean ( or kb_mean or average ) , formula_1 ( kb_walter_read formula_2 `` bar '' ) , is the kb_mean of the formula_3 values formula_4 .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is the most commonly used and readily understood kb_measure_(mathematics) of kb_central_europe tendency in kb_a kb_data_set . in kb_statistics , the kb_terminology average refers to any of the measures of kb_central_europe tendency . the kb_arithmetic kb_mean of kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of observed kb_big_data is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as kb_being equal to the kb_addition of the numerical values of each and every kb_observation divided by the total kb_grammatical_number of kb_observations_(pierre_belon) . symbolically , if we have kb_a kb_data_set consisting of the values formula_5 , then the kb_arithmetic kb_mean formula_6 is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity by the kb_chemical_formula :( kb_episcopal_see kb_summation for an explanation of the kb_summation_operator ) .for example , let kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of kb_a firm : 2500 , 2700 , 2400 , 2300 , 2550 , 2650 , 2750 , 2450 , 2600 , 2400. the kb_arithmetic kb_mean isif the kb_data_set is kb_a kb_statistical_population ( i.e. , consists of every possible kb_observation and not just kb_a subset of them ) , then the kb_mean of that kb_population is called the kb_population kb_mean . if the kb_data_set is kb_a kb_sampling_(statistics) ( kb_a subset of the kb_population ) , we call the statistic resulting from this kb_calculation kb_a kb_sample_(statistics) kb_mean .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean has several kb_chemical_property that make kb_it useful , especially as kb_a kb_measure_(mathematics) of kb_central_europe tendency . these include :the kb_arithmetic kb_mean may kb_beryllium contrasted with the kb_medes . the kb_medes is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity such that no more than half the values are larger than , and no more than half are smaller than , the kb_medes . if kb_chemical_element in the kb_big_data kb_arithmetic_progression arithmeticallyif kb_a numerical kb_property , and any kb_sample_(statistics) of kb_big_data from kb_it , could kb_take on any kb_lightness from kb_a kb_continuous_function range , instead of , for example , just integers , then the kb_probability of kb_a kb_grammatical_number falling into some range of possible values can kb_beryllium described by integrating kb_a kb_continuous_probability_distribution distribution across this range , even when the naive kb_probability for kb_a kb_sample_(statistics) kb_grammatical_number taking kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) certain kb_lightness from infinitely many is kb_0_(number) . the kb_analog_device of kb_a kb_weighted_average average in this kb_context_(language_use) , in which there are an kb_infinite_set kb_grammatical_number of possibilities for the precise kb_lightness of the variable in each range , is called the `` kb_mean of the kb_probability_distribution '' . kb_a most widely encountered kb_probability_distribution is called the kb_normal_distribution distribution ; kb_it has the kb_property that all measures of its kb_central_europe tendency , including not just the kb_mean but also the aforementioned kb_medes and the kb_musical_mode ( the kb_triliteral kb_mole_(unit) 's ) , are equal to each kb_other_(philosophy) . this equality does not hold for kb_other_(philosophy) kb_probability distributions , as illustrated for the kb_lognormal_distribution distribution here

artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range . kb_a kb_solid_solution to this problem is to use the kb_optimization_theory formulation ( kb_viz. , define the kb_mean as the kb_central_europe point : the point about which kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) has the lowest kb_dispersion_(optics) ) , and redefine the difference as kb_a modular kb_distance ( i.e. , the kb_distance on the kb_circle : kb_sulfate the modular kb_distance between 1° and 359° is 2° , not 358° ) .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is often denoted by kb_a bar , for example as in formula_1 (

kb_joseph_stalin and hostile to moscow-directed kb_stalinism , an kb_orientation_(geometry) that was critically shaped by kb_histidine experiences during the kb_spanish_civil_war kb_war . the

kb_tetrapod vertebrates of the kb_class_(biology) amphibia . kb_modern_history amphibians are all kb_lissamphibia . they inhabit kb_a wide kb_variety_(magazine) of habitats , with most kb_species living within kb_terrestrial_animal , kb_fossorial , kb_arboreal or kb_freshwater kb_aquatic_ecosystems . thus amphibians typically start out as kb_larvae living in kb_water , but some kb_species have kb_adaptation behavioural adaptations to bypass this . the kb_thomas_young_(scientist) generally undergo kb_metamorphosis from kb_larva with gills to an adult air-breathing kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism with kb_artificial_lung . amphibians use their kb_skin as kb_a kb_secondary_school kb_respiration_(physiology) kb_surface_(topology) and some small kb_terrestrial_animal salamanders and frogs lack kb_artificial_lung and rely entirely on their kb_skin . they are superficially similar to kb_lizards but , along with mammals and kb_birds , reptiles are amniotes and do not require kb_water bodies in which to kb_breed . with their kb_complex_number reproductive needs and permeable kb_seed_coat , amphibians are often ecological indicators ; in

features that were helpful in adapting to dry kb_albanian_land_force . they diversified and became kb_dominant_allele during the kb_carboniferous and kb_permian periods , but were later displaced by reptiles and kb_other_(philosophy) vertebrates . over kb_time_(magazine) , amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity , leaving only the kb_modern_history subclass kb_lissamphibia .the kb_triliteral kb_modern_history kb_order_(biology) of amphibians are kb_anura_(frog) ( the frogs and toads ) , kb_urodela ( the salamanders ) , and kb_caecilian ( the caecilians ) . the kb_grammatical_number of known kb_amphibian kb_species is approximately 7,000 , of which nearly 90 % are frogs . the smallest kb_amphibian ( and kb_vertebrate ) in the kb_world_war_ii is kb_a kb_frog

kb_andrias davidianus '' ) , but this is dwarfed by the kb_extinct `` kb_prionosuchus '' from the middle kb_permian of kb_brazil . the kb_science of amphibians is called kb_batrachology , while the kb_science of both reptiles and amphibians is called kb_herpetologykb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_amphibian '' is kb_derived_trait from the kb_ancient_greek kb_terminology ἀμφίβιος ( `` amphíbios '' ) , which means `` both kinds of kb_life_(magazine) '' , `` ἀμφί '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` of both kinds '' and `` βιος '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_life_(magazine) '' . the kb_terminology was initially used as kb_a kb_general_(united_states) kb_adjective for kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing that could live on kb_albanian_land_force or in kb_water , including kb_pinniped and otters . traditionally , the kb_class_(biology) amphibia includes all kb_tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes . amphibia in its widest kb_word_sense ( `` kb_sensu_lato '' ) was divided into kb_triliteral kb_class_(biology)the actual kb_grammatical_number of kb_species in each kb_group_(periodic_table) depends on the kb_taxonomy_(general) kb_statistical_classification followed . the kb_2_(number) most common kb_systems_analysis are the kb_statistical_classification kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by the website amphibiaweb , kb_university_of_california kb_california , kb_george_berkeley and the kb_statistical_classification by kb_herpetology kb_darrel_frost frost and the kb_american_museum_of_natural_history of kb_natural_number kb_history , kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance as the online reference database `` kb_amphibian kb_species of the kb_world_war_ii '' . the kb_grammatical_number of kb_species cited above follows frost and the total kb_grammatical_number of known kb_amphibian kb_species is over 7,000 , of which nearly 90 % are frogs .with the kb_phylogenetics kb_statistical_classification , the taxon kb_labyrinthodontia has been discarded as kb_it is kb_a kb_paraphyly kb_group_(periodic_table) without unique kb_definable_set features apart from kb_cladistics#plesiomorphy kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) characteristics . kb_statistical_classification varies according to the preferred kb_phylogeny of the author and whether they use kb_a kb_cladistics#three_definitions_of_clade or kb_a node-based kb_statistical_classification . traditionally , amphibians as kb_a kb_class_(biology) are kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as all tetrapods with kb_a larval stage , while the kb_group_(periodic_table) that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians ( frogs , salamanders and caecilians ) and all their descendants is called kb_lissamphibia . the kb_phylogeny of kb_paleozoic amphibians is kb_uncertainty , and kb_lissamphibia may possibly fall within kb_extinct kb_group_(mathematics) , like the kb_temnospondyli ( traditionally placed in the subclass kb_labyrinthodontia ) or the kb_lepospondyli , and in some analyses even in the amniotes . this means that advocates of kb_phylogenetic_nomenclature have removed kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of kb_basal_(phylogenetics) kb_devonian and kb_carboniferous amphibian-type kb_tetrapod kb_group_(mathematics) that were formerly placed in amphibia in kb_linnaean_taxonomy kb_taxonomy_(biology) , and included them elsewhere under kb_cladistic_taxonomy . if the kb_common_descent kb_ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in amphibia , kb_it becomes kb_a kb_paraphyly kb_group_(periodic_table) .all kb_modern_history amphibians are included in the subclass kb_lissamphibia , which is usually considered kb_a kb_clade , kb_a kb_group_(periodic_table) of kb_species that have kb_evolution_of_tetrapods from kb_a kb_common_descent kb_ancestor . the kb_triliteral kb_modern_history kb_order_(biology) are kb_anura_(frog) ( the frogs and toads ) , kb_caudata ( or kb_urodela , the salamanders ) , and kb_gymnophiona ( or kb_caecilian , the caecilians ) . kb_it has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from kb_a temnospondyl-like kb_ancestor , and even that caecilians are the kb_sister_group kb_group_(periodic_table) of the advanced kb_reptiliomorpha amphibians , and thus of amniotes . although the fossils of several older proto-frogs with kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) characteristics are known , the oldest `` kb_truth kb_frog '' is `` kb_prosalirus_bitis bitis '' , from the kb_early_jurassic kb_jurassic kb_kayenta_formation formation of arizona . kb_it is anatomically very similar to kb_modern_history frogs . the oldest known kb_caecilian is another kb_early_jurassic kb_jurassic kb_species , `` kb_eocaecilia_micropodia micropodia '' , also from arizona . the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century kb_salamander is `` kb_beiyanerpeton_jianpingensis jianpingensis '' from the kb_late_jurassic kb_jurassic of kb_northern_mountain_range_(albania) kb_china .authorities disagree as to whether salientia is kb_a kb_superorder that includes the kb_order_(biology) kb_anura_(frog) , or whether kb_anura_(frog) is kb_a sub-order of the kb_order_(biology) salientia . the kb_lissamphibia are traditionally divided into kb_triliteral kb_order_(biology) , but an kb_extinct salamander-like kb_family_(biology) , the kb_albanerpetontidae , is now considered part of kb_lissamphibia alongside the kb_superorder salientia . furthermore , salientia includes all kb_triliteral recent kb_order_(biology) plus the kb_triassic proto-frog , `` kb_triadobatrachus '' .the kb_first_trimester kb_major_(united_states) kb_group_(mathematics) of amphibians kb_adaptation in the kb_devonian period , around 370 million years ago , from kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish which were similar to the kb_modern_history kb_coelacanth and kb_lungfish . these kb_ancient_history kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish had kb_evolution_of_tetrapods multi-jointed leg-like kb_fish_fin with digits that enabled them to crawl along the kb_sea_(astronomy) bottom . some kb_fish had kb_adaptation kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) kb_artificial_lung to help them breathe kb_air_(classical_element) when the stagnant pools of the kb_devonian swamps were low in kb_oxygen . they could also use their kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_fish_fin to hoist themselves out of the kb_water and onto dry kb_albanian_land_force if circumstances kb_sulfate required . eventually , their bony kb_fish_fin would kb_evolution into kb_limb_(anatomy) and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods , including kb_modern_history amphibians , reptiles , kb_birds , and mammals . despite kb_being able to crawl on kb_albanian_land_force , many of these kb_prehistory kb_tetrapodomorph kb_fish still spent most of their kb_time_(magazine) in the kb_water . they had started to develop kb_artificial_lung , but still breathed predominantly with gills .many examples of kb_species showing kb_transitional_fossil features have been discovered . `` kb_ichthyostega '' was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) amphibians , with nostrils and more efficient kb_artificial_lung . kb_it had four sturdy kb_limb_(anatomy) , kb_a kb_neck , kb_a kb_tail with kb_fish_fin and kb_a skull very similar to that of the kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish , `` kb_eusthenopteron '' . amphibians kb_evolution_of_tetrapods adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the kb_water for longer periods . their kb_artificial_lung improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger , better able to support the weight of their bodies on kb_albanian_land_force . they kb_adaptation `` hands '' and `` kb_foot '' with five or more digits ; the kb_skin became more capable of retaining kb_human_body fluids and resisting kb_desiccation . the kb_fish 's kb_hyomandibula kb_bone in the kb_hyoid_bone kb_region behind the gills diminished in size and became the kb_stapes of the kb_amphibian kb_ear , an kb_adaptation necessary for kb_hearing_loss on dry kb_albanian_land_force . an affinity between the amphibians and the kb_teleost kb_fish is the multi-folded kb_structure of the kb_tooth and the paired kb_occipital_bone kb_bones_(studio)at the end of the kb_devonian period ( 360 million years ago ) , the seas , kb_list_of_rivers_of_alberta and kb_list_of_lakes_in_alberta were teeming with kb_life_(magazine) while the kb_albanian_land_force was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates , though some , such as `` kb_ichthyostega '' , may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the kb_water . kb_it is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs , dragging their hindquarters in kb_a similar manner to that used by the kb_elephant_seal . in the early kb_carboniferous ( 360 to 345 million years ago ) , the kb_climate_of_albania became wet and warm . extensive swamps kb_adaptation with mosses , ferns , horsetails and kb_calamites . air-breathing arthropods kb_evolution_of_tetrapods and invaded the kb_albanian_land_force where they provided kb_food_industry for the kb_carnivore amphibians that began to kb_ego_psychology to the kb_terrestrial_animal environment . there were no kb_other_(philosophy) tetrapods on the kb_albanian_land_force and the amphibians were at the top of the kb_food_chain , occupying the ecological kb_positional_notation currently held by the kb_crocodile . though equipped with kb_limb_(anatomy) and the ability to breathe kb_air_(classical_element) , most still had kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) tapering kb_human_body and kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_tail . they were the top kb_albanian_land_force kb_predation , sometimes reaching several metres in kb_length , preying on the kb_prespa_lake insects of the period and the many types of kb_fish in the kb_water . they still needed to return to kb_water to lay their shell-less kb_eggs_as_food , and even most kb_modern_history amphibians have kb_a fully kb_aquatic_plant larval stage with gills like their kb_fish ancestors . kb_it was the development of the kb_amniote egg , which prevents the developing kb_embryo from drying out , that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on kb_albanian_land_force and which kb_light-emitting_diode to their kb_dominance_(ecology) in the period that followed .after the kb_carboniferous_rainforest_collapse collapse kb_amphibian kb_dominance_(ecology) gave way to reptiles , and amphibians were further devastated by the kb_permian–triassic_extinction_event kb_extinction_event . during the kb_triassic ( 250 to 200 million years ago ) , the reptiles continued to out-compete the amphibians , leading to kb_a kb_redox in both the amphibians ' size and their importance in the kb_biosphere . according to the kb_fossil_record , kb_lissamphibia , which includes all kb_modern_history amphibians and is the only surviving lineage , may have branched off from the kb_extinct kb_group_(mathematics) kb_temnospondyli and kb_lepospondyli at some period between the late kb_carboniferous and the early kb_triassic . the relative kb_scarcity of kb_fossil kb_evidence_(law) precludes precise dating , but the most recent kb_molecular_genetics kb_science , based on kb_multilocus_sequence_typing sequence typing , suggests kb_a late carboniferous/early kb_permianthe origins and evolutionary relationships between the kb_triliteral main kb_group_(mathematics) of amphibians is kb_a kb_matter of kb_abortion_debate . kb_a kb_2005_games_of_the_small_states_of_europe kb_molecular_genetics kb_phylogeny , based on kb_ribosomal_dna kb_analysis , suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each kb_other_(philosophy) than they are to frogs . kb_it also appears that the kb_divergence of the kb_triliteral kb_group_(mathematics) took kb_place_of_articulation in the kb_paleozoic or early kb_mesozoic ( around 250 million years ago ) , before the breakup of the kb_supercontinent kb_pangaea and soon after their kb_divergence from the kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish . the briefness of this period , and the swiftness with which kb_radiation took kb_place_of_articulation , would help account for the relative kb_scarcity of kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) kb_amphibian fossils . there are kb_prespa_lake gaps in the kb_fossil_record , but the discovery of kb_a kb_gerobatrachus_hottoni hottoni from the early kb_permian in kb_texas in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 provided kb_a missing link with many of the characteristics of kb_modern_history frogs . kb_molecular_phylogenetics suggests that the frog–salamander kb_divergence took kb_place_of_articulation considerably kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet than the kb_paleontology kb_evidence_(law) indicates . newer kb_research indicates that the kb_common_descent kb_ancestor of all lissamphibians lived about 315 million years ago , and that kb_stereospondyli are the closest relatives to the caecilians .as they kb_evolution_of_tetrapods from lunged kb_fish , amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on kb_albanian_land_force , including the need to develop kb_new_world means of locomotion . in the kb_water , the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward , but on kb_albanian_land_force , quite different mechanisms were required . their vertebral columns , kb_limb_(anatomy) , kb_lunar_limb girdles and musculature needed to kb_beryllium kb_strong_nuclear_force enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding . kb_terrestrial_animal adults discarded their kb_lateral_line kb_line_(geometry) kb_systems_analysis and adapted their kb_sensory_system kb_systems_analysis to receive kb_stimulus_(psychology) via the kb_list_of_art_mediums of the kb_air_(classical_element) . they needed to develop kb_new_world methods to regulate their kb_human_body kb_heat_(1972_film) to kb_coping_(psychology) with fluctuations in ambient kb_temperature . they kb_adaptation behaviours suitable for kb_biological_reproduction in kb_a kb_terrestrial_animal environment . their kb_seed_coat were exposed to harmful kb_ultraviolet kb_ray_(geometry) that had previously been absorbed by the kb_water . the kb_skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive kb_water loss .the superclass kb_tetrapoda is divided into four classes of kb_vertebrate kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing with four kb_limb_(anatomy) . reptiles , kb_birds and mammals are amniotes , the kb_eggs_as_food of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes , some of which are impervious . lacking these membranes , amphibians require kb_water bodies for kb_biological_reproduction , although some kb_species have kb_adaptation various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable kb_aquatic_plant larval stage . they are not found in the kb_sea_(astronomy) with the exception of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or kb_2_(number) frogs that live in kb_brackish_water kb_water in kb_mangrove swamps ; the anderson 's kb_salamander meanwhile occurs in brackish or kb_salt_(chemistry) kb_water kb_list_of_lakes_in_alberta . on kb_albanian_land_force , amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their kb_skin damp .the smallest kb_amphibian ( and kb_vertebrate ) in the kb_world_war_ii is kb_a kb_microhylid kb_frog from kb_new_guinea ( `` kb_paedophryne_amauensis amauensis '' ) kb_first_trimester discovered in 2012. kb_it has an average kb_length of and is part of kb_a kb_genus that contains four of the kb_world_war_ii 's ten smallest kb_frog kb_species . the kb_largest_organisms living kb_amphibian is the kb_chinese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias davidianus '' ) but this is kb_a great deal smaller than the kb_largest_organisms kb_amphibian that ever existed—the kb_extinct `` kb_prionosuchus '' , kb_a crocodile-like temnospondyl dating to 270 million years ago from the middle kb_permian of kb_brazil ! the kb_largest_organisms kb_frog is the kb_african_plate kb_goliath_frog kb_frog ( `` conraua goliath '' ) , which can reach and weigh .amphibians are ectothermic ( cold-blooded ) vertebrates that do not maintain their kb_human_body kb_temperature through internal kb_physiology processes . their kb_metabolic_rate is low and as kb_a result , their kb_food_industry and kb_energy_industry kb_requirement_analysis are limited . in the adult kb_state_of_matter , they have tear ducts and movable eyelids , and most kb_species have kb_ears that can detect airborne or kb_ground_vibrations vibrations . they have muscular tongues , which in many kb_species can kb_beryllium protruded . kb_modern_history amphibians have fully kb_ossification vertebrae with kb_articular_processes processes . their ribs are usually short and may kb_beryllium fused to the vertebrae . their skulls are mostly broad and short , and are often incompletely kb_ossification . their kb_skin contains little kb_keratin and lacks kb_fish_scale , apart from kb_a few fish-like kb_fish_scale in certain caecilians . the kb_skin contains many mucous glands and in some kb_species , kb_skin ( kb_a kb_type_(biology) of granular kb_gland ) . the hearts of amphibians have kb_triliteral kb_bicameralism , kb_2_(number) kb_atrium_(heart) and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_ventricle_(heart) . they have kb_a kb_urinary_bladder kb_bladder and kb_metabolic_waste#nitrogen_wastes waste products are excreted primarily as kb_urea . most amphibians lay their kb_eggs_as_food in kb_water and have kb_aquatic_plant kb_larvae that undergo kb_metamorphosis to become kb_terrestrial_animal adults . amphibians breathe by means of kb_a pump action in which kb_air_(classical_element) is kb_first_trimester kb_drawing_(metalworking) into the kb_buccopharyngeal_membrane kb_region through the nostrils . these are then closed and the kb_air_(classical_element) is forced into the kb_artificial_lung by kb_contraction_(grammar) of the throat . they supplement this with kb_gas_exchangethe kb_order_(biology) kb_anura_(frog) ( from the kb_ancient_greek `` kb_a ( kb_neutron ) - kb_seed_coat are known as toads . the difference is not kb_a formal kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) taxonomically and there are numerous kb_non-linear_writing to this rule . members of the kb_family_(biology) kb_bufonidae are known as the `` kb_truth toads '' . frogs range in size from the kb_goliath_frog kb_frog ( `` conraua goliath '' ) of kb_west_africa to the `` kb_paedophryne_amauensis amauensis '' , kb_first_trimester described in kb_papua_new_guinea kb_new_guinea in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2012 , which is also the smallest known kb_vertebrate . although most kb_species are associated with kb_water and damp habitats , some are specialised to live in kb_trees or in deserts . they are found worldwide except for kb_polar_molecule areas .kb_anura_(frog) is divided into kb_triliteral suborders that are broadly kb_acceptance#self_acceptance by the kb_scientific_community , but the relationships between some kb_family_(biology) remain unclear . future kb_molecular_genetics studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships . the suborder kb_archaeobatrachia contains four kb_family_(biology) of kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) frogs . these are kb_ascaphidae , kb_bombinatoridae , kb_discoglossidae and kb_leiopelmatidae which have few kb_derived_trait features and are probably kb_paraphyly with regard to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_frog kb_lineage_(anthropology) . the six kb_family_(biology) in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder kb_mesobatrachia are the kb_fossorial kb_megophryidae , kb_pelobatidae , kb_pelodytidae , kb_scaphiopodidae and kb_rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily kb_aquatic_plant kb_pipidae . these have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the kb_2_(number) kb_other_(philosophy) suborders . kb_neobatrachiathe kb_order_(biology) kb_caudata ( from the kb_latin `` cauda '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_tail '' ) consists of the salamanders—elongated , low-slung kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing that mostly resemble kb_lizards in kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . this is kb_a kb_symplesiomorphy kb_trait_theory and they are no more closely related to kb_lizards than they are to mammals . salamanders lack claws , have scale-free kb_seed_coat , either smooth or covered with tubercles , and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned . they range in size from the kb_chinese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias davidianus '' ) , which has been reported to grow to kb_a kb_length of , to the diminutive `` kb_thorius_pennatulus pennatulus '' from kb_mexico which seldom exceeds in kb_length . salamanders have kb_a mostly laurasian distribution , kb_being present in much of the kb_holarctic kb_region of the kb_northern_hemisphere . the kb_family_(biology) kb_plethodontidae is also found in kb_central_america and kb_south_america kb_north of the kb_amazon_basin ; kb_south_america was apparently invaded from kb_central_america by about the start of the kb_miocene , 23 million years ago . kb_urodela is kb_a kb_toponymy sometimes used for all the kb_extant_taxon kb_species of salamanders . members of several kb_salamander kb_family_(biology) have become kb_neotenythe

kb_species , the kb_chinese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias davidianus '' ) , the kb_japanese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias japonicus '' ) and the kb_hellbender ( `` cryptobranchus alleganiensis '' ) from kb_north_america . these kb_prespa_lake amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult kb_state_of_matter ; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded . kb_a unique kb_i_shot_andy_warhol is their ability to kb_animal_feed by suction , depressing either the kb_left-wing_politics side of their lower kb_jaw or the kb_right-wing_politics . the males excavate nests , persuade females to lay their egg kb_string_section inside them , and guard them . as kb_water_well as breathing with kb_artificial_lung , they respire through the many kb_fold_(geology) in their thin kb_skin , which has kb_capillary close to the kb_surface_(topology) .the suborder kb_salamandroidea contains the advanced salamanders . they differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused kb_mandible kb_bones_(studio) in the lower kb_jaw , and by using internal fertilisation . in salamandrids , the kb_male kb_deposit_(geology) kb_a bundle of kb_sperm , the kb_spermatophore , and the female picks kb_it up and inserts kb_it into her kb_cloaca where the kb_sperm is stored until the kb_eggs_as_food are laid . the kb_largest_organisms kb_family_(biology) in this kb_group_(periodic_table) is kb_plethodontidae , the lungless salamanders , which includes 60 % of all kb_salamander kb_species . the kb_family_(biology) kb_salamandridae includes the kb_truth salamanders and the kb_toponymy `` kb_newt '' is given to members of its kb_subfamily kb_pleurodelinae .the kb_ipad_(third_generation) suborder , kb_sirenoidea , contains the four kb_species of kb_siren_(genus) , which are in kb_a kb_single_bond kb_family_(biology) , kb_sirenidae . members of this kb_order_(biology) are eel-like kb_aquatic_plant salamanders with much kb_redox forelimbs and no hind kb_limb_(anatomy) . some of their features are kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) while others are kb_derived_trait . fertilisation is likely to kb_beryllium kb_external_fertilization as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by kb_male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecaethe kb_order_(biology) kb_gymnophiona ( from the kb_ancient_greek `` gymnos '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` naked '' and `` ophis '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` serpent '' ) or kb_caecilian ( from the kb_latin `` an- '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` without '' and the kb_ancient_greek `` poda '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_human_leg '' ) comprises the caecilians . these are kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , cylindrical , limbless kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing with kb_a snake- or kb_annelid kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . the adults vary in kb_length from kb_group_8_element to 75 centimetres ( 3 to 30 inches ) with the exception of kb_thomas_thomson_(chemist) 's kb_caecilian ( `` caecilia thompsoni '' ) , which can reach . kb_a kb_caecilian 's kb_skin has kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of kb_transverse_wave kb_fold_(geology) and in some kb_species contains tiny kb_embedded_system dermal kb_fish_scale . kb_it has rudimentary eyes covered in kb_skin , which are probably limited to discerning differences in kb_light intensity . kb_it also has kb_a pair of short tentacles near the kb_human_eye that can kb_beryllium extended and which have kb_somatosensory_system and kb_olfaction functions . most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp kb_soil , in rotten kb_wood and under kb_plant debris , but some are kb_aquatic_plant . most kb_species lay their kb_eggs_as_food underground and when the kb_larvae hatch , they make their way to adjacent bodies of kb_water . others brood their kb_eggs_as_food and the kb_larvae undergo kb_metamorphosis before the kb_eggs_as_food hatch . kb_a few kb_species give birth to live kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the kb_oviduct . caecilians have kb_a mostly gondwanan kb_structure contains some typical characteristics common to kb_terrestrial_animal vertebrates , such as the presence of highly kb_keratin#cornification outer layers , renewed periodically through kb_a moulting process controlled by the kb_pituitary_gland and kb_thyroid glands . local thickenings ( often called warts ) are common , such as those found on toads . the outside of the kb_skin is shed periodically mostly in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) piece , in kb_contrast_(vision) to mammals and kb_birds where kb_it is shed in kb_lithic_flake . amphibians often kb_eat_(film) the sloughed kb_skin . caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal kb_fish_scale kb_embedded_system in the kb_dermis between the furrows in the kb_skin . the similarity of these to the kb_fish_scale of kb_bony_fish kb_fish is largely superficial . kb_lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony kb_deposit_(geology) in the kb_dermis , but this is an example of kb_convergent_evolutionkb_amphibian kb_skin is permeable to kb_water . kb_gas_exchange can kb_take kb_place_of_articulation through the kb_skin ( kb_cutaneous_respiration respiration ) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the kb_surface_(topology) of kb_water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds . to compensate for their thin and delicate kb_skin , amphibians have kb_evolution_of_tetrapods mucous glands , principally on their heads , backs and tails . the secretions produced by these help keep the kb_skin moist . in kb_addition , most kb_species of kb_amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or kb_poisonous substances . some kb_amphibian toxins can kb_beryllium lethal to humans while others have little effect . the main poison-producing glands , the kb_parotoid_gland , produce the kb_neurotoxin kb_bufotoxin and are located behind the kb_ears of toads , along the backs of frogs , behind the eyes of salamanders and on the kb_upper_egypt kb_surface_(topology) of caecilians .the kb_skin colour of amphibians is produced by kb_triliteral layers of kb_pigment kb_cell_(biology) called chromatophores . these kb_triliteral kb_cell_(biology) layers consist of the melanophores ( occupying the deepest layer ) , the guanophores ( forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules , producing kb_a blue-green colour ) and the lipophores ( yellow , the most superficial layer ) . the colour change displayed by many kb_species is initiated by hormones secreted by the kb_pituitary_gland kb_gland . unlike kb_bony_fish kb_fish , there is no direct control of the kb_pigment kb_cell_(biology) by the kb_nervous_system system , and this results in the colour change taking kb_place_of_articulation more slowly than happens in kb_fish . kb_a vividly coloured kb_skin usually indicates that the kb_species is kb_toxicity and is kb_a warning kb_sign_of_the_pagan to kb_predation .amphibians have kb_a kb_skeleton system that is structurally kb_homology_(chemistry) to kb_other_(philosophy) tetrapods , though with kb_a kb_grammatical_number of variations . they all have four kb_limb_(anatomy) except for the legless caecilians and kb_a few kb_species of kb_salamander with kb_redox or no kb_limb_(anatomy) . the kb_bones_(studio) are hollow and lightweight . the musculoskeletal system is kb_strong_nuclear_force to enable kb_it to support the kb_human_head and kb_human_body . the kb_bones_(studio) are fully kb_ossification and the vertebrae kb_interlock with each kb_other_(philosophy) by means of overlapping processes . the kb_pectoral_girdle girdle is kb_catalyst_support by kb_muscle , and the well-developed kb_pelvic_girdle girdle is attached to the backbone by kb_a pair of sacral ribs . the kb_ilium_(bone)in most amphibians , there are four digits on the fore kb_hiking and five on the hind kb_hiking , but no claws on either . some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in kb_appearance_(philosophy) with tiny , stubby kb_human_leg . the kb_siren_(genus) are kb_aquatic_plant salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind kb_limb_(anatomy) . the caecilians are limbless . they kb_burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of kb_muscle kb_contraction_(grammar) moving along the kb_human_body . on the kb_surface_(topology) of the ground or in kb_water they move by undulating their kb_human_body from side to side .in frogs , the hind kb_human_leg are larger than the fore kb_human_leg , especially kb_sulfate in those kb_species that principally move by jumping or swimming . in the walkers and runners the hind kb_limb_(anatomy) are not kb_sulfate kb_prespa_lake , and the burrowers mostly have short kb_limb_(anatomy) and broad bodies . the kb_foot have adaptations for the way of kb_life_(magazine) , with webbing between the toes for swimming , broad kb_adhesive toe pads for climbing , and keratinised tubercles on the hind kb_foot for digging ( frogs usually dig backwards into the kb_soil ) . in most salamanders , the kb_limb_(anatomy) are short and more or less the same kb_length and kb_project at kb_right-wing_politics angles from the kb_human_body . locomotion on kb_albanian_land_force is by kb_walking and the kb_tail often swings from side to side or is used as kb_a prop , particularly when climbing . in their normal gait , only kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) leg is advanced at kb_a kb_time_(magazine) in the manner kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by their ancestors , the kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish . some salamanders in the kb_genus `` kb_aneides '' and certain kb_lungless_salamander climb kb_trees and have kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_limb_(anatomy) , kb_prespa_lake toepads and prehensile tails . in kb_aquatic_plant salamanders and in kb_frog tadpoles , the kb_tail has kb_dorsum_(anatomy) and kb_ventral_fin kb_fish_fin and is moved from side to side as kb_a means of kb_#propulsion . adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones .salamanders use their tails in kb_arms_industry and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in kb_a process known as kb_autotomyamphibians have kb_a juvenile stage and an adult stage , and the circulatory kb_systems_analysis of the kb_2_(number) are distinct . in the juvenile ( or kb_tadpole ) stage , the circulation is similar to that of kb_a kb_fish ; the two-chambered kb_heart pumps the blood through the gills where kb_it is oxygenated , and is kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) around the kb_human_body and back to the kb_heart in kb_a kb_single_bond loop . in the adult stage , amphibians ( especially frogs ) lose their gills and develop kb_artificial_lung . they have kb_a kb_heart that consists of kb_a kb_single_bond kb_ventricle_(heart) and kb_2_(number) kb_atrium_(heart) . when the kb_ventricle_(heart) starts contracting , deoxygenated blood is pumped through the kb_pulmonary_artery artery to the kb_artificial_lung . continued kb_contraction_(grammar) then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the kb_human_body . mixing of the kb_2_(number) bloodstreams is minimized by the kb_comparative_anatomy of the kb_bicameralism .the kb_nervous_system system is basically the same as in kb_other_(philosophy) vertebrates , with kb_a kb_central_europe kb_brain , kb_a kb_spinal_cord cord , and nerves throughout the kb_human_body . the kb_amphibian kb_brain is less kb_water_well kb_adaptation than that of reptiles , kb_birds and mammals but is similar in kb_morphology_(linguistics) and kb_function_(biology) to that of kb_a kb_fish . kb_it is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving kb_pain_in_amphibians . the kb_brain consists of equal parts , kb_cerebrum , kb_midbrain and kb_cerebellum . various parts of the kb_cerebrum process kb_sensory_system input , such as smell in the kb_olfactory_bulb and sight in the optic lobe , and kb_it is additionally the centre of behaviour and kb_learning . the kb_cerebellum is the center of muscular kb_motor_coordination and the kb_medulla_oblongata controls some kb_organ_(music) functions including heartbeat and respiration . the kb_brain sends signals through the kb_spinal_cord cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the kb_human_body . the kb_pineal_body kb_human_body , known to regulate kb_sleep_(1963_film) patterns in humans , is thought to produce the hormones involved in kb_hibernation and kb_aestivation in amphibians .tadpoles retain the kb_lateral_line_system system of their ancestral fishes , but this is kb_lost_film in kb_terrestrial_animal adult amphibians . some caecilians possess kb_electroreception that allow them to locate kb_object_relations_theory around them when submerged in kb_water . the kb_ears are kb_water_well kb_adaptation in frogs . there is no kb_external_fertilization kb_ear , but the kb_prespa_lake circular kb_tympanum_(anatomy) lies on the kb_surface_(topology) of the kb_human_head just behind the kb_human_eye . this vibrates and kb_sound is transmitted through kb_a kb_single_bond kb_bone , the kb_stapes , to the kb_inner_ear kb_ear . only high-frequency sounds like kb_mating calls are heard in this way , but low-frequency noises can kb_beryllium kb_discovery_of_the_chemical_elements through another kb_mechanism_(biology) . there is kb_a patch of specialized haircells , called `` papilla amphibiorum '' , in the kb_inner_ear kb_ear capable of detecting deeper sounds . another kb_i_shot_andy_warhol , unique to frogs and salamanders , is the columella-operculum kb_complex_number adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the kb_transmission_coefficient of both airborne and seismic signals . the kb_ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly kb_adaptation than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each kb_other_(philosophy) through the kb_list_of_art_mediums of kb_sound .the eyes of tadpoles lack lids , but at kb_metamorphosis , the kb_cornea becomes more dome-shaped , the kb_lens_(anatomy) becomes flatter , and eyelidsmany amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with kb_a sticky tip and drawing kb_it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws . some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey , repeatedly kb_thrust_fault their kb_human_head forward sharply causing the kb_food_industry to move backwards in their mouth by kb_inertia . most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing kb_sulfate they possess voluminous stomachs . the short kb_esophagus is lined with kb_cilium that help to move the kb_food_industry to the kb_stomach and kb_mucus produced by glands in the mouth and kb_pharynx eases its passage . the kb_enzyme kb_chitinase produced in the kb_stomach helps kb_digest_(roman_law) the chitinous kb_cuticle of kb_arthropod prey .amphibians possess kb_a kb_pancreas , kb_liver and kb_gall_bladder kb_bladder . the kb_liver is usually kb_prespa_lake with kb_2_(number) lobes . its size is determined by its kb_function_(biology) as kb_a kb_glycogen and kb_fat storage kb_units_of_measurement , and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up . kb_adipose_tissue kb_tissue_(biology) is another important means of storing kb_energy_industry and this occurs in the kb_abdomen ( in internal kb_structural_analysis called kb_fat bodies ) , under the kb_skin and , in some salamanders , in the kb_tail .there are kb_2_(number) kb_kidneysthe kb_artificial_lung in amphibians are kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) compared to those of amniotes , possessing few internal kb_alveolar_septum and kb_prespa_lake kb_pulmonary_alveolus , and consequently having kb_a comparatively slow kb_diffusion rate for kb_oxygen entering the blood . ventilation is accomplished by kb_buccal_pumping pumping . most amphibians , however , are able to exchange gases with the kb_water or kb_air_(classical_element) via their kb_skin . to enable sufficient kb_cutaneous_respiration respiration , the kb_surface_(topology) of their highly vascularised kb_skin must remain moist to allow the kb_oxygen to diffuse at kb_a sufficiently kb_high_middle_ages rate . because kb_oxygen kb_concentration in the kb_water increases at both low temperatures and kb_high_middle_ages kb_flow_(psychology) kb_rates_(tax) , kb_aquatic_plant amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on kb_cutaneous_respiration respiration , as in the kb_telmatobius_culeus kb_water kb_frog and the kb_cryptobranchus . in kb_air_(classical_element) , where kb_oxygen is more concentrated , some small kb_species can rely solely on cutaneous kb_gas_exchange , most famously the kb_plethodontidae , which have neither kb_artificial_lung nor gills . many kb_aquatic_plant salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage , with some ( such as the kb_axolotlfor the purpose of kb_biological_reproduction most amphibians require kb_fresh_water kb_water although some lay their kb_eggs_as_food on kb_albanian_land_force and have kb_adaptation various means of keeping them moist . kb_a few ( e.g . `` kb_fejervarya_raja raja '' ) can inhabit kb_brackish_water kb_water , but there are no kb_truth kb_ocean amphibians . there are reports , however , of kb_particular kb_amphibian populations unexpectedly invading kb_ocean waters . such was the case with the kb_black_sea invasion of the kb_natural_number kb_hybrid_(biology) `` kb_pelophylax_esculentus esculentus '' reported in 2010 .several hundred kb_frog kb_species in adaptive radiations ( e.g. , `` kb_eleutherodactylus '' , the kb_pacific_ocean `` kb_platymantis '' , the australo-papuan microhylids , and many kb_other_(philosophy) kb_tropical frogs ) , however , do not need any kb_water for kb_breeding_in_the_wild in the kb_wildlife . they reproduce via direct development , an ecological and evolutionary kb_adaptation that has allowed them to kb_beryllium completely independent from free-standing kb_water . kb_almost_all all of these frogs live in wet kb_tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests and their kb_eggs_as_food hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult , passing through the kb_tadpole stage within the egg . reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the kb_quantity of rainfall , but the seasonal timing .in the tropics , many amphibians kb_breed continuously or at any kb_time_(magazine) of year . in kb_temperate_climate kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey , breeding is mostly seasonal , usually in the kb_castalian_spring , and is triggered by increasing day kb_length , rising temperatures or rainfall . experiments have shown the importance of kb_temperature , but the trigger event , especially in kb_arid kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey , is often kb_a storm . in anurans , males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal kb_greek_chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active .in caecilians , fertilisation is internal , the kb_male extruding an kb_intromittent_organ kb_organ_(music) , the phallodeum , and inserting kb_it into the female kb_cloaca . the paired müllerian glands inside the kb_male kb_cloaca secrete kb_a kb_fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian kb_prostate glands and which may kb_transport and nourish the kb_sperm . fertilisation probably takes kb_place_of_articulation in the kb_oviduct .the majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation . in most of these , the kb_male kb_deposit_(geology) kb_a kb_spermatophore , kb_a small packet of kb_sperm on top of kb_a gelatinous kb_conical_surface , on the kb_substratum either on kb_albanian_land_force or in the kb_water . the female takes up the kb_sperm packet by grasping kb_it with the lips of the kb_cloaca and pushing kb_it into the vent . the spermatozoa move to the kb_spermatheca in the roof of the kb_cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may kb_beryllium many months later . courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the kb_spermatophore vary between kb_species . in some , the kb_spermatophore may kb_beryllium placed directly into the female kb_cloaca while in others , the female may kb_beryllium guided to the kb_spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called kb_amplexus . certain kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) salamanders in the kb_family_(biology) kb_sirenidae , kb_hynobiidae and kb_cryptobranchidae practice kb_external_fertilization fertilisation in kb_a similar manner to frogs , with the female laying the kb_eggs_as_food in kb_water and the kb_male releasing kb_sperm onto the egg kb_mass_(liturgy) .with kb_a few kb_non-linear_writing , frogs use kb_external_fertilization fertilisation . the kb_male grasps the female tightly with kb_histidine forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back kb_human_leg , or in the case of `` kb_epipedobates_tricolor tricolor '' , around the kb_neck . they remain in kb_amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the kb_eggs_as_food and the kb_male kb_cover_version them with kb_sperm . roughened nuptial pads on the kb_male 's hands kb_aid in retaining grip . often the kb_male collects and retains the egg kb_mass_(liturgy) , forming kb_a sort of basket with the hind kb_foot . an exception is the kb_granular_poison_frog kb_poison kb_frog ( `` oophaga granulifera '' ) where the kb_male and female kb_place_of_articulation their cloacae in close kb_principles_of_grouping while facing in kb_phyllotaxis directions and then release kb_eggs_as_food and kb_sperm simultaneously . the kb_tailed_frog kb_frog ( `` ascaphus truei '' ) exhibits internal fertilisation . the `` kb_tail '' is only possessed by the kb_male and is an kb_extension_(kinesiology) of the kb_cloaca and used to inseminate the female . this kb_frog lives in fast-flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the kb_sperm from kb_being washed away before fertilisation occurs . the kb_sperm may kb_beryllium retained in storage tubes attached to the kb_oviductthere is kb_a direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts , with elaborate courtship displays to keep the female 's attention kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) enough to get her interested in choosing him to kb_mating with . some kb_species store kb_sperm through kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) breeding seasons , as the kb_extra_(australian_tv_channel) kb_time_(magazine) may allow for kb_interaction_(statistics) with rival kb_sperm .most amphibians kb_go_(game) through kb_metamorphosis , kb_a process of significant kb_morphology_(linguistics) change after birth . in typical kb_amphibian development , kb_eggs_as_food are laid in kb_water and kb_larvae are adapted to an kb_aquatic_plant kb_lifestyle_(sociology) . frogs , toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as kb_larvae with kb_external_fertilization gills . kb_metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by kb_thyroxine kb_concentration in the blood , which stimulates kb_metamorphosis , and kb_prolactin , which counteracts kb_thyroxine 's effect . specific events are dependent on kb_threshold_potential values for different kb_tissue_(biology) . because most kb_embryogenesis is outside the parental kb_human_body , kb_it is kb_grammatical_subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of kb_tooth , whisker-like kb_skin extensions or kb_fish_fin . they also make use of kb_a kb_sensory_system kb_lateral_line kb_line_(geometry) kb_organ_(music) similar to that of kb_fish . after kb_metamorphosis , these kb_organ_(anatomy) become redundant and kb_will_and_testament kb_beryllium reabsorbed by controlled kb_cell_(biology) kb_death , called kb_apoptosisthe egg of an kb_amphibian is typically surrounded by kb_a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides . this capsule is permeable to kb_water and gases , and swells considerably as kb_it absorbs kb_water . the ovum is at kb_first_trimester rigidly held , but in fertilised kb_eggs_as_food the innermost layer liquefies and allows the kb_embryo to move freely . this also happens in kb_salamander kb_eggs_as_food , even when they are unfertilised . kb_eggs_as_food of some salamanders and frogs contain kb_unicellular_organism kb_green_algae . these penetrate the jelly kb_envelope_(waves) after the kb_eggs_as_food are laid and may increase the supply of kb_oxygen to the kb_embryo through kb_photosynthesis . they seem to both speed up the development of the kb_larvae and reduce mortality . most kb_eggs_as_food contain the kb_pigment kb_melanin which raises their kb_temperature through the absorption of kb_light and also protects them against kb_ultraviolet_radiation . caecilians , some kb_plethodontidae and certain frogs lay kb_eggs_as_food underground that are unpigmented . in the kb_wood_frog ( `` rana sylvatica '' ) , the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to kb_beryllium up to warmer than its surroundings , which is an advantage in its cool kb_northern_hemisphere kb_habitat .the kb_eggs_as_food may kb_beryllium deposited singly or in small kb_group_(mathematics) , or may kb_take the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of spherical egg masses , rafts or kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_string_section . in kb_terrestrial_animal caecilians , the kb_eggs_as_food are laid in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams . the amphibious kb_salamander `` kb_ensatina '' attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and kb_semitic_root . the kb_eleutherodactylus_planirostris ( `` kb_eleutherodactylus planirostris '' ) lays kb_eggs_as_food in small kb_group_(mathematics) in the kb_soil where they develop in about kb_2_(number) weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage . the kb_tungara_frog kb_frog ( `` physalaemus pustulosus '' ) builds kb_a floating nest from foam to protect its kb_eggs_as_food . kb_first_trimester kb_a raft is built , then kb_eggs_as_food are laid in the centre , and finally kb_a foam cap is overlaid . the foam has anti-microbial kb_chemical_property . kb_it contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectinsthe kb_eggs_as_food of amphibians are typically laid in kb_water and hatch into free-living kb_larvae that complete their development in kb_water and later transform into either kb_aquatic_plant or kb_terrestrial_animal adults . in many kb_species of kb_frog and in most lungless salamanders ( kb_plethodontidae ) , direct development takes kb_place_of_articulation , the kb_larvae growing within the kb_eggs_as_food and emerging as miniature adults . many caecilians and some kb_other_(philosophy) amphibians lay their kb_eggs_as_food on kb_albanian_land_force , and the newly hatched kb_larvae wriggle or are transported to kb_water bodies . some caecilians , the kb_alpine_salamander ( `` salamandra atra '' ) and some of the kb_nectophrynoides toads ( `` nectophrynoides spp . '' ) are kb_viviparity . their kb_larvae kb_animal_feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female 's kb_oviduct , often for kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) periods . kb_other_(philosophy) amphibians , but not caecilians , are kb_ovoviviparous . the kb_eggs_as_food are retained in or on the parent 's kb_human_body , but the kb_larvae subsist on the yolks of their kb_eggs_as_food and receive no nourishment from the adult . the kb_larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth , either before or after kb_metamorphosis , according to their kb_species . the toad kb_genus `` nectophrynoides '' exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or kb_sulfate members .kb_frog kb_larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , kb_vertical_direction flattened tails with kb_fish_fin . the free-living kb_larvae are normally fully kb_aquatic_plant , but the tadpoles of some kb_species ( such as `` kb_nannophrys_ceylonensis ceylonensis '' ) are semi-terrestrial and live among wet kb_rock_(geology) . tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons , gills for respiration ( kb_external_fertilization gills at kb_first_trimester , internal gills later ) , kb_lateral_line kb_line_(geometry) kb_systems_analysis and kb_prespa_lake tails that they use for swimming . newly hatched tadpoles soon develop kb_gill pouches that cover the gills . the kb_artificial_lung develop early and are used as accessory breathing kb_organ_(anatomy) , the tadpoles rising to the kb_water kb_surface_(topology) to gulp kb_air_(classical_element) . some kb_species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs . these kb_larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of kb_skin through which respiration takes kb_place_of_articulation . while tadpoles do not have kb_truth kb_tooth , in most kb_species , the jaws have kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , parallel rows of small kb_keratinized kb_structural_analysis called keradonts surrounded by kb_a horny beak . front kb_human_leg are formed under the kb_gill sac and hind kb_human_leg become visible kb_a few days later .kb_iodine and t4 ( over stimulate the spectacular kb_apoptosis [ programmed kb_cell_(biology) kb_death ] of the kb_cell_(biology) of the larval gills , kb_tail and kb_fish_fin ) also stimulate the kb_evolution_of_nervous_systems kb_nervous_systems kb_systems_analysis transforming the kb_aquatic_plant , vegetarian kb_tadpole into the

although kb_wind and kb_hydroelectricity kb_power_(physics) are abundant and underdeveloped , proposals for statewide kb_energy_industry kb_systems_analysis ( e.g . with special kb_single-wire_earth_return#use_in_interties electric interties ) were judged uneconomical ( at the kb_time_(magazine) of the report , 2001 ) due to low ( less than 50¢/gal ) kb_fuel prices , kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) distances and low kb_population . the cost of kb_a gallon of kb_gas in kb_urban_area kb_alaska today is usually 30–60¢ higher than the national average ; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on kb_transportation costs , seasonal usage peaks , nearby kb_petroleum development kb_infrastructure and many

kb_a surplus in kb_state_of_matter kb_petroleum revenues from kb_palm_oil , largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed kb_trans-alaska_pipeline_system pipeline system . the fund was originally kb_anatolian_hypothesis by kb_governor_(united_states) kb_keith_harvey_miller miller on the kb_eve of the 1969 prudhoe bay lease sale , out of kb_fear that the kb_alabama_legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale ( which amounted to kb_usd 900 million ) at once . kb_it was later championed by kb_governor_(united_states) kb_jay_hammond hammond and kb_kenai,_alaska kb_alaska_house_of_representatives hugh malone . kb_it has served as an attractive kb_politics prospect ever since , diverting revenues which would normally kb_beryllium deposited into the kb_general_(united_states) fund .the kb_alaska_constitution was written kb_sulfate as to discourage dedicating kb_state_of_matter funds for kb_a kb_particular purpose . the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this , mostly due to the kb_politics kb_climate_of_albania of distrust existing during the kb_time_(magazine) of its creation . from its initial principal of kb_usd 734,000 , the fund has grown to kb_usd 50 kb_billion as kb_a result of kb_palm_oil royalties and kb_list_of_australian_capital_cities investment programs . most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside kb_alaska . this has kb_light-emitting_diode to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within kb_alaska , though such kb_a stance has never gained kb_momentum .starting in kb_1982_world_rally_championship_season , dividends from the fund 's kb_annual_plant growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans , ranging from an initial kb_usd 1,000 in kb_1982_world_rally_championship_season ( equal to kb_triliteral years ' payout , as the distribution of payments was held up in kb_a lawsuit over the distribution scheme ) to kb_usd 3,269 in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 ( which included kb_a one-time kb_usd 1,200 `` resource rebate '' ) . every year , the kb_state_of_matter kb_alabama_legislature takes out kb_group_8_element % from the earnings , puts 3 % back into the principal for kb_inflation proofing , and the remaining 5 % is distributed to all qualifying alaskans . to qualify for the permanent fund kb_dividend , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) must have lived in the kb_state_of_matter for kb_a kb_minimum of 12 months , maintain constant residency kb_grammatical_subject to allowable absences , and not

compared to 17 % nationwide . the kb_peony kb_industry has also taken off , as the kb_growing_season kb_season allows farmers to kb_harvest during kb_a gap in supply elsewhere in the kb_world_war_ii , thereby filling kb_a niche in the kb_flower market .kb_alaska , with no kb_county_(united_states) , lacks county fairs . however , kb_a small assortment of kb_state_of_matter and local fairs ( with the kb_alaska_state_fair fair in kb_palmer,_alaska the kb_largest_organisms ) , are held mostly in the late summer . the fairs are mostly located in communities with kb_historic_site or

with spurs to kb_whittier,_alaska , kb_palmer,_alaska and kb_north_pole . the cities , towns , villages , and kb_region served by arr tracks are known statewide as `` the railbelt '' . in recent years , the ever-improving kb_road_surface highway system began to kb_eclipse the railroad 's importance in kb_alaska 's kb_economy_of_alaska .the railroad played kb_a vital role in kb_alaska 's development , moving kb_cargo into kb_alaska while transporting kb_natural_resources southward ( i.e. , kb_coal from the usibelli kb_coal mine near kb_healy,_alaska to kb_seward,_alaska and kb_gravel from the kb_matanuska_valley kb_valley to kb_anchorage,_alaska ) . kb_it is kb_water_well known for its summertime tour passenger service .the kb_alaska_railroad was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the last railroads in kb_north_america to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some kb_gravel trains . kb_it continues to offer kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the last kb_request_stop routes in the kb_country_music . kb_a stretch of about of track along an kb_area kb_north of kb_talkeetna,_alaska remains inaccessible by road ; the railroad provides the only kb_transportation to rural homes and cabins in the kb_area . until kb_construction of the parks highway in the 1970s , the railroad provided the only kb_albanian_land_force access to most of the kb_region along its entire route .in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_southeast_alaska , the kb_white_pass_and_yukon_route and kb_yukon route also partly runs through the kb_state_of_matter from kb_skagway,_alaska northwards into kb_canada ( kb_british_columbia and kb_yukon ) , crossing the kb_border_crossings_of_albania at kb_white_american pass summit . this kb_line_(geometry) is now mainly used by tourists , often arriving

737-400s ) from kb_anchorage,_alaska and kb_fairbanks,_alaska to kb_regional_power hubs like kb_bethel,_alaska , kb_nome,_alaska , kb_kotzebue,_alaska , kb_dillingham,_alaska , kb_kodiak_island_borough,_alaskathe bulk of remaining commercial kb_flight offerings come from small kb_regional_power commuter airlines such as kb_ravn_alaska kb_alaska , kb_penair , and kb_frontier_flying_service service . the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered kb_the_bush_(alaska) flying kb_service_(economics) using kb_general_aviation kb_aircraft such as the kb_cessna_caravan caravan , the most popular kb_aircraft in use in the kb_state_of_matter . much of this service can kb_beryllium attributed to the kb_alaska bypass kb_airmail kb_program_(computing) which subsidizes bulk kb_airmail kb_childbirth to alaskan rural communities . the kb_program_(computing) requires 70 % of that kb_subsidy to kb_goto_(command) carriers kb_world_health_organization offer passenger service to the communities .many communities have small kb_air_(classical_element) taxi kb_service_(economics) . these operations originated from the demand for customized kb_transport to remote areas . perhaps the most quintessentially alaskan kb_plane_(geometry) is kb_the_bush_(alaska) kb_the_bush_(alaska) kb_seaplane . the kb_world_war_ii 's

official kb_distance is kb_set_(mythology) at ) . the kb_race_(human_categorization) commemorates the famous kb_1925_serum_run_to_nome serum run to kb_nome,_alaska in which mushers and dogs like kb_togo and kb_balto took much-needed kb_medicine to the diphtheria-stricken kb_community of kb_nome,_alaska when all kb_other_(philosophy) means of kb_transportation had failed . mushers from all

yield farming , kb_a view exemplified by kb_a quote heading the center for kb_globalization kb_food_industry issues website : 'growing more per kb_acre kb_leaf more kb_albanian_land_force for

kb_good_agricultural_practices agronomic practices such as kb_crop_rotation . the kb_push–pull_agricultural_pest_management kb_agriculture pest kb_managementkb_global_warming and kb_agriculture are

more sustainable . kb_technology permits innovations like kb_conservation_tillagesince the kb_1940s , kb_agricultural_productivity has increased dramatically , due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive kb_mechanized_farming , kb_fertilizers and kb_pesticides . the vast majority of this kb_energy_industry input comes from kb_fossil_fuel sources . between the kb_1960s_in_the_united_states and the 1980s , the kb_green_revolution transformed kb_agriculture around kb_the_globe_(toronto_newspaper) globe , with kb_world_war_ii kb_cereal production increasing significantly ( between 70 % and 390 % for kb_wheat and 60 % to 150 % for kb_rice , depending on geographic kb_area ) as kb_world_population doubled . heavy reliance on kb_petrochemicals has raised concerns that kb_palm_oil shortages could increase costs and reduce kb_agriculture output .industrialized kb_agriculture depends on kb_fossil fuels in kb_2_(number) fundamental ways : direct consumption on the kb_farm and manufacture of inputs used on the kb_farm . direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate kb_farm vehicles and kb_machinery .indirect consumption includes the manufacture of kb_fertilizers , kb_pesticides , and kb_farm kb_machinery . in kb_particular , the production of kb_nitrogen_fertilizer can account for over half of kb_agriculture kb_energy_industry usage . together , direct and indirect consumption by kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) farms accounts for about kb_alkaline_earth_metal % of kb_the_nation nation 's kb_energy_industry use . direct and indirect kb_energy_industry consumption by kb_united_states_navy farms peaked in 1979 , and has since gradually declined . kb_food_systems encompass not just kb_agriculture but off-farm kb_fish_processing , packaging , transporting , marketing , consumption , and disposal of kb_food_industry and food-related items . kb_agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of kb_food_industry system kb_energy_industry use in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) .kb_agriculture kb_economics refers to kb_economics as kb_it relates to the `` production , distribution and consumption of [ kb_agriculture ] goods and kb_service_(economics) '' . combining kb_agricultural_sector with kb_general_(united_states) kb_theories of marketing and kb_business as kb_a discipline of kb_science began in the late 1800s , and grew significantly through the 20th century . although the kb_science of kb_agriculture kb_economics is relatively recent , kb_major_(united_states) trends in kb_agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout kb_history , ranging from tenant farmers and kb_sharecropping in the post-american kb_american_civil_war kb_war kb_southern_united_states kb_sovereign_state to the kb_european_eel kb_feudal system of kb_manorialism . in the united kb_sovereign_state , and elsewhere , kb_food_industry costs attributed to kb_food_processing , distribution , and kb_agricultural_marketing , sometimes referred to as the kb_agricultural_value_chain , have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined . this is related to the greater kb_efficiency of farming , combined with the increased level of kb_value_added ( e.g . more highly processed products ) provided by the supply chain . kb_market_concentration kb_concentration has increased in the sector as kb_water_well , and although the total effect of the increased kb_market_concentration kb_concentration is likely increased kb_efficiency , the changes redistribute kb_economic_surplusnational kb_government_of_angola policies can significantly change the kb_economic_anthropology kb_market_(economics) for kb_agriculture products , in the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_taxation , kb_subsidy , tariffs and kb_other_(philosophy) measures . since at least the kb_1960s_in_the_united_states , kb_a combination of kb_trade restrictions , kb_exchange_rate_policy rate policies and kb_subsidy have affected farmers in both the developing and the kb_developed_world . in the 1980s , non-subsidized farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low kb_globalization prices for kb_farm products . between the mid-1980s and the early kb_2000s_in_angola , several international agreements limited kb_agriculture tariffs , kb_subsidy and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_trade restrictions .however , , there was still kb_a significant amount of policy-driven kb_distortion in kb_globalization kb_agriculture kb_decay_product prices . the kb_triliteral kb_agriculture products with the greatest amount of kb_trade kb_distortion were kb_sugar , kb_milk and kb_rice , mainly due to kb_taxation . among the oilseedskb_agricultural_science is kb_a broad multidisciplinary field of kb_biology that encompasses the parts of exact , kb_natural_number

adverse kb_environmental_awareness effects such as kb_soil_retrogression_and_degradation , kb_waste_management kb_management , and kb_bioremediation .the kb_scientific_method kb_science of kb_agriculture began in the kb_18th_century century , when kb_johann_friedrich_mayer_(agriculturist) friedrich mayer conducted experiments on the use of kb_gypsum ( hydrated kb_calcium_sulphate ) as kb_a kb_fertilizer . kb_research became more kb_iupac_nomenclature when in 1843 , kb_john_lawes and kb_henry_gilbert gilbert began kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of long-term kb_agronomy field experiments at

kb_hatch_act_of_1887 act of 1887 provided funding for what kb_it was the kb_first_trimester to call `` kb_agricultural_science '' , driven by farmers ' kb_interest in kb_fertilizers . in kb_agriculture kb_entomology , the kb_united_states_department_of_agriculture began to kb_research kb_biology control in 1881 ; kb_it instituted its kb_first_trimester kb_prespa_lake kb_program_(computing) in 1905 , searching kb_europe and kb_japan for kb_natural_number enemies of the kb_lymantria_dispar_dispar and kb_brown-tail kb_moth , establishing parasitoids ( such as

and imports of foreign kb_agriculture products . governments usually implement kb_agriculture policies with the goal of achieving kb_a specific outcome in the domestic kb_agriculture kb_decay_product kb_market_(economics) . some overarching themes include kb_risk kb_management and adjustment ( including policies related to kb_climate_change , kb_food_safety and kb_natural_number disasters ) , kb_economic_stability ( including policies related to taxes ) , kb_natural_resources and environmental kb_sustainability ( especially kb_water_resource_management ) , kb_research_and_development development , and market access for domestic commodities ( including kb_foreign_relations_of_albania with kb_globalization organizations and agreements with kb_other_(philosophy) countries ) . kb_agricultural_policy can also touch on kb_food_quality , ensuring that the kb_food_industry supply is of kb_a kb_consistent and known quality , kb_food_security , ensuring that the kb_food_industry supply meets the kb_population 's needs , and kb_conservation_biology . policy programs can range from financial programs , such as kb_subsidy , to encouraging producers to enroll in kb_pledge_of_allegiance_(united_states)#legal_challenges quality assurance programs .there are many influences on the creation of kb_agricultural_policy , including consumers , kb_agribusiness ,

'' in kb_histidine kb_letter_(alphabet) to orwell , kb_he_(letter) predicted :kb_thomas_henry_huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the kb_developed_world might make for itself . from these , kb_he_(letter) made some warnings in kb_histidine writings and talks . in kb_a 1958 televised kb_interview_(magazine) conducted by journalist kb_mike_wallace wallace , kb_thomas_henry_huxley outlined several kb_major_(united_states) concerns : the difficulties and dangers of kb_world_war_ii overpopulation ; the tendency toward distinctly kb_hierarchical kb_social_anarchism organisation ; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of kb_technology in kb_mass_(liturgy) kb_society susceptible to persuasion ; the tendency to promote kb_modern_history politicians to kb_a naive kb_state_school as well-marketed commodities .in 1953 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley and maria kb_applied_science for kb_citizenship_in_the_united_states kb_sovereign_state citizenship and presented themselves for kb_hypothesis . when kb_thomas_henry_huxley refused to kb_bear arms for the kb_united_states_navy and would not kb_state_of_matter that kb_histidine objections were based on kb_religion ideals , the only excuse allowed under the kb_mccarran_internal_security_act act , the judge had to adjourn the proceedings . kb_he_(letter) withdrew kb_histidine kb_application_(computing) . nevertheless , kb_he_(letter) remained in the kb_united_states_navy in 1959 kb_thomas_henry_huxley turned down an offer of kb_a kb_knight_bachelor kb_bachelor's_degree by the kb_harold_macmillan#prime_minister_(1957–1963) kb_government_of_angola without putting forward kb_a kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving ; kb_histidine brother kb_julian_(emperor) had been kb_kbe in 1958 , while another brother andrew would kb_beryllium kb_kbe in 1974 .beginning in 1939 and continuing until kb_death_of_alexander_the_great in 1963 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley had an extensive kb_continental_association with the kb_vedanta_society_of_southern_california of kb_southern_europe kb_california , founded and headed by kb_swami_prabhavananda . together with kb_gerald_heard heard , kb_christopher_isherwood isherwood and kb_other_(philosophy) followers , kb_he_(letter) was initiated by the kb_swami and was taught kb_meditation and kb_spirituality practices .in 1944 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley wrote the introduction to the `` kb_bhagavad_gita gita : the song of kb_god '' , translated by kb_swami_prabhavananda and kb_christopher_isherwood isherwood , which was published by the kb_vedanta_society_of_southern_california of kb_southern_europe kb_california .from 1941 until kb_u.s._presidential_election,_1960 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley contributed 48 kb_article_(grammar) to `` kb_vedanta and the kb_western_culture '' , published by the society . kb_he_(letter) also served on the editorial board with isherwood , heard , and kb_playwright kb_john_van_druten druten from kb_1951_in_literature through 1962 .kb_thomas_henry_huxley also occasionally lectured at the kb_hollywood and santa kb_barbara_branden kb_vedanta kb_egyptian_temple . kb_2_(number) of those lectures have been released on cd : `` kb_knowledge_and_understanding understanding '' and `` kb_world_health_organization are we ?

based on kb_plastidkb_carl_linnaeus , in `` kb_species_plantarum '' ( 1753 ) , the starting point for kb_modern_history kb_botanical_nomenclature nomenclature , recognized 14 kb_genus of kb_algae , of which only four are currently considered among kb_algae . in `` kb_10th_edition_of_systema_naturae naturae '' , kb_carl_linnaeus described the kb_genus `` kb_volvox '' and `` kb_corallina '' , and kb_a kb_species of `` kb_acetabularia '' ( as `` kb_madrepora '' ) , among the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing .in 1768 , kb_samuel_gottlieb_gmelin gmelin ( 1744–1774 ) published the `` historia fucorum '' , the kb_first_trimester kb_cold_working dedicated to kb_ocean kb_algae and the kb_first_trimester book on kb_marine_biology to use the then kb_new_world binomial nomenclature of kb_carl_linnaeus . kb_it included elaborate illustrations of kb_seaweed and kb_ocean kb_algae on folded kb_leaf .kb_w.h.harvey ( 1811–1866 ) and kb_lamouroux ( 1813 ) were the kb_first_trimester to divide kb_macroscopic_scale kb_algae into four kb_division_(sport) based on their pigmentation . this is the kb_first_trimester use of kb_a biochemical criterion in kb_plant systematics . harvey 's four kb_division_(sport) are : kb_red_fox kb_algae ( rhodospermae ) , kb_robert_brown_(scottish_botanist_from_montrose) kb_algae ( melanospermae ) , kb_green_algae ( chlorospermae ) , and diatomaceae .at this kb_time_(magazine) , kb_microscopic_scale kb_algae were discovered and reported by kb_a different kb_group_(periodic_table) of workers ( e.g. , kb_otto_friedrich_müller f. müller and kb_christian_gottfried_ehrenberg ) studying the kb_infusoria ( kb_microscopic_scale organisms ) . unlike kb_macroalgae , which were clearly viewed as plants , kb_microalgae were frequently considered kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing because they are often kb_motility . even the nonmotile ( coccoid ) kb_microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the kb_biological_life_cycle of plants , kb_macroalgae , or kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing .although used as kb_a kb_taxonomy_(general) category in some pre-darwinian kb_biological_classification , e.g. , kb_carl_linnaeus ( 1753 ) , kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann jussieu ( 1789 ) , horaninow ( 1843 ) , agassiz ( 1859 ) , wilson & cassin ( 1864 ) , in further kb_biological_classification , the `` kb_algae '' are seen as an artificial , kb_polyphyletic kb_group_(periodic_table) .throughout the 20th century , most kb_biological_classification treated the following kb_group_(mathematics) as kb_division_(sport) or classes of kb_algae : cyanophytes , rhodophytes , chrysophytes , xanthophytes , kb_diatom , phaeophytes , kb_dinoflagellate#history ( kb_cryptomonad and dinophytes ) , euglenophytes , and kb_chlorophyta . later , many kb_new_world kb_group_(mathematics) were discovered ( e.g. , kb_bolidophyceae ) , and others were splintered from older kb_group_(mathematics) : charophytes and glaucophytes ( from kb_chlorophyta ) , many heterokontophytes ( e.g. , kb_synurophyceae from chrysophytes , or eustigmatophytes from xanthophytes ) , haptophytes ( from chrysophytes ) , and chlorarachniophytes ( from xanthophytes ) .with the abandonment of plant-animal dichotomous kb_statistical_classification , most kb_group_(mathematics) of kb_algae ( sometimes all ) were included in protista , later also abandoned in favour of kb_eukaryota . however , as kb_a legacy of the older kb_plant kb_life_(magazine) scheme , some kb_group_(mathematics) that were also treated as protozoans in the kb_past still have duplicated kb_biological_classification ( kb_episcopal_see ambiregnal protists ) .some kb_parasitic kb_algae ( e.g. , the kb_green_algae `` kb_prototheca '' and `` kb_helicosporidium '' , kb_parasites of metazoans , or `` kb_cephaleuros '' , kb_parasites of plants ) were originally classified as kb_fungi , sporozoans , or protistans of `` kb_incertae_sedis sedis '' , while others ( e.g. , the kb_green_algae `` kb_phyllosiphon '' and `` kb_rhodochytrium '' , kb_parasites of plants , or the kb_red_fox kb_algae `` kb_pterocladiophila '' and `` kb_gelidiocolax_mammillatus mammillatus '' , kb_parasites of kb_other_(philosophy) kb_red_fox kb_algae , or the dinoflagellates `` kb_oodinium '' , kb_parasites of kb_fish ) had their relationship with kb_algae conjectured early . in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_noun_case , some kb_group_(mathematics) were originally characterized as kb_parasitic kb_algae ( e.g. , `` kb_chlorochytrium '' ) , but later were seen as kb_endophytic kb_algae . some filamentous kb_bacteria ( e.g. , `` kb_beggiatoa '' ) were originally seen as kb_algae . furthermore , kb_group_(mathematics) like the kb_apicomplexans are also kb_parasites

kb_group_(mathematics) to exhibit three-dimensional kb_multicellular kb_thallus are the kb_red_algae and kb_brown_algae , and some kb_chlorophyta . apical growth is constrained to subsets of these kb_group_(mathematics) : the kb_florideophyceae kb_red_algae , various kb_brown_algae , and the charophytes . the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of charophytes is quite different from those of kb_red_algae and kb_brown_algae , because they have distinct nodes , separated by internode 'stems ' ; whorls of kb_branches_of_science reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes . conceptacles are another kb_polyphyletic kb_trait_theory ; they appear in the kb_coralline_algae kb_algae and the kb_hildenbrandiales , as kb_water_well as the kb_brown_algae .most of the simpler kb_algae are kb_unicellular_organism flagellates or amoeboids , but kb_colonialism and nonmotile kb_theory_of_forms have kb_adaptation independently among several of the kb_group_(mathematics) . some of the more

kb_evolutionary_biology biologist kb_ronald_fisher fisher . in the anova setting , the observed kb_variance in kb_a kb_particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation . in its simplest kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , anova provides kb_a kb_statistical_test of whether the kb_population means of several kb_group_(mathematics) are equal , and therefore generalizes the `` t '' -test to more than kb_2_(number) kb_group_(mathematics) . anova is useful for comparing ( testing ) kb_triliteral or more kb_group_(periodic_table) means for kb_statistical_significance . kb_it is conceptually similar to kb_multiple_comparisons_problem t-tests , but is more kb_conservative , resulting in fewer kb_type_i_errors

kb_set_(mythology) of characteristics of each kb_dog . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) way to do that is to `` explain '' the distribution of weights by dividing the kb_dog kb_population into kb_group_(mathematics) based on those characteristics . kb_a successful grouping kb_will_and_testament split dogs such that ( kb_a ) each kb_group_(periodic_table) has kb_a low kb_variance of kb_dog weights ( kb_meaning_(linguistics) the kb_group_(periodic_table) is relatively homogeneous ) and ( kb_riboflavin ) the kb_mean of each kb_group_(periodic_table) is distinct ( if kb_2_(number) kb_group_(mathematics) have the same kb_mean , then kb_it is n't reasonable to conclude that the kb_group_(mathematics) are , in kb_fact , separate in any meaningful way ) .in the illustrations to the kb_right-wing_politics , kb_group_(mathematics) are kb_interpretatio_graeca as `` x '' , `` x '' , etc . in the kb_first_trimester illustration , the dogs are divided according to the kb_decay_product ( kb_interaction ) of kb_2_(number) kb_binary_number groupings : kb_thomas_young_(scientist) vs kb_old_testament , and short-haired vs long-haired ( e.g. , kb_group_(periodic_table) 1 is kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , short-haired dogs , kb_group_(periodic_table) kb_alkaline_earth_metal is kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , long-haired dogs , etc. ) . since the distributions of kb_dog weight within each of the kb_group_(mathematics) ( shown in blue ) has kb_a relatively kb_prespa_lake kb_variance , and since the means are very similar across kb_group_(mathematics) , grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in kb_dog weights : knowing which kb_group_(periodic_table) kb_a kb_dog is in does n't allow kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) to predict its weight much better than simply knowing the kb_dog is in kb_a kb_dog show . thus , this grouping fails to explain the variation in the overall distribution ( yellow-orange ) .an attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as `` pet vs working kb_breed '' and `` less athletic vs more athletic '' would probably kb_beryllium somewhat more successful ( fair fit ) . the heaviest show dogs are likely to kb_beryllium big , kb_strong_nuclear_force , working breeds , while breeds kept as pets tend to kb_beryllium smaller and thus lighter . as shown by the kb_second_language illustration , the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the kb_first_trimester case , and the means are more distinguishable . however , the significant overlap of distributions , for example , means that we can not distinguish `` x '' and `` x '' reliably . grouping dogs according to kb_a kb_coin flip might produce distributions that kb_look_(american_magazine) similar .an attempt to explain weight by kb_breed is likely to produce kb_a very good fit . all chihuahuas are kb_light and all st bernards are heavy . the difference in weights between setters and kb_pointer_(computer_programming) does not justify separate breeds . the kb_analysis of kb_variance provides the formal tools to justify these kb_intuition_(knowledge) judgments . kb_a common use of the method is the kb_analysis of experimental kb_big_data or the development of models . the method has some advantages over correlation : not all of the kb_big_data must kb_beryllium numeric and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) result of the method is kb_a kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition in the kb_confidence_and_supply in an explanatory relationship .anova is kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_statistical_hypothesis_testing testing heavily used in the kb_analysis of experimental kb_big_data . kb_a test result ( calculated from the kb_null_hypothesis and the kb_sample_(statistics) ) is called kb_statistical_physics significant if kb_it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance , `` assuming the kb_truth of the kb_null_hypothesis '' . kb_a kb_statistical_physics significant result , when kb_a kb_probability ( `` p '' -value ) is less than kb_a pre-specified kb_threshold_potential ( kb_statistical_significance ) , justifies the rejection of the kb_null_hypothesis , but only if the kb_a_priori_and_a_posteriori kb_probability of the kb_null_hypothesis is not kb_high_middle_ages .in the typical kb_application_(computing) of anova , the kb_null_hypothesis is that all kb_group_(mathematics) are random samples from the same kb_population . for example , when studying the effect of different treatments on similar samples of patients , the kb_null_hypothesis would kb_beryllium that all treatments have the same effect ( perhaps kb_none_(liturgy) ) . rejecting the kb_null_hypothesis is taken to kb_mean that the differences in observed effects between treatment kb_group_(mathematics) are unlikely to kb_beryllium due to random chance .by kb_construction , hypothesis testing limits the rate of kb_type_i_errors kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics ( false positives ) to kb_a kb_statistical_significance . experimenters also wish to kb_limit_(mathematics) kb_type_ii_errors kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics ( false negatives ) .the rate of kb_type_ii_errors kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics depends largely on kb_sample_(statistics) size ( the rate is larger for smaller samples ) , kb_importancelevel ( when the standard of proof is kb_high_middle_ages , the chances of overlookingkb_a discovery are also kb_high_middle_ages ) and kb_effect_size size ( kb_a smaller kb_effect_size size is more prone to kb_type_(biology) ii kb_error ) .the terminology of anova is largely from the kb_statistical_mechanicskb_design_of_experiments of experiments . the experimenter adjusts factors andmeasures responses in an attempt to determine an effect . factors areassigned to experimental units by kb_a combination of randomization andkb_randomized_block_design to ensure the kb_validity_(logic) of the results . kb_blind_experiment keeps theweighing impartial . responses show kb_a variability that is partiallythe result of the effect and is partially random kb_error .anova is the synthesis of several kb_idea and kb_it is used for kb_cross-platform_softwarepurposes . as kb_a consequence , kb_it is difficult to define concisely or precisely .`` kb_classical_conditioning '' anova for balanced kb_big_data does kb_triliteral things at once :in short , anova is kb_a kb_statistical_mechanics kb_tool used in several ways to develop and confirm an explanation for the observed kb_big_data .additionally :as kb_a result :anova `` has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) enjoyed the status of kb_being the most used ( some wouldsay abused ) kb_statistical_mechanics technique in kb_psychology kb_research . ''anova `` is probably the most useful technique in the field ofkb_statistical_mechanics inference . ''anova is difficult to teach , particularly for kb_complex_number experiments , with kb_restricted_randomization designs kb_being kb_notorious_(1946_film) . in some kb_noun_case the properkb_application_(computing) of the method is best determined by problem kb_pattern_recognitionfollowed by the consultation of kb_a classic authoritative test .( condensed from the `` kb_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology kb_engineering kb_statistics handbook '' : kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) 5.7. kb_aglossary of doe terminology . )there are kb_triliteral classes of models used in the kb_analysis of kb_variance , and these are outlined here .the fixed-effects kb_rutherford_model ( kb_class_(biology) kb_iodine ) of kb_analysis of kb_variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or more treatments to the kb_british_subject of the kb_experiment to kb_episcopal_see whether the kb_response_variable variable values change . this allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of kb_response_variable variable values that the treatment would generate in the kb_population as kb_a whole .random-effects kb_rutherford_model ( kb_class_(biology) ii ) is used when the treatments are not fixed . this occurs when the various kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors levels are sampled from kb_a larger kb_population . because the levels themselves are random kb_variable_(mathematics) , some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments ( kb_a multi-variable generalization of kb_simple_polygon differences ) differ from the fixed-effects kb_rutherford_model .kb_a mixed-effects kb_rutherford_model ( kb_class_(biology) iii ) contains experimental factors of both fixed and random-effects types , with appropriately different interpretations and kb_analysis for the kb_2_(number) types .example :teaching experiments could kb_beryllium performed by kb_a kb_college or kb_aarhus_university kb_departments_of_franceto find kb_a good introductory textbook , with each text considered kb_atreatment . the fixed-effects kb_rutherford_model would compare kb_a kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of candidatekb_literature . the random-effects kb_rutherford_model would determine whether importantdifferences exist among kb_a kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of randomly selected kb_literature . themixed-effects kb_rutherford_model would compare the ( fixed ) incumbent kb_literature torandomly selected alternatives .kb_definable_set fixed and random effects has proven elusive , with competingdefinitions arguably leading toward kb_a kb_linguistic_anthropology quagmire .the kb_analysis of kb_variance has been studied from several approaches , the most common of which uses kb_a kb_linear_model that relates the response to the treatments and kb_periodic_table_block . note that the kb_rutherford_model is kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history in parameters but may kb_beryllium nonlinear across kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors levels . kb_interpretation_(logic) is easy when kb_big_data is balanced across factors but much deeper understanding is needed for unbalanced kb_big_data .the kb_analysis of kb_variance can kb_beryllium presented in terms of kb_a kb_linear_model , which makes the following assumptions about the kb_probability_distribution of the responses :the separate assumptions of the textbook kb_rutherford_model imply that the kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics are independently , identically , and normally distributed for fixed effects models , that is , that the kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics ( formula_1 ) are independent andin kb_a kb_randomized_controlled_trial controlled kb_experiment , the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units , following the experimental protocol . this randomization is objective and declared before the kb_experiment is carried out . the objective random-assignment is used to test the kb_importance of the kb_null_hypothesis , following the kb_idea of kb_charles_sanders_peirce peirce and kb_ronald_fisher fisher . this design-based kb_analysis was discussed and kb_adaptation by kb_francis_j._anscombe j. anscombe at kb_rothamsted_experimental_station experimental station and by kb_oscar_kempthorne at kb_iowa_state_university kb_aarhus_university . kempthorne and kb_histidine students make an assumption of `` kb_units_of_measurement treatment additivity '' , which is discussed in the books of kempthorne and kb_david_r._cox cox .in its simplest kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , the assumption of unit-treatment additivity kb_sovereign_state that the observed response formula_3 from experimental kb_units_of_measurement formula_4 when receiving treatment formula_5 can kb_beryllium written as the kb_addition of the kb_units_of_measurement 's response formula_6 and the treatment-effect formula_7 , that isthe assumption of unit-treatment additivity implies that , for every treatment formula_5 , the formula_5th treatment has exactly the same effect formula_11 on every kb_experiment kb_units_of_measurement .the assumption of kb_units_of_measurement treatment additivity usually can not kb_beryllium directly kb_falsifiability , according to cox and kempthorne . however , many `` consequences '' of treatment-unit additivity can kb_beryllium kb_falsifiability . for kb_a randomized kb_experiment , the assumption of unit-treatment additivity `` implies '' that the kb_variance is constant for all treatments . therefore , by kb_contraposition , kb_a necessary condition for unit-treatment additivity is that the kb_variance is constant .the use of kb_units_of_measurement treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design-based inference that is standard in finite-population kb_survey_sampling .kempthorne uses the randomization-distribution and the assumption of `` kb_units_of_measurement treatment additivity '' to produce kb_a `` kb_derived_trait kb_linear_model '' , very similar to the textbook kb_rutherford_model discussed previously . the test kb_statistics of this kb_derived_trait kb_linear_model are closely approximated by the test kb_statistics of an appropriate normal kb_linear_model , according to approximation theorems and kb_simulation studies . however , there are differences . for example , the randomization-based kb_analysis results in kb_a small but ( strictly ) kb_negative_number correlation between the kb_observations_(pierre_belon) . in the randomization-based kb_analysis , there is `` no assumption '' of kb_a `` normal '' distribution and certainly `` no assumption '' of `` kb_independence '' . on the contrary , `` the kb_observations_(pierre_belon) are dependent '' !the randomization-based kb_analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious kb_algebra_over_a_field and extensive kb_time_(magazine) . since the randomization-based kb_analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using kb_a normal kb_linear_model , most kb_teachers emphasize the normal kb_linear_model approach . few statisticians kb_space_debris to model-based kb_analysis of balanced randomized experiments .however , when kb_applied_science to kb_big_data from non-randomized experiments or kb_observational_study , model-based kb_analysis lacks the warrant of randomization . for kb_observational_astronomy kb_big_data , the derivation of kb_confidence_and_supply intervals must use `` subjective '' models , as emphasized by kb_ronald_fisher fisher and kb_histidine followers . in practice , the estimates of treatment-effects from kb_observational_study generally are often inconsistent . in practice , `` kb_statistical_mechanics models '' and kb_observational_astronomy kb_big_data are useful for suggesting kb_hypothesis that should kb_beryllium treated very cautiously by the kb_state_school .the normal-model based anova kb_analysis assumes the kb_independence , normality andhomogeneity of variances of the residuals . therandomization-based kb_analysis assumes only the homogeneity of thevariances of the residuals ( as kb_a consequence of unit-treatmentadditivity ) and uses the randomization procedure of the kb_experiment .both these analyses require kb_homoscedasticity , as an assumption for the normal-model kb_analysis and as kb_a consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomization-based kb_analysis .however , studies of processes thatchange variances rather than means ( called kb_dispersion_(optics) effects ) havebeen successfully conducted using anova . there are`` no '' necessary assumptions for anova in its full generality , but the`` kb_fluorine '' -test used for anova hypothesis testing has assumptions and practicallimitations which are of continuing kb_interest .kb_problems_(aristotle) which do not satisfy the assumptions of anova can often kb_beryllium transformed to satisfy the assumptions .the kb_property of unit-treatment additivity is not kb_invariant_(mathematics) under kb_a `` change of scale '' , kb_sulfate statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit-treatment additivity . if the kb_response_variable variable is expected to follow kb_a parametric kb_family_(biology) of kb_probability distributions , then the kb_statistician may specify ( in the protocol for the kb_experiment or kb_observational_study ) that the responses kb_beryllium transformed to stabilize the kb_variance . also , kb_a kb_statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms kb_beryllium kb_applied_science to the responses , which are believed to follow kb_a multiplicative kb_rutherford_model .according to kb_augustin-louis_cauchy 's kb_functional_equation equation kb_theorem , the kb_logarithm is the only kb_continuous_function transformation that transforms real kb_multiplication to kb_addition .anova is used in the kb_analysis of comparative experiments , those inwhich only the difference in outcomes is of kb_interest . the kb_statistical_mechanicskb_importance of the kb_experiment is determined by kb_a kb_ratio of kb_2_(number)variances . this kb_ratio is independent of several possible alterationsto the experimental kb_observations_(pierre_belon) : adding kb_a constant to allkb_observations_(pierre_belon) does not alter kb_importance . multiplying allkb_observations_(pierre_belon) by kb_a constant does not alter kb_importance . kb_sulfate anovakb_statistical_significance result is independent of constant bias andkb_fouling kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics as kb_water_well as the units used in expressing kb_observations_(pierre_belon) .in the era of kb_mechanics kb_calculation kb_it was common tosubtract kb_a constant from all kb_observations_(pierre_belon) ( when kb_cognate todropping leading digits ) to simplify kb_big_data kb_azerbaijan_in_the_eurovision_song_contest_2009 . this is an example of kb_big_datakb_coding_(social_sciences) .the calculations of anova can kb_beryllium characterized as kb_computing kb_a kb_grammatical_numberof means and variances , dividing kb_2_(number) variances and comparing the kb_ratioto kb_a handbook kb_lightness to determine kb_statistical_significance . calculatingkb_a treatment effect is then trivial , `` the effect of any treatment isestimated by taking the difference between the kb_mean of thekb_observations_(pierre_belon) which receive the treatment and the kb_general_(united_states) kb_mean '' .anova uses traditional standardized terminology . the definitionalequation of kb_sample_(statistics) kb_variance isformula_12 , where thedivisor is called the kb_degrees_of_freedom_(statistics) kb_freedom ( df ) , the kb_summation is calledthe kb_sum_of_squares_(statistics) kb_square_(algebra) ( kb_schutzstaffel ) , the result is called the kb_mean kb_square ( ms ) andthe squared terms are deviations from the kb_sample_(statistics) kb_mean . anovaestimates 3 kb_sample_(statistics) variances : kb_a total kb_variance based on all thekb_observation deviations from the grand kb_mean , an kb_error kb_variance based onall the kb_observation deviations from their appropriatetreatment means , and kb_a treatment kb_variance . the treatment kb_variance isbased on the deviations of treatment means from the grand kb_mean , theresult kb_being multiplied by the kb_grammatical_number of kb_observations_(pierre_belon) in eachtreatment to account for the difference between the kb_variance ofkb_observations_(pierre_belon) and the kb_variance of means .the fundamental technique is kb_a partitioning of the total kb_sum_of_squares_(statistics) kb_square_(algebra) `` kb_schutzstaffel '' into components related to the effects used in the kb_rutherford_model . for example , the kb_rutherford_model for kb_a simplified anova with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_type_(biology) of treatment at different levels .the kb_grammatical_number of kb_degrees_of_freedom_(statistics) kb_freedom `` df '' can kb_beryllium partitioned in kb_a similar way : kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of these components ( that for kb_error ) specifies kb_a kb_chi-squared_distribution distribution which describes the associated kb_sum_of_squares_(statistics) kb_square_(algebra) , while the same is kb_truth for `` treatments '' if there is no treatment effect .kb_episcopal_see also kb_lack-of-fit_sum_of_squares kb_sum_of_squares_(statistics) kb_square_(algebra) .the `` kb_fluorine '' -test is used for comparing the factors of the total deviation . for example , in one-way , or single-factor anova , kb_statistical_significance is tested for by comparing the kb_fluorine test statisticwhere `` ms '' is kb_mean kb_square , formula_17 = kb_grammatical_number of treatments andformula_18 = total kb_grammatical_number of kb_noun_caseto the `` kb_fluorine '' -distribution with formula_19 , formula_20 kb_degrees_of_freedom_(statistics) kb_freedom . using the `` kb_fluorine '' -distribution is kb_a kb_natural_number candidate because the test statistic is the kb_ratio of kb_2_(number) kb_image_scaling sums of kb_square_(algebra) each of which follows kb_a kb_image_scaling kb_chi-squared_distribution distribution .the expected kb_lightness of kb_fluorine is formula_21 ( where kb_neutron is the treatment kb_sample_(statistics) size )which is 1 for no treatment effect . as values of kb_fluorine increase above 1 , the kb_evidence_(law) is increasingly inconsistent with the kb_null_hypothesis . kb_2_(number) apparent experimental methods of increasing kb_fluorine are increasing the kb_sample_(statistics) size and kb_redox the kb_error kb_variance by tight experimental controls .there are kb_2_(number) methods of concluding the anova hypothesis test , both of which produce the same result :the anova `` kb_fluorine '' -test is known to kb_beryllium nearly optimal in the kb_word_sense of minimizing false kb_negative_number kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics for kb_a fixed rate of kb_false_positive kb_positive_number kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics ( i.e . maximizing kb_power_(physics) for kb_a fixed kb_statistical_significance ) . for example , to test the hypothesis that various kb_medical_abortion treatments have exactly the same effect , the `` kb_fluorine '' -test 's `` p '' -values closely approximate the kb_permutation_test test 's p-values : the approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced . such permutation tests characterize kb_uniformly_most_powerful_test with maximum kb_power_(physics) against all kb_alternative_hypothesis kb_hypothesis , as observed by rosenbaum . the anova `` kb_fluorine '' -test ( of the null-hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect ) is recommended as kb_a practical test , because of its robustness against many alternative distributions .anova consists of separable parts ; partitioning sources of kb_varianceand hypothesis testing can kb_beryllium used individually . anova is used tosupport kb_other_(philosophy) kb_statistical_mechanics tools . kb_regression_analysis is kb_first_trimester used to fit morekb_complex_number models to kb_big_data , then anova is used to compare models with theobjective of kb_artificial_selection kb_simple_polygon ( kb_alkyl ) models that adequately describe thekb_big_data . `` such models could kb_beryllium fit without any reference to anova , butanova tools could then kb_beryllium used to make some kb_word_sense of the fitted models ,and to test kb_hypothesis about batches of coefficients . ''`` [ w ] e think of the kb_analysis of kb_variance as kb_a way of understanding and structuringmultilevel models—not as an alternative to kb_regression_analysis but as kb_a kb_toolfor summarizing kb_complex_number high-dimensional inferences ... ''the simplest kb_experiment suitable for anova kb_analysis is the completelyrandomized kb_experiment with kb_a kb_single_bond kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors . more kb_complex_number experimentswith kb_a kb_single_bond kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors involve constraints on randomization and includecompletely randomized kb_periodic_table_block and kb_latin kb_square_(algebra) ( and variants :graeco-latin kb_square_(algebra) , etc. ) . the more kb_complex_number experiments share manyof the complexities of kb_cross-platform_software factors . kb_a relatively completediscussion of the kb_analysis ( models , kb_big_data summaries , anova table ) ofthe completely randomized kb_experiment iskb_one-way_analysis_of_variance .anova generalizes to the kb_science of the effects of kb_cross-platform_software factors .when the kb_experiment includes kb_observations_(pierre_belon) at all combinations oflevels of each kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors , kb_it is termed kb_factorial_experiment .kb_factorial_experiment experimentsare more efficient than kb_a series of kb_single_bond kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors experiments and thekb_efficiency grows as the kb_grammatical_number of factors increases . consequently , kb_factorial_experiment designs are heavily used .the use of anova to kb_science the effects of kb_cross-platform_software factors has kb_a complication . in kb_a 3-way anova with factors x , y and kb_carboxybenzyl , the anova kb_rutherford_model includes terms for the main effects ( x , y , kb_carboxybenzyl ) and terms for kb_interaction_(statistics) ( xy , xz , yz , xyz ) .all terms require hypothesis tests . the proliferation of kb_interaction terms increases the kb_risk that some hypothesis test kb_will_and_testament produce kb_a kb_false_positive kb_positive_number by chance . fortunately , experience says that kb_high_middle_ages kb_order_(biology) kb_interaction_(statistics) are rare .the ability to detect kb_interaction_(statistics) is kb_a kb_major_(united_states) advantage of kb_cross-platform_softwarekb_von_neumann_algebra#factors anova . testing kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors at kb_a kb_time_(magazine) kb_hide_(skin) kb_interaction_(statistics) , butproduces apparently inconsistent experimental results .caution is advised when encountering kb_interaction_(statistics) ; testkb_interaction terms kb_first_trimester and expand the kb_analysis beyond anova ifkb_interaction_(statistics) are found . kb_literature vary in their recommendations regardingthe continuation of the anova procedure after encountering ankb_interaction . kb_interaction_(statistics) complicate the kb_interpretation_(logic) ofexperimental kb_big_data . neither the calculations of kb_importance nor theestimated treatment effects can kb_beryllium taken at face kb_lightness . `` kb_asignificant kb_interaction kb_will_and_testament often mask the kb_importance of main effects .

kb_isomer exists . although this is not strictly necessary , the usage is still common in kb_noun_case where there is an important difference in kb_chemical_property between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers , e.g. , `` kb_neutron '' -hexane or 2- or 3-methylpentane . alternative names for this kb_group_(periodic_table) are : kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history paraffins or `` kb_neutron '' -paraffins .the members of the series ( in terms of kb_grammatical_number of kb_carbon atoms ) are kb_english_alphabet#letter_names as follows :the kb_first_trimester four names were kb_derived_trait from kb_methanol , kb_ether , kb_propionic_acid kb_acid and kb_butyric_acid kb_acid , respectively ( kb_hexadecane is also sometimes referred to as cetane ) . alkanes

kb_de_jure distinct from the alkanes , this kb_class_(biology) of kb_hydrocarbons is referred to by some as the `` cyclic alkanes . '' as their description implies , they contain kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or more kb_ring_(mathematics) .kb_simple_polygon cycloalkanes have kb_a kb_prefix `` cyclo- '' to distinguish them from alkanes . cycloalkanes are kb_english_alphabet#letter_names as per their kb_open-chain_compound counterparts with respect to the kb_grammatical_number of kb_carbon atoms in their backbones , e.g. , kb_cyclopentane ( ch ) is kb_a kb_cycloalkane with 5 kb_carbon atoms just like kb_pentane ( ch ) , but they are joined up in kb_a five-membered kb_ring_(mathematics) . in kb_a similar manner , kb_propane and kb_cyclopropane , kb_butane and kb_cyclobutane , etc .substituted cycloalkanes are kb_english_alphabet#letter_names similarly to substituted alkanes — the kb_cycloalkane kb_ring_(mathematics) is stated , and the kb_substituents are according to their kb_positional_notation on the kb_ring_(mathematics) , with the numbering decided by the kb_cahn–ingold–prelog_priority_rules priority kb_biological_rules .the trivial ( non-systematic ) kb_toponymy for alkanes is 'paraffins ' . together , alkanes are known as the 'paraffin series ' . trivial names for kb_chemical_compound are usually historical kb_artifact_(archaeology) . they were kb_neologism before the development of kb_iupac_nomenclature names , and have been retained due to familiar usage in kb_industry . cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes .kb_it is almost certain that the kb_terminology 'paraffin ' stems from the kb_petrochemical_industry . branched-chain alkanes are called isoparaffins . the use of the kb_terminology `` paraffin '' is kb_a kb_general_(united_states) kb_terminology and often does not distinguish between pure kb_chemical_compound and mixtures of isomers , i.e. , kb_chemical_compound of the same kb_chemical_formula , e.g. , kb_pentane and kb_isopentanealkanes experience kb_intermolecular van der waals kb_afsharid_dynasty . stronger kb_intermolecular van der waals kb_afsharid_dynasty give rise to greater kb_boiling_points points of alkanes .there are kb_2_(number) determinants for the kb_strength_of_materials of the van der waals kb_afsharid_dynasty :under kb_standard_conditions conditions , from ch to ch alkanes are gaseous ; from ch to ch they are liquids ; and after ch they are solids . as the kb_boiling_point point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight , kb_it should not kb_beryllium kb_a surprise that the kb_boiling_point point has almost kb_a kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history relationship with the size ( kb_molecular_weight ) of the kb_molecule . as kb_a kb_rule_of_thumb of thumb , the kb_boiling_point point kb_ice_rise 20–30 °c for each kb_carbon added to the chain ; this rule applies to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_homologous_series .kb_a straight-chain kb_alkane kb_will_and_testament have kb_a kb_boiling_point point higher than kb_a branched-chain kb_alkane due to the greater kb_surface_area in contact , thus the greater van der waals kb_afsharid_dynasty , between adjacent molecules . for example , compare kb_isobutane ( 2-methylpropane ) and kb_n-butane ( kb_butane ) , which kb_boil at −12 and 0 °c , and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which kb_boil at 50 and 58 °c , respectively . for the latter case , kb_2_(number) molecules 2,3-dimethylbutane can `` lock '' into each kb_other_(philosophy) better than the cross-shaped 2,2-dimethylbutane , hence the greater van der waals kb_afsharid_dynasty .on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , cycloalkanes tend to have higher kb_boiling_points points than their kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules , which give kb_a kb_plane_(geometry) of kb_intermolecular contact .the kb_melting_point points of the alkanes follow kb_a similar trend to kb_boiling_points points for the same kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving as outlined above . that is , ( all kb_other_(philosophy) things kb_being equal ) the larger the kb_molecule the higher the kb_melting_point . there is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) significant difference between kb_boiling_points points and kb_melting_point points . solids have more kb_rigid_airship and fixed kb_structure than liquids . this kb_rigid_airship kb_structure requires kb_energy_industry to break down . thus the better put together kb_solid kb_structural_analysis kb_will_and_testament require more kb_energy_industry to break apart . for alkanes , this can kb_beryllium seen from the graph above ( i.e. , the blue kb_line_(geometry) ) . the odd-numbered alkanes have kb_a lower trend in kb_melting_point points than even numbered alkanes . this is because even numbered alkanes pack kb_water_well in the kb_solid kb_phase_(matter) , forming kb_a well-organized kb_structure , which requires more kb_energy_industry to break apart . the odd-numbered alkanes pack less kb_water_well and kb_sulfate the `` looser '' organized kb_solid packing kb_structure requires less kb_energy_industry to break apart .the kb_melting_point points of branched-chain alkanes can kb_beryllium either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes , again depending on the ability of the kb_alkane in kb_question to pack kb_water_well in the kb_solid kb_phase_(matter) : this is particularly kb_truth for kb_isoalkanes ( 2-methyl isomers ) , which often have kb_melting_point points higher than those of the kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history analogues .alkanes do not conduct electricity in any way , nor are they substantially kb_relative_static_permittivity by an kb_electric_field field . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , they do not kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_hydrogen bonds and are kb_insoluble in kb_polar_molecule solvents such as kb_water . since the kb_hydrogen bonds between kb_individual kb_water molecules are aligned away from an kb_alkane kb_molecule , the coexistence of an kb_alkane and kb_water leads to an increase in kb_molecular_genetics kb_order_(biology) ( kb_a kb_redox in kb_entropy ) . as there is no significant kb_chemical_bond between kb_water molecules and kb_alkane molecules , the kb_second_law_of_thermodynamics of kb_thermodynamics suggests that this kb_redox in kb_entropy should kb_beryllium minimized by minimizing the contact between kb_alkane and kb_water : alkanes are said to kb_beryllium kb_hydrophobe in that they repel kb_water .their kb_solubility in kb_nonpolar solvents is relatively good , kb_a kb_property that is called kb_lipophilicitythe kb_molecular_genetics kb_structure of the alkanes directly kb_affect_(psychology) their kb_health and kb_protein_sequencing characteristics . kb_it is kb_derived_trait from the kb_electron_configuration of kb_carbon , which has four valence electrons . the kb_carbon atoms in alkanes are always kb_orbital_hybridization , that is to say that the valence electrons are said to kb_beryllium in four kb_cognate orbitals kb_derived_trait from the combination of the 2s kb_atomic_orbital and the kb_triliteral 2p orbitals . these orbitals , which have kb_identical_particles energies , are arranged spatially in the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_a kb_tetrahedron , the kb_angle of cos ( − ) ≈ 109.47° between them .an kb_alkane kb_molecule has only kb_c–h_bond and c–c kb_single_bond bonds . the former result from the overlap of an sp kb_atomic_orbital of kb_carbon with the 1s kb_atomic_orbital of kb_a kb_hydrogen ; the latter by the overlap of kb_2_(number) sp orbitals on different kb_carbon atoms . the kb_chemical_bond lengthsthe spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp orbitals—they are tetrahedrally arranged , with an kb_angle of 109.47° between them . kb_structural_engineer formulae that represent the bonds as kb_being at kb_right-wing_politics angles to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) another , while both common and useful , do not correspond with the kb_reality .the kb_structural_engineer kb_chemical_formula and the kb_chemical_bond angles are not usually sufficient to completely describe the kb_geometry of kb_a kb_molecule . there is kb_a

atoms have an kb_angle of 120° between them , resulting from the projection of the kb_base_(chemistry) of the kb_tetrahedron onto kb_a flat kb_plane_(geometry) . however , the kb_torsion_angle between kb_a given kb_hydrogen_atom attached to the front kb_carbon and kb_a given kb_hydrogen_atom attached to the rear kb_carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360° . this is kb_a consequence of the free kb_rotation_(mathematics) about kb_a carbon–carbon kb_single_bond . despite this apparent kb_freedom , only kb_2_(number) limiting conformations are important : kb_eclipsed kb_conformational_isomerism and kb_staggered_conformation kb_conformational_isomerism .the kb_2_(number) conformations , also known as rotamers , differ in kb_energy_industry : the kb_staggered_conformation kb_conformational_isomerism is 12.6 kb_kilojoule_per_mole lower in kb_energy_industry ( more stable ) than the kb_eclipsed kb_conformational_isomerism ( the least stable ) .this difference in kb_energy_industry between the kb_2_(number) conformations , known as the kb_torsion_energy , is low compared to the kb_thermal_conductivity kb_energy_industry of an kb_ethane kb_molecule at ambient kb_temperature . there is constant kb_rotation_(mathematics) about the c–c kb_chemical_bond . the kb_time_(magazine) taken for an kb_ethane kb_molecule to pass from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_staggered_conformation kb_conformational_isomerism to the kb_next , kb_cognate to the kb_rotation_(mathematics) of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) ch kb_group_(periodic_table) by 120° relative to the kb_other_(philosophy) , is of the kb_order_(biology) of 10 seconds .the case of kb_higher_alkanes alkanes is more kb_complex_number but based on similar principles , with the antiperiplanar kb_conformational_isomerism always kb_being the most favored around each kb_carbon–carbon_bond kb_chemical_bond . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , alkanes are usually shown in kb_a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models . the actual kb_structure kb_will_and_testament always differ somewhat from these idealized kb_theory_of_forms , as the differences in kb_energy_industry between the conformations are small compared to the kb_thermal_conductivity kb_energy_industry of the molecules : kb_alkane molecules have no fixed kb_structural_engineer kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , whatever the models may suggest .virtually all kb_organic_compounds contain carbon–carbon , and carbon–hydrogen bonds , and kb_sulfate show some of the features of alkanes in their kb_emission_spectrum . alkanes are notable for having no kb_other_(philosophy) kb_group_(mathematics) , and therefore for the `` absence '' of kb_other_(philosophy) kb_characteristic_(algebra) kb_spectroscopy features of kb_a different kb_functional_group kb_group_(periodic_table) like kb_alcohol_(chemistry) , kb_aldehyde , kb_carboxylic_acid etc .the carbon–hydrogen kb_stretching kb_musical_mode gives kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force absorption between 2850 and 2960 kb_wavenumber , while the carbon–carbon kb_stretching kb_musical_mode absorbs between 800 and 1300 kb_wavenumber . the carbon–hydrogen bending modes depend on the kb_nature of the kb_group_(periodic_table) : kb_methyl_group kb_group_(mathematics) show bands at 1450 kb_wavenumber and 1375 kb_wavenumber , while methylene kb_group_(mathematics) show bands at 1465 kb_wavenumber and 1450 kb_wavenumber . kb_carbon chains with more than four kb_carbon atoms show kb_a weak absorption at around 725 kb_wavenumber .the kb_proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at `` δ '' = 0.5–1.5 . the carbon-13 resonances depend on the kb_grammatical_number of kb_hydrogen atoms attached to the kb_carbon : `` δ '' = 8–30 ( kb_primary_education , kb_methyl_group , –ch ) , 15–55 ( kb_secondary_school , methylene , –ch– ) , 20–60 ( kb_tertiary_healthcare , methyne , kb_c–h_bond ) and quaternary . the carbon-13 kb_resonance of quaternary kb_carbon atoms is characteristically weak , due to the lack of kb_nuclear_overhauser_effect overhauser effect and the kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_relaxation_time , and can kb_beryllium missed in weak samples , or samples that have not been run for kb_a sufficiently kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_time_(magazine) .alkanes have kb_a kb_high_middle_ages kb_ionization_energy , and the kb_molecular_genetics kb_ion is usually weak . the fragmentation kb_pattern can kb_beryllium difficult to interpret , but , in the case of branched chain alkanes , the kb_carbon_chain is preferentially cleaved at kb_tertiary_healthcare or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals . the fragment resulting from the loss of kb_a kb_single_bond kb_methyl_group ( `` kb_mole_(unit) '' − 15 ) is often absent , and kb_other_(philosophy) fragments are often spaced by intervals of fourteen kb_mass_(liturgy) units , corresponding to sequential loss of ch kb_group_(mathematics) .alkanes are only weakly kb_reactivity_(chemistry) with kb_ionic_crystal and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_polar_molecule substances . the kb_acid_dissociation_constant constant ( kb_pka ) values of all alkanes are above 60 , hence they are practically kb_inert_gas to acids and kb_base_(chemistry) ( kb_episcopal_see : kb_carbon acids ) . this inertness is the source of the kb_terminology `` paraffins '' ( with the kb_meaning_(linguistics) here of `` lacking affinity '' ) . in kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil the kb_alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years .however kb_redox reactions of alkanes , in kb_particular with kb_oxygen and the halogens , are possible as the kb_carbon atoms are in kb_a strongly kb_redox condition ; in the case of kb_methane , the lowest possible kb_oxidation_state for kb_carbon ( −4 ) is reached . reaction with kb_oxygen ( `` if '' present in sufficient kb_quantity to satisfy the reaction kb_stoichiometry ) leads to kb_combustion without any smoke , producing kb_carbon_dioxide and kb_water . kb_free_radical_halogenation halogenation reactions occur with halogens , leading to the production of kb_haloalkanes . in kb_addition , alkanes have been shown to interact with , and bind to , certain kb_transition_metal complexes in kb_carbon-hydrogen_bond_activation activation .free radicals , molecules with unpaired electrons , play kb_a kb_prespa_lake role in most reactions of alkanes , such as kb_cracking_(chemistry) and kb_protestant_reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers .in highly branched alkanes , the kb_bond_angle may differ significantly from the optimal kb_lightness ( 109.5° ) in kb_order_(biology) to allow the different kb_group_(mathematics) sufficient kb_space . this kb_causes_of_autism kb_a tension in the kb_molecule , known as kb_steric_hindrance hindrance , and can substantially increase the kb_reactivity_(chemistry) .all alkanes react with kb_oxygen in kb_a kb_combustion reaction , although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the kb_grammatical_number of kb_carbon atoms increases . the kb_general_(united_states) equation for complete kb_combustion is :in the absence of sufficient kb_oxygen , kb_carbon_monoxide or even kb_soot can kb_beryllium formed , as shown kb_#ecclesiastical_history :for example , kb_methane :kb_episcopal_see the kb_standard_enthalpy_change_of_formation_(data_table)#alkanes of formation table for detailed kb_big_data .the kb_standard_enthalpy_change_of_combustion enthalpy change of kb_combustion , δ '' kb_hydrogen '' , for alkanes increases by about 650 kb_kilojoule_per_mole per ch kb_group_(periodic_table) . branched-chain alkanes have lower values of δ '' kb_hydrogen '' than straight-chain alkanes of the same kb_grammatical_number of kb_carbon atoms , and kb_sulfate can kb_beryllium seen to kb_beryllium somewhat more stable .alkanes react with halogens in kb_a so-called `` kb_free_radical_halogenation halogenation '' reaction . the kb_hydrogen atoms of the kb_alkane are progressively replaced by kb_halogen atoms . free radicals are the kb_reactivity_(chemistry) kb_species that participate in the reaction , which usually leads to kb_a kb_mixture of products . the reaction is highly kb_exothermickb_cracking_(chemistry) breaks larger molecules into smaller ones . this can kb_beryllium done with kb_a kb_thermal_conductivity or catalytic method . the kb_thermal_conductivity kb_cracking_(chemistry) process follows kb_a kb_homolysis_(chemistry) kb_mechanism_(biology) with formation of free-radicals . the catalytic kb_cracking_(chemistry) process involves the presence of kb_acid kb_catalysis ( usually kb_solid acids such as kb_silica-alumina and zeolites ) , which promote kb_a kb_heterolytic_cleavage ( asymmetric ) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of kb_ions of kb_phyllotaxis charges , usually kb_a kb_carbocation and the very unstable kb_hydride kb_anion . carbon-localized free radicals and kb_cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement , c–c scission in kb_positional_notation kb_beta_decay ( i.e. , kb_cracking_(chemistry) ) and kb_intramolecular and kb_intermolecular kb_hydrogen transfer or kb_hydride transfer . in both types of processes , the corresponding kb_reactivity_(chemistry) intermediates ( radicals , kb_ions ) are permanently regenerated , and thus they proceed by kb_a self-propagating chain kb_mechanism_(biology) . the chain of reactions is eventually terminated by kb_political_radicalism or kb_ion kb_recombination_(cosmology) .dragan and kb_histidine colleague were the kb_first_trimester to report about isomerization in alkanes . isomerization and kb_protestant_reformation are processes in which straight-chain alkanes are heated in the presence of kb_a kb_platinum kb_catalyst . in isomerization , the alkanes become branched-chain isomers . in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_lexical_semantics , kb_it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens , keeping the same kb_molecular_weight . in kb_protestant_reformation , the alkanes become cycloalkanes or kb_aromatic kb_hydrocarbons , giving off kb_hydrogen as kb_a by-product . both of these processes raise the kb_octane_number of the kb_matter . kb_butane is the most common kb_alkane that is put under the process of isomerization , as kb_it makes many branched alkanes with kb_high_middle_ages kb_octane kb_grammatical_number .alkanes kb_will_and_testament react with kb_steam in the presence of kb_a kb_nickel kb_catalyst to give kb_hydrogen . alkanes can kb_beryllium kb_chlorosulfonation and kb_nitration , although both reactions require special conditions . the kb_fermentation_(biochemistry) of alkanes to carboxylic acids is of some technical importance . in the kb_reed_reaction reaction , kb_sulfur_dioxide , kb_chlorine and kb_light convert kb_hydrocarbons to kb_sulfonic_acid kb_chlorides . kb_nucleophilic_abstraction kb_abstraction can kb_beryllium used to separate an kb_alkane from kb_a kb_metal . kb_alkyl kb_group_(mathematics) can kb_beryllium transferred from

kb_gas planets such as kb_jupiter ( 0.1 % kb_methane , kb_alkaline_earth_metal kb_parts_per_million kb_ethane ) , kb_saturn ( 0.2 % kb_methane , 5 kb_parts_per_million kb_ethane ) , kb_uranus ( 1.99 % kb_methane , 2.5 kb_parts_per_million kb_ethane ) and kb_neptune ( 1.5 % kb_methane , 1.5 kb_parts_per_million kb_ethane ) . kb_titan_(mythology) ( 1.6 % kb_methane ) , kb_a kb_satellite of kb_saturn , was examined by the `` kb_christiaan_huygens '' kb_interplanetary_probe , which indicated that kb_titan_(mythology) 's kb_earth's_atmosphere periodically rains kb_liquid kb_methane onto the kb_moon 's kb_surface_(topology) . also on kb_titan_(mythology) the cassini mission has imaged seasonal methane/ethane kb_list_of_lakes_in_alberta near the kb_polar_molecule kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey of kb_titan_(mythology) . kb_methane and kb_ethane have also been kb_discovery_of_the_chemical_elements in the kb_tail of the kb_comet kb_hyakutake . kb_protein_sequencing kb_analysis showed that the abundances of kb_ethane and kb_methane were roughly equal , which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar kb_space , away from the kb_sun , which would have kb_evaporation these kb_volatiles molecules . alkanes have also been kb_discovery_of_the_chemical_elements in meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites .kb_trace_radioisotope of kb_methane kb_gas ( about 0.0002 % or kb_battle_of_anguilla ppb ) occur in the kb_earth 's kb_earth's_atmosphere , produced primarily by kb_methanogenesis microorganisms , such as kb_archaea in the gut of ruminants .the most important commercial sources for alkanes are kb_natural_gas and kb_palm_oil . kb_natural_gas contains primarily kb_methane and kb_ethane , with some kb_propane and kb_butane : kb_palm_oil is kb_a kb_mixture of kb_liquid alkanes and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hydrocarbons environment and converted over many millions of years at kb_high_middle_ages temperatures and kb_high_middle_ages kb_pressure to their kb_electric_current kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . kb_natural_gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction :these kb_hydrocarbon kb_deposit_(geology) , collected in porous kb_rock_(geology) trapped beneath impermeable cap kb_rock_(geology) , comprise commercial kb_oil_fields . they have formed over millions of years and once exhausted can not kb_beryllium readily replaced . the depletion of these kb_hydrocarbons reserves is the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) for what is known as the kb_energy_crisis .kb_methane is also present in what is called kb_biogas , produced by kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing and decaying kb_matter , which is kb_a possible kb_renewable_energy_source source .alkanes have kb_a low kb_solubility in kb_water , kb_sulfate the content in the oceans is negligible ; however , at kb_high_middle_ages pressures and low temperatures ( such as at the bottom of the oceans ) , kb_methane can co-crystallize with kb_water to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_solid kb_methane_clathratecertain types of kb_bacteria can kb_metabolism alkanes : they prefer even-numbered kb_carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-numbered chains .on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , certain kb_archaea , the methanogens , produce kb_prespa_lake quantities of kb_methane by the kb_metabolism of kb_carbon_dioxide or kb_other_(philosophy) kb_oxidation kb_organic_compounds . the kb_energy_industry is released by the kb_redox of kb_hydrogen :methanogens are also the producers of kb_marsh_gas kb_gas in kb_wetlands , and release about kb_2_(number) kb_billion kb_tonnes of kb_methane per year—the atmospheric content of this kb_gas is produced nearly exclusively by them . the kb_methane output of kb_cattle and kb_other_(philosophy) herbivores , which can release 30 to 50 gallons per day , and of kb_termites , is also due to methanogens . they also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the kb_intestines of humans . kb_methanogenesis kb_archaea are , hence , at the end of the kb_carbon_cycle , with kb_carbon kb_being released back into kb_earth's_atmosphere kb_earth's_atmosphere after having been fixed by kb_photosynthesis . kb_it is probable that our kb_electric_current kb_deposit_(geology) of kb_natural_gas were formed in kb_a similar way .alkanes also play kb_a role , if kb_a minor role , in the kb_biology of the kb_triliteral kb_eukaryote kb_group_(mathematics) of organisms : kb_fungi , plants and kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing . some specialized yeasts , e.g. , `` candida tropicale '' , `` kb_pichia '' sp. , `` kb_rhodotorula '' sp. , can use alkanes as kb_a source of kb_carbon or kb_energy_industry . the fungus `` kb_amorphotheca_resinae resinae '' prefers the longer-chain alkanes in kb_aviation_fuel , and can cause serious kb_problems_(aristotle) for kb_aircraft in kb_tropical kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey .in plants , the kb_solid long-chain alkanes are found in the kb_plant_cuticle and kb_epicuticular_wax kb_beeswax of many kb_species , but are only rarely kb_major_(united_states) kb_electoral_district . they protect the kb_plant against kb_water loss , prevent the kb_leaching_(agriculture) of important kb_minerals by the kb_rain , and protect against kb_bacteria , kb_fungi , and harmful insects . the kb_carbon chains in kb_plant alkanes are usually odd-numbered , between 27 and 33 kb_carbon atoms in kb_length and are made by the plants by kb_decarboxylation of even-numbered fatty acids . the exact kb_function_composition of the layer of kb_beeswax is not only species-dependent but changes also with the kb_season and such kb_environmental_factors factors as lighting conditions , kb_temperature or kb_humidity .more kb_volatiles short-chain alkanes are also produced by and found in kb_plant kb_tissue_(biology) . the kb_jeffrey_pine kb_pine is noted for producing exceptionally kb_high_middle_ages levels of `` kb_neutron '' -heptane in its kb_resin , for which kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving its distillate was designated as the kb_0_(number) point for kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_octane_rating . floral scents have also kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) been known to contain kb_volatiles kb_alkane components , and `` kb_neutron '' -nonane is kb_a significant component in the scent of some kb_rosaceae . kb_emission_spectra of gaseous and kb_volatiles alkanes such as kb_ethane , kb_pentane , and kb_hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels , though they are not generally considered to kb_beryllium kb_a kb_major_(united_states) component of biogenic kb_air_pollution .edible kb_vegetable kb_cooking_oil also typically contain small kb_egyptian_fraction of biogenic alkanes with kb_a wide kb_visible_spectrum of kb_carbon kb_grammatical_number , mainly kb_group_8_element to kb_35_arietis , usually peaking in the low to kb_upper_egypt 20s , with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram ( kb_part_per_million per million by weight ) and sometimes over kb_a hundred for the total kb_alkane kb_fraction_(mathematics) .alkanes are found in kb_animal products , although they are less important than unsaturated kb_hydrocarbons . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) example is the kb_shark kb_liver_oil , which is approximately 14 % kb_pristane ( 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane , ch ) . they are important as pheromones , kb_protein_sequencing messenger materials , on which insects depend for kb_communication . in some kb_species , e.g . the support beetle `` kb_xylotrechus_colonus colonus '' , kb_pentacosane ( ch ) , 3-methylpentaicosane ( ch ) and 9-methylpentaicosane ( ch ) are transferred by kb_human_body contact . with others like the kb_tsetse_fly kb_flight `` glossina morsitans morsitans '' , the kb_pheromone contains the four alkanes 2-methylheptadecane ( ch ) , 17,21-dimethylheptatriacontane ( ch ) , 15,19-dimethylheptatriacontane ( ch ) and 15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane ( ch ) , and acts by smell over longer distances . kb_waggle_dance kb_honey beeskb_one_(australian_tv_channel) example , in which both kb_plant and kb_animal alkanes play kb_a role , is the ecological relationship between the kb_sand_bee ( `` kb_andrena_nigroaenea nigroaenea '' ) and the kb_early_spider_orchid kb_spider kb_orchid ( `` kb_ophrys_sphegodes sphegodes '' ) ; the latter is dependent for kb_pollination on the former . kb_sand bees use pheromones in kb_order_(biology) to identify kb_a kb_mating ; in the case of `` a. nigroaenea '' , the females emit kb_a kb_mixture of kb_tricosane ( ch ) , kb_pentacosane ( ch ) and kb_heptacosaneas stated kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet , the most important source of alkanes is kb_natural_gas and kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil . alkanes are separated in an kb_oil_refinery by kb_fractional_distillation kb_distillation and processed into many different products .the kb_fischer–tropsch_process process is kb_a method to kb_biosynthesis kb_liquid kb_hydrocarbons , including alkanes , from kb_carbon_monoxide and kb_hydrogen . this method is used to produce substitutes for kb_petroleum distillates .there is usually little need for alkanes to kb_beryllium synthesized in the kb_laboratory , since they are usually commercially kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance . also , alkanes are generally kb_reactivity_(chemistry) chemically or biologically , and do not undergo kb_functional_group kb_group_(periodic_table) interconversions cleanly . when alkanes are produced in the kb_laboratory , kb_it is often kb_a side-product of kb_a reaction . for example , the use of `` kb_neutron '' -butyllithium as kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_base_(chemistry) gives the conjugate kb_acid , `` kb_neutron '' -butane as kb_a side-product :however , at times kb_it may kb_beryllium desirable to make kb_a kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) of kb_a kb_molecule into an alkane-like functionality ( kb_alkyl kb_group_(periodic_table) ) using the above or similar methods . for example , an kb_ethyl_group is an kb_alkyl kb_group_(periodic_table) ; when this is attached to kb_a kb_hydroxyl kb_group_(periodic_table) , kb_it gives kb_ethanol , which is not an kb_alkane . to kb_women's_suffrage kb_sulfate , the best-known methods are kb_hydrogenation of kb_alkenes :alkanes or kb_alkyl kb_group_(mathematics) can also kb_beryllium prepared directly from kb_alkyl halides in the kb_corey–house_synthesis reaction . the kb_barton–mccombie_deoxygenation deoxygenation removes kb_hydroxy_group kb_group_(mathematics) from alcohols e.g .and the kb_clemmensen_reduction kb_redox removes kb_carbonyl kb_group_(mathematics) from kb_aldehydes and ketones to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism alkanes or alkyl-substituted kb_chemical_compound e.g . :the applications of alkanes depend on the kb_grammatical_number of kb_carbon atoms . the kb_first_trimester four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes , and in some countries for electricity generation . kb_methane and kb_ethane are the main components of kb_natural_gas ; they are normally stored as gases under kb_pressure . kb_it is , however , easier to kb_transport them as liquids : this requires both kb_dynamic_range_compression and cooling of the kb_gas .kb_propane and kb_butane are gases at atmospheric kb_pressure that can kb_beryllium liquefied at fairly low pressures and are commonly known as kb_liquified_petroleum_gas kb_petroleum kb_gas ( lpg ) . kb_propane is used in kb_propane kb_gas burners and as kb_a kb_fuel for road vehicles , kb_butane in kb_space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters . both are used as propellants in kb_aerosol sprays .from kb_pentane to kb_octane the alkanes are highly kb_volatiles liquids . they are used as fuels in internal kb_combustion engines , as they vaporize easily on kb_azerbaijan_in_the_eurovision_song_contest_2009 into the kb_combustion_chamber without forming droplets , which would impair the uniformity of the kb_combustion . branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition , which kb_causes_of_autism kb_engine_knocking , than their straight-chain kb_homology_(chemistry) . this propensity to premature ignition is measured by the kb_octane_rating of the kb_fuel , where kb_2,2,4-trimethylpentane ( `` isooctane '' ) has an arbitrary kb_lightness of 100 , and kb_heptane has kb_a kb_lightness of kb_0_(number) . apart from their use as fuels , the middle alkanes are also good solvents for kb_nonpolar substances .alkanes from kb_nonane to , for instance , kb_hexadecane ( an kb_alkane with sixteen kb_carbon atoms ) are liquids of higher kb_viscosity , less and less suitable for use in kb_gasoline . they kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism instead the

kb_toponymy for kb_hexadecane . however , the higher kb_melting_point points of these alkanes can cause kb_problems_(aristotle) at low temperatures and in kb_polar_molecule kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey , where the kb_fuel becomes too thick to kb_flow_(psychology) correctly .alkanes from kb_hexadecane upwards kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the most important

kb_beryllium confused however with kb_truth kb_beeswax , which consists primarily of esters .alkanes with kb_a chain kb_length of approximately kb_35_arietis or more kb_carbon atoms are found in kb_asphalt , used , for example , in road surfacing . however , the kb_higher_alkanes alkanes have little kb_lightness and are usually split into lower alkanes by kb_cracking_(chemistry) .some

the kb_biological_rules and kb_regulatory_economics for filing appeals in kb_state_court_(united_states) and kb_united_states_federal_courts . the kb_nature of an kb_appeal can vary greatly depending on the kb_type_(biology) of case and the kb_biological_rules of the kb_court in the kb_jurisdiction where the case was prosecuted . there are many types of kb_standard_of_review of kb_review for appeals , such as `` kb_trial_de_novo '' and kb_abuse_of_discretion of discretion . however , most appeals begin when kb_a party kb_file_(tool) kb_a kb_petition_for_review kb_review to kb_a higher kb_court for the purpose of overturning the kb_lower_court kb_court 's decision .an kb_appellate_court kb_court is kb_a kb_court that hears kb_noun_case on kb_appeal from another kb_court . depending

there is kb_a kb_right-wing_politics of kb_appeal from kb_a kb_particular kb_type_(biology) of decision , can vary greatly from kb_state_of_matter to kb_state_of_matter . the kb_right-wing_politics to file an kb_appeal can also vary from kb_state_of_matter to kb_state_of_matter ; for example , the kb_new_jersey_constitution vests kb_judicial_power kb_power_(physics) in kb_a supreme kb_court , kb_a superior kb_court , and kb_other_(philosophy) courts of limited kb_jurisdiction , with an kb_appellate_court kb_court kb_being part of the superior kb_court .kb_a party kb_world_health_organization kb_file_(tool) an kb_appeal is called an `` appellant '' , `` kb_plaintiff in kb_error '' , `` petitioner '' or `` pursuer '' , and kb_a party on the kb_other_(philosophy) side is called kb_a ``

kb_court can not refuse to listen to the kb_appeal . an kb_appeal `` by leave '' or `` permission '' requires the appellant to obtain leave to kb_appeal ; in such kb_a situation either or both of the kb_lower_court kb_court and the kb_court may have the discretion to kb_ulysses_s._grant or refuse the appellant 's demand to kb_appeal the kb_lower_court kb_court 's decision . in the supreme kb_court , kb_review in most kb_noun_case is kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance only if the kb_court exercises its discretion and grants kb_a writ of certiorari .in kb_tort , kb_equity_(law) , or kb_other_(philosophy) civil matters either party to kb_a previous case may file an kb_appeal . in criminal matters , however , the kb_state_of_matter or prosecution generally has no kb_appeal `` as of kb_right-wing_politics '' . and due to the kb_double_jeopardy jeopardy kb_principle_(chemistry) , the kb_state_of_matter or prosecution may never kb_appeal kb_a kb_jury or bench verdict of acquittal . but in some jurisdictions , the kb_state_of_matter or prosecution may kb_appeal `` as of kb_right-wing_politics '' from kb_a kb_trial_court 's dismissal of an kb_indictment in whole or in part or from kb_a kb_trial_court 's granting of kb_a kb_defendant 's suppression kb_motion_(physics) . likewise , in some jurisdictions , the kb_state_of_matter or prosecution may kb_appeal an issue of kb_law `` by leave '' from kb_the_trial kb_trial_court or the kb_appellate_court kb_court . the ability of the prosecution to kb_appeal kb_a decision in favor of kb_a kb_defendant varies significantly internationally . all parties must present grounds to kb_appeal , or kb_it kb_will_and_testament not kb_beryllium heard .by kb_fan_convention in some kb_law reports , the appellant is kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_first_trimester . this can kb_mean that where kb_it is the kb_defendant kb_world_health_organization appeals , the kb_toponymy of the case in kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law reports reverses ( in some kb_noun_case twice ) as the appeals kb_cold_working their way up the kb_court hierarchy . this is not always kb_truth , however . in the kb_united_states_federal_courts , the parties ' names always stay in the same kb_order_(biology) as the kb_lower_court kb_court when an kb_appeal is taken to the kb_united_states_courts_of_appeals courts of appeals , and are re-ordered only if the kb_appeal reaches the supreme kb_court .many jurisdictions recognize kb_2_(number) types of appeals , particularly in the criminal kb_context_(language_use) . the kb_first_trimester is the traditional `` direct '' kb_appeal in which the appellant kb_file_(tool) an kb_appeal with the kb_next higher kb_court of kb_review . the kb_second_language is the collateral kb_appeal or post-conviction kb_petition , in which the petitioner-appellant kb_file_(tool) the kb_appeal in kb_a kb_court of kb_first_trimester instance—usually the kb_court that tried the case .the kb_key_(cryptography) distinguishing kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in kb_state_court_(united_states) , and the latter in kb_united_states_federal_courts .kb_relief in post-conviction is rare and is most often found in kb_list_of_australian_capital_cities or violent kb_felony kb_noun_case . the typical scenario involves an incarcerated kb_defendant locating kb_dna kb_evidence_(law) demonstrating the kb_defendant 's actual innocence .`` appellate kb_review '' is the kb_general_(united_states) kb_terminology for the process by which courts with appellate kb_jurisdiction kb_take kb_jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts . kb_it is distinguished from kb_judicial_review kb_review , which refers to the kb_court 's overriding kb_constitution_of_albania or kb_statute kb_right-wing_politics to determine if kb_a kb_legislative act or kb_administration_(government) decision is defective for jurisdictional or kb_other_(philosophy) reasons ( which may vary by kb_jurisdiction ) .in most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate kb_review is by filing an kb_appeal of the kb_final_judgment kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition . generally , an kb_appeal of the kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition kb_will_and_testament also allow kb_appeal of all kb_other_(philosophy) kb_order_(biology) or rulings made by kb_the_trial kb_trial_court in the course of the case . this is because such kb_order_(biology) can not kb_beryllium appealed `` as of kb_right-wing_politics '' . however , certain critical interlocutory kb_court kb_order_(biology) , such as the denial of kb_a request for an interim kb_injunction , or an kb_order_(biology) holding kb_a kb_grammatical_person in kb_contempt_of_court of kb_court , can kb_beryllium appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of .there are kb_2_(number) distinct kb_theory_of_forms of appellate kb_review , `` direct '' and `` collateral '' . for example , kb_a criminal kb_defendant may kb_beryllium convicted in kb_state_of_matter kb_court , and lose on `` direct kb_appeal '' to higher kb_state_of_matter appellate courts , and if unsuccessful , mount kb_a `` collateral '' action such as filing for kb_a writ of kb_habeas_corpus corpus in the kb_united_states_federal_courts . generally speaking , `` [ d ] irect kb_appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of kb_a kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition and allege kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics of kb_law or kb_fact . ... [ collateral kb_review ] , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , provide [ kb_sulfur ] an independent and civil kb_inquiry into the kb_validity_(logic) of kb_a conviction and kb_sentence_(law) , and as such are generally limited to challenges to kb_constitution_of_albania , jurisdictional , or kb_other_(philosophy) fundamental violations that occurred at kb_jury_trial .

kb_law courts , appellate kb_review of kb_lower_court kb_court decisions may also kb_beryllium obtained by filing kb_a kb_petition_for_review kb_review by kb_prerogative_writ writ in certain kb_noun_case . there is no corresponding kb_right-wing_politics to kb_a writ in any pure or kb_continental_dollar kb_civil_law_(legal_system) kb_law kb_law kb_systems_analysis , though some mixed kb_systems_analysis such as kb_province_of_quebec_(1763–1791) recognize these prerogative writs .after exhausting the kb_first_trimester kb_appeal as of kb_right-wing_politics , defendants usually kb_petition the highest kb_state_of_matter kb_court to kb_review the decision . this kb_appeal is known as kb_a direct kb_appeal . the highest kb_state_of_matter kb_court , generally known as the supreme kb_court , exercises discretion over whether kb_it kb_will_and_testament kb_review the case . on direct kb_appeal , kb_a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an kb_error that occurred at kb_jury_trial or some kb_other_(philosophy) stage in the adjudicative process .an appellant 's kb_lawsuit ( kb_sulfur ) must usually kb_beryllium preserved at kb_jury_trial . this means that the kb_defendant had to kb_space_debris to the kb_error when kb_it occurred in kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial . because kb_constitution_of_albania claims are of great kb_apparent_magnitude , appellate courts might kb_beryllium more lenient to kb_review the kb_lawsuit even if kb_it was not preserved . for example , kb_connecticut applies the following standard to kb_review unpreserved claims : 1.the record is adequate to kb_review the alleged kb_lawsuit of kb_error ; 2. the kb_lawsuit is of kb_constitution_of_albania kb_apparent_magnitude alleging the violation of kb_a fundamental kb_right-wing_politics ; 3. the alleged kb_constitution_of_albania violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the kb_defendant of kb_a fair kb_jury_trial ; 4. if kb_grammatical_subject to harmless kb_error kb_analysis , the kb_state_of_matter has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged kb_constitution_of_albania violation beyond kb_a reasonable doubt .all kb_sovereign_state have kb_a post-conviction kb_relief process . similar to kb_united_states_courts_of_appeals post-conviction kb_relief , an appellant can kb_petition the kb_court to correct alleged fundamental kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics that were not corrected on direct kb_review . typical claims might include kb_ineffective_assistance_of_counsel assistance of counsel and actual innocence based on kb_new_world kb_evidence_(law) . these proceedings are normally separate from the direct kb_appeal , however some kb_sovereign_state allow for collateral kb_relief to kb_beryllium sought on direct kb_appeal . after direct kb_appeal , the conviction is considered final . an kb_appeal from the post conviction kb_court proceeds just as kb_a direct kb_appeal . that is , kb_it goes to the intermediate kb_appellate_court kb_court , followed by the highest kb_court . if the kb_petition is granted the appellant could kb_beryllium released from incarceration , the kb_sentence_(law) could kb_beryllium modified , or kb_a kb_new_world kb_jury_trial could kb_beryllium kb_totally_ordered_set .kb_a `` notice of kb_appeal '' is kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism or document that in many kb_noun_case is required to begin an kb_appeal . the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism is completed by the appellant or by the appellant 's kb_law representative . the kb_nature of this kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism can vary greatly from kb_country_music to kb_country_music and from kb_court to kb_court within kb_a kb_country_music .the specific kb_biological_rules of the kb_law system kb_will_and_testament dictate exactly how the kb_appeal is officially begun . for example , the appellant might have to file the notice of kb_appeal with the kb_appellate_court kb_court , or with the kb_court from which the kb_appeal is taken , or both .some courts have samples of kb_a notice of kb_appeal on the kb_court 's own kb_world_wide_web site . in kb_new_jersey , for example , the kb_administration_(government) kb_office of the kb_court has promulgated kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of notice of kb_appeal for use by appellants , though using this exact kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism is not mandatory and the failure to use kb_it is not kb_a jurisdictional kb_congenital_disorder provided that all pertinent kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) is kb_set_(mythology) forth in whatever kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of notice of kb_appeal is used .the deadline for beginning an kb_appeal can often kb_beryllium very short : traditionally , kb_it is measured in days , not months . this can vary from kb_country_music to kb_country_music , as kb_water_well as within kb_a kb_country_music , depending on the specific kb_biological_rules in kb_force . in the kb_united_states_navy kb_united_states_courts_of_appeals kb_court system , criminal defendants must file kb_a notice of kb_appeal within 10 days of the kb_azerbaijan_in_the_eurovision_song_contest_2009 of either the kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition or the kb_order_(biology) kb_being appealed , or the kb_right-wing_politics to kb_appeal is forfeited .generally speaking the kb_appellate_court kb_court examines the record of kb_evidence_(law) presented in kb_the_trial kb_trial_court and kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law that the kb_lower_court kb_court kb_applied_science and decides whether that decision was legally kb_sound or not . the kb_appellate_court kb_court kb_will_and_testament typically kb_beryllium deferential to the kb_lower_court kb_court 's findings of kb_fact ( such as whether kb_a kb_defendant committed kb_a kb_particular act ) , unless clearly erroneous , and kb_sulfate kb_will_and_testament focus on the kb_court 's kb_application_(computing) of kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law to those facts ( such as whether the act found by the kb_court to have occurred fits kb_a kb_law kb_definition at issue ) .if the kb_appellate_court kb_court finds no kb_congenital_disorder , kb_it `` affirms '' the kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition . if the kb_appellate_court kb_court does find kb_a kb_law kb_congenital_disorder in the decision `` kb_#ecclesiastical_history '' ( i.e. , in the kb_lower_court kb_court ) , kb_it may `` modify '' the ruling to correct the kb_congenital_disorder , or kb_it may nullify ( `` kb_obverse_and_reverse '' or `` vacate '' ) the whole decision or any part of kb_it . kb_it may , in kb_addition , send the case back ( `` remand '' or `` remit '' ) to the kb_lower_court kb_court for further proceedings to remedy the kb_congenital_disorder .in some kb_noun_case , an kb_appellate_court kb_court may kb_review kb_a kb_lower_court kb_court decision `` kb_trial_de_novo '' ( or completely ) , challenging even the kb_lower_court kb_court 's findings of kb_fact . this might kb_beryllium the proper kb_standard_of_review of kb_review , for example , if the kb_lower_court kb_court resolved the case by granting kb_a pre-trial kb_motion_to_dismiss dismiss or kb_motion_(physics) for kb_summary_judgment kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition which is usually based only upon written submissions to kb_the_trial kb_trial_court and not on any kb_jury_trial testimony .another situation is where kb_appeal is by way of `` re-hearing '' . certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial to kb_beryllium heard afresh in the kb_appellate_court kb_court .sometimes , the kb_appellate_court kb_court finds kb_a kb_congenital_disorder in the procedure the parties used in filing the kb_appeal and dismisses the kb_appeal without considering its merits , which has the same effect as affirming the kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition kb_#ecclesiastical_history . ( this would happen , for example , if the appellant waited too kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , under the kb_appellate_court kb_court 's kb_biological_rules , to file the kb_appeal . )generally , there is no kb_jury_trial in an kb_appellate_court kb_court , only consideration of the record of the kb_evidence_(law) presented to kb_the_trial kb_trial_court and all the pre-trial and kb_trial_court proceedings are reviewed—unless the kb_appeal is by way of re-hearing , kb_new_world kb_evidence_(law) kb_will_and_testament usually only kb_beryllium considered on kb_appeal in `` very '' rare instances , for example if that kb_material kb_evidence_(law) was unavailable to kb_a party for some very significant kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving such as kb_prosecutorial_misconduct misconduct .in some kb_systems_analysis , an kb_appellate_court kb_court kb_will_and_testament only consider the written decision of the kb_lower_court kb_court , together with any written kb_evidence_(law) that was before that kb_court and is relevant to the kb_appeal . in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_systems_analysis , the kb_appellate_court kb_court kb_will_and_testament normally consider the record of the kb_lower_court kb_court . in those kb_noun_case the record kb_will_and_testament kb_first_trimester kb_beryllium certified by the kb_lower_court kb_court .the appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the kb_appeal and the appellee ( or respondent ) can present arguments against kb_it . arguments of the parties to the kb_appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers , if represented , or `` kb_pro_se se '' if the party has not engaged kb_law kb_representation_(arts) . those arguments are presented in written kb_brief_(law) and sometimes in kb_oral_argument kb_argument_of_a_function to the kb_court at kb_a kb_hearing_loss . at such hearings each party is allowed kb_a brief presentation at which the appellate kb_book_of_judges kb_amplitude-shift_keying questions based on their kb_review of the record kb_#ecclesiastical_history and the submitted kb_brief_(law) .in an kb_adversarial_system system , appellate courts do not have the kb_power_(physics) to kb_review kb_lower_court kb_court decisions unless kb_a party appeals kb_it . therefore , if kb_a kb_lower_court kb_court has ruled in an improper manner , or against kb_precedent , that kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition kb_will_and_testament stand if not appealed – even if kb_it might have been overturned on kb_appeal .the united kb_sovereign_state kb_law system generally recognizes kb_2_(number) types of appeals : kb_a kb_jury_trial `` kb_trial_de_novo '' or an kb_appeal on the record .kb_a kb_trial_de_novo novo is usually kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance for kb_review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural kb_attribute_(role-playing_games) of kb_a formal judicial kb_jury_trial . if unchallenged , these decisions have the kb_power_(physics) to settle more minor kb_law disputes once and for all . if kb_a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such kb_a kb_tribunal , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) generally has the kb_power_(physics) to request kb_a kb_jury_trial `` kb_trial_de_novo '' by kb_a kb_court_of_record record . in such kb_a proceeding , all issues and kb_evidence_(law) may kb_beryllium kb_adaptation newly , as though never heard before , and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) is not restricted to the kb_evidence_(law) heard in the lower proceeding . sometimes , however , the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as kb_evidence_(law) , thus helping to curb frivolous appeals .in some kb_noun_case , an kb_application_(computing) for `` kb_trial_de_novo novo '' effectively erases the kb_prior kb_jury_trial as if kb_it had never taken kb_place_of_articulation . the supreme kb_court of kb_virginia has stated that ' '' this kb_court has repeatedly held that the effect of an kb_appeal to circuit kb_court is to `` annul the kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition of the inferior kb_tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous kb_jury_trial . '' ' the only exception to this is that if kb_a kb_defendant appeals kb_a conviction for kb_a crime having kb_cross-platform_software levels of offenses , where they are convicted on kb_a lesser offense , the kb_appeal is of the lesser offense ; the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses . `` [ kb_a ] kb_jury_trial on the same charges in the circuit kb_court does not violate kb_double_jeopardy jeopardy principles , . . . kb_grammatical_subject only to the limitation that conviction in [ the ] kb_united_states_territorial_court for an offense lesser included in the kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_electric_charge constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense ,permitting kb_trial_de_novo novo in the circuit kb_court only for the lesser-included offense . ''in an kb_appeal on the record from kb_a decision in kb_a judicial proceeding , both appellant and respondent are kb_bound_morpheme to kb_base_(chemistry) their arguments wholly on the proceedings and kb_human_body of kb_evidence_(law) as they were presented in the lower kb_tribunal . each seeks to prove to the higher kb_court that the result they desired was the just result . kb_stare_decisis and kb_case_law kb_law kb_female_body_shape prominently in the arguments . in kb_order_(biology) for the kb_appeal to succeed , the appellant must prove that the kb_lower_court kb_court committed kb_reversible_error , that is , an impermissible action by the kb_court acted to cause kb_a result that was unjust , and which would not have resulted had the kb_court acted properly . some examples of kb_reversible_error would kb_beryllium erroneously instructing the kb_jury on kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law applicable to the case , permitting seriously kb_improper_argument kb_argument_of_a_function by an attorney , admitting or excluding kb_evidence_(law) improperly , acting outside the kb_court 's kb_jurisdiction , injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to kb_women's_suffrage kb_sulfate , juror misconduct , etc . the failure to formally kb_space_debris at the kb_time_(magazine) , to what kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) views as improper action in the kb_lower_court kb_court , may result in the affirmance of the kb_lower_court kb_court 's kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition on the grounds that kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) did not `` preserve the issue for kb_appeal '' by objecting .in kb_noun_case where kb_a judge rather than kb_a kb_jury decided issues of kb_fact , an kb_appellate_court kb_court kb_will_and_testament apply an `` kb_abuse_of_discretion of discretion '' kb_standard_of_review of kb_review . under this standard , the kb_appellate_court kb_court gives deference to the kb_lower_court kb_court 's view of the kb_evidence_(law) , and reverses its decision only if kb_it were kb_a clear kb_abuse_of_discretion of discretion . this is usually kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as kb_a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness . on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , the kb_appellate_court kb_court normally gives less deference to kb_a kb_lower_court kb_court 's decision on issues of kb_law , and may kb_obverse_and_reverse if kb_it finds that the kb_lower_court kb_court kb_applied_science the wrong kb_law standard .in some kb_noun_case , an appellant may successfully argue that kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law under which the lower decision was rendered was kb_constitutionality or otherwise invalid , or may convince the higher kb_court to kb_order_(biology) kb_a kb_new_world kb_jury_trial on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) that kb_evidence_(law) kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet sought was concealed or only recently discovered . in the case of kb_new_world kb_evidence_(law) , there must kb_beryllium kb_a kb_high_middle_ages kb_probability that its presence or absence would have made kb_a kb_material difference in kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial . another issue suitable for kb_appeal in criminal kb_noun_case is effective assistance of counsel . if kb_a kb_defendant has been convicted and can prove that kb_histidine kb_lawyer did not adequately handle kb_histidine case and that there is kb_a reasonable kb_probability that the result of kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial would have been different had the kb_lawyer given competent kb_representation_(arts) , kb_he_(letter) is entitled to kb_a kb_new_world kb_jury_trial .kb_a kb_lawyer traditionally starts an kb_oral_argument kb_argument_of_a_function to any kb_appellate_court kb_court with the kb_lexical_semantics `` may kb_it please the kb_court .

accept kb_a kb_guilt_(law) plea . during the kb_hearing_loss , the judge assesses the offense , the mitigating factors , and the kb_defendant 's kb_character_(computing) , and passes kb_sentence_(law) .if the kb_defendant pleads kb_plea#guilty_and_not_guilty_pleas kb_guilt_(law) , kb_a date is kb_set_(mythology) for kb_a kb_preliminary_hearing kb_hearing_loss or kb_a kb_jury_trial .in the kb_past ,

kb_world_health_organization refuses to enter kb_a plea . the rationale for this is the kb_defendant 's kb_right_to_silence silence .this is also often the stage at which arguments for or against

kb_nato_training_mission-afghanistan trip to kb_colorado_springs,_colorado , kb_colorado , to teach kb_a short summer kb_school session at kb_colorado_college . several of the sights on her trip

of the future contained within its gleaming kb_white_american kb_buildings ; the kb_wheat fields of kb_americas 's heartland kb_kansas , through which her kb_nato_training_mission-afghanistan was

was generally considered the best kb_music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today . just as kb_billy_bates had been inspired to write her poem , ward , too , was inspired . the tune came to him while kb_he_(letter) was on kb_a ferryboat trip from kb_coney_island kb_island back to kb_histidine home in kb_new_york_city after kb_a leisurely summer day and kb_he_(letter) immediately wrote

'' . ward 's kb_music combined with kb_billy_bates 's poem were kb_first_trimester published together in 1910 and titled `` kb_americas the beautiful '' .ward died in 1903 , not knowing the national stature kb_histidine kb_music would attain since the kb_music was only kb_first_trimester kb_applied_science to the song in 1904. kb_billy_bates was more fortunate since the song 's popularity was kb_water_well established by the kb_time_(magazine) of her kb_death in 1929 .at various times in the more than 100 years that have elapsed since the song was written , particularly during the

( incidentally , this allows use with kb_a kb_hexadecimal kb_numeral_system system , which was used for traditional kb_chinese_characters measures of weight . ) instead of running on wires as in the kb_chinese_characters , kb_korean_language , and kb_japanese_film models , the beads of kb_roman_empire kb_rutherford_model run in grooves , presumably making kb_arithmetic calculations much slower .another possible source of the `` kb_suanpan '' is kb_chinese_characters kb_counting_rods kb_rod_cell , which operated with kb_a kb_decimal but lacked the kb_concept of kb_0_(number) as kb_a kb_place_of_articulation holder . the kb_0_(number) was probably introduced to the kb_chinese_characters in the kb_tang_dynasty ( 618–907 ) when kb_air_travel in the kb_indian_ocean and the kb_middle_east kb_east_africa would have provided direct contact with kb_indian_subcontinent , allowing them to acquire the kb_concept of kb_0_(number) and the kb_decimal_pointthe normal method of kb_calculation in kb_ancient_rome , as in kb_greece , was by moving counters on kb_a smooth table . originally pebbles ( `` calculi '' ) were used . later , and in kb_middle_ages , jetons were manufactured . marked lines indicated units , fives , tens etc . as in the kb_roman_numeral system . this system of 'counter casting ' continued into the late kb_roman_empire and in kb_middle_ages , and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century . due to kb_pope_sylvester_ii ii 's reintroduction of the abacus with modifications , kb_it became widely used in kb_europe once again during the 11th century this abacus used beads on wires , unlike the traditional kb_roman_empire counting boards , which meant the abacus could kb_beryllium used much faster .writing in the 1st century bc , kb_horace refers to the kb_beeswax abacus , kb_a board covered with kb_a thin layer of kb_black_sea kb_beeswax on which columns and figures were kb_inscribed_figure using kb_a stylus .kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) example of kb_archaeology kb_evidence_(law) of the kb_roman_abacus , shown here in kb_reconstruction_era , dates to the 1st century kb_anno_domini . kb_it has eight kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or no beads in each . the groove marked kb_iodine indicates units , x tens , and kb_sulfate on up to millions . the beads in the shorter grooves denote fives –five units , five tens etc. , essentially in kb_a kb_bi-quinary_coded_decimal coded kb_decimal , related to the kb_roman_numerals . the short grooves on the kb_right-wing_politics may have been used for marking kb_roman_empire `` ounces '' ( i.e . kb_egyptian_fraction ) .the kb_decimal kb_grammatical_number system invented in kb_indian_subcontinent replaced the abacus in kb_western_europe .the `` kb_abhidharmakośabhāṣya '' of kb_vasubandhu ( 316-396 ) , kb_a kb_sanskrit kb_cold_working on kb_buddhist_philosophy , says that the second-century kb_council_of_europe kb_philosophy kb_vasumitrain kb_japanese_film , the abacus is called `` kb_soroban '' ( , lit . `` counting tray '' ) , imported from kb_china in the 14th century . kb_it was probably in use by the working kb_class_(biology) kb_a century or more before the kb_ruling_class kb_class_(biology) started , as the kb_class_(biology) kb_structure did not allow for devices used by the lower kb_class_(biology) to kb_beryllium kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome or used by the kb_ruling_class kb_class_(biology) . the 1/4 abacus , which is suited to kb_decimal kb_calculation popular appeared circa 1930 , and became widespread as the kb_japanese_film abandoned kb_hexadecimal weight kb_calculation which was still common in kb_china .today 's kb_japanese_film abacus is kb_a 1:4 kb_type_(biology) , four-bead abacus was introduced from kb_china in the muromachi era . kb_it adopts the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of the kb_upper_egypt deck kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) bead and the bottom four beads . the top bead on the kb_upper_egypt deck was equal to five and the bottom kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) is equal to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) like the kb_chinese_characters or kb_korean_language abacus , and the kb_decimal kb_grammatical_number can kb_beryllium expressed , kb_sulfate the abacus is kb_aircraft_design_process as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) four abacus . the beads are always in the kb_shape of kb_a kb_diamond . the kb_quotient_ring kb_division_(mathematics) is generally used instead of the kb_division_(mathematics) method ; at the same kb_time_(magazine) , in kb_order_(biology) to make the kb_multiplication and kb_division_(mathematics) digits consistently use the kb_division_(mathematics) kb_multiplication . later , kb_japan had kb_a 3:5 abacus called天三算盤 , which is now the ize rongji kb_class_(set_theory) of shansi village in yamagata kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey . there were also had 2:5 beads abacus .with the four-bead abacus kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) , kb_it is also common to use kb_japanese_film abacus around the kb_world_war_ii . there are also improved kb_japanese_film abacus in various places . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the japanese-made abacus made in kb_china is an aluminum frame kb_plastic bead abacus . the file is kb_next to the four beads , and the `` clearing '' kb_button_(control) , kb_news_media the clearing kb_button_(control) , immediately put the kb_upper_egypt bead to the kb_upper_egypt kb_positional_notation , the lower bead is dialed to the lower kb_positional_notation , immediately clearing , easy to use .the abacus is still manufactured in kb_japan today even with the proliferation , practicality , and affordability of pocket kb_electronic_computer calculators . the use of the kb_soroban is still taught in kb_japanese_film kb_primary_education schools as part of kb_mathematics , primarily as an kb_aid to faster kb_mental_health kb_calculation . using visual kb_imagery of kb_a kb_soroban , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) can arrive at the answer in the same kb_time_(magazine) as , or even faster than , is possible with kb_a kb_health instrument .the kb_chinese_characters abacus migrated from kb_china to kb_koreasome sources mention the use of an abacus called kb_a `` nepohualtzintzin '' in kb_ancient_history kb_aztec kb_albanian_culture . this mesoamerican abacus used kb_a 5-digit base-20 system .kb_the_word_(free_love) word nepōhualtzintzin comes from kb_nahuatl and kb_it is formed by the kb_semitic_root ; `` kb_[neon '' – kb_personal_property - ; `` pōhual '' or `` pōhualli '' – the account - ; and `` tzintzin '' – small similar kb_chemical_element . its complete kb_meaning_(linguistics) was taken as : counting with small similar kb_chemical_element by somebody . its use was taught in the kb_calmecac to the `` temalpouhqueh '' , kb_world_health_organization were students dedicated to kb_take the accounts of skies , from kb_childhood .the nepōhualtzintzin was divided in kb_2_(number) main parts separated by kb_a bar or intermediate cord . in the kb_left-wing_politics part there were four beads , which in the kb_first_trimester row have kb_unitary_state values ( 1 , kb_alkaline_earth_metal , 3 , and 4 ) , and in the kb_right-wing_politics side there are kb_triliteral beads with values of 5 , 10 , and 15 respectively . in kb_order_(biology) to know the kb_lightness of the respective beads of the kb_upper_egypt rows , kb_it is enough to multiply by 20 ( by each row ) , the kb_lightness of the corresponding account in the kb_first_trimester row .altogether , there were kb_boron_group rows with 7 beads in each kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) , which made up 91 beads in each nepōhualtzintzin . this was kb_a kb_base_(chemistry) kb_grammatical_number to kb_natural_language_understanding , 7 times kb_boron_group , kb_a close relation conceived between kb_natural_number kb_phenomenon , the kb_underworld and the kb_cycle_(graph_theory) of the heavens . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) nepōhualtzintzin ( 91 ) represented the kb_grammatical_number of days that kb_a kb_season of the year lasts , kb_2_(number) nepōhualtzitzin ( 182 ) is the kb_grammatical_number of days of the kb_corn 's cycle , from its sowing to its kb_harvest , kb_triliteral nepōhualtzintzin ( 273 ) is the kb_grammatical_number of days of kb_a baby 's kb_gestation , and four nepōhualtzintzin ( 364 ) completed kb_cyclic_compound and approximate kb_a year ( 1 days short ) . when translated into kb_modern_history kb_apollo_guidance_computer kb_arithmetic , the nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the kb_18-point_agreement in kb_floating_point point , which calculated stellar as kb_water_well as infinitesimal amounts with kb_absolute_morality kb_precision_(arithmetic) , meant that no round off was allowed .the rediscovery of the nepōhualtzintzin was due to the kb_mexican_people kb_civil_engineering kb_jacques-louis_david esparza kb_944_hidalgo , kb_world_health_organization in kb_histidine wanderings throughout kb_mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in kb_gold , jade , encrustations of kb_electron_shell , etc . there have also been found very kb_old_testament nepōhualtzintzin attributed to the kb_olmec kb_albanian_culture , and even some bracelets of mayan kb_evolution , as kb_water_well as kb_a diversity of kb_theory_of_forms and materials in kb_other_(philosophy) cultures .kb_lake_george_(new_york) i. sanchez , `` kb_arithmetic in kb_maya_civilization '' , austin-texas , 1961 found another kb_base_(chemistry) 5 , kb_base_(chemistry) 4 abacus in the kb_yucatán_peninsula kb_peninsula that also computed calendar kb_big_data . this was kb_a finger abacus , on kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_hand 0 , 1 , kb_alkaline_earth_metal , 3 , and 4 were used ; and on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand 0 , 1 , kb_alkaline_earth_metal and 3 were used . note the use of kb_0_(number) at kb_operation_barbarossa beginning and end of the kb_2_(number) kb_cycle_(graph_theory) . sanchez worked with kb_sylvanus_morley morley , kb_a noted mayanist .the kb_quipu of the incas was kb_a system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical kb_big_data , like advanced tally sticks – but not used to perform calculations . calculations were carried out using kb_a kb_yupana ( kb_quechua_languages for `` counting kb_tool '' ; kb_episcopal_see kb_female_body_shape ) which was still in use after the kb_umayyad_conquest_of_hispania of kb_peru . the working kb_principle_(chemistry) of kb_a kb_yupana is unknown , but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of these instruments was kb_anatolian_hypothesis by kb_italian_language kb_mathematician nicolino kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann pasquale . by comparing the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of several yupanas , researchers found that calculations were based using the kb_fibonacci_sequence sequencethe kb_russian_alphabet abacus , the `` schoty '' ( счёты ) , usually has kb_a kb_single_bond slanted deck , with ten beads on each wire ( except kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) wire , usually positioned near the kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) , with four beads for quarter-ruble kb_egyptian_fraction ) . older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks , which were minted until 1916. the kb_russian_alphabet abacus is often used kb_vertical_direction , with wires from kb_left_to_right kb_right-wing_politics in the manner of kb_a book . the wires are usually bowed to kb_bulge_(astronomy) upward in the center , to keep the beads pinned to either of the kb_2_(number) sides . kb_it is cleared when all the beads are moved to the kb_right-wing_politics . during manipulation , beads are moved to the kb_left-wing_politics . for easy viewing , the middle kb_alkaline_earth_metal beads on each wire ( the 5th and 6th bead ) usually are of kb_a different kb_color from the kb_other_(philosophy) eight beads . likewise , the kb_left-wing_politics bead of the thousands wire ( and the million wire , if present ) may have kb_a different kb_color .as kb_a kb_simple_polygon , cheap and reliable kb_analyzer , the kb_russian_alphabet abacus was in use in all shops and kb_market_(economics) throughout the kb_commonwealth_of_independent_states kb_soviet_union , and the usage of kb_it was taught in most schools until the 1990s . even the 1874 invention of kb_mechanical_calculator , kb_odhner_arithmometer arithmometer , had not replaced them in kb_russian_empire and likewise the kb_mass_production of felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the kb_soviet_union . the kb_russian_alphabet abacus began to lose popularity only after the kb_mass_production of kb_pocket_calculator had started in the kb_soviet_union in 1974. today kb_it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld kb_calculator .the kb_russian_alphabet abacus was brought to kb_france around 1820 by the kb_mathematician kb_jean-victor_poncelet poncelet , kb_world_health_organization served in kb_napoleon 's kb_british_army and had been kb_a prisoner of kb_war in kb_russian_empire . the abacus had fallen out of use in kb_western_europe in the 16th century with the rise of kb_decimal notation and algorismic methods . to poncelet 's kb_france contemporaries , kb_it was something kb_new_world . poncelet used kb_it , not for any kb_applied_science purpose , but as kb_a teaching and demonstration kb_aid . the kb_ottoman_empire and the kb_armenian_languagearound the kb_world_war_ii , abacuses have been used in pre-schools and kb_elementary_school schools as an kb_aid in teaching the kb_numeral_system system and kb_arithmetic .in kb_western_world , kb_a bead frame similar to the kb_russian_alphabet abacus but with straight wires and kb_a vertical frame has been common ( kb_episcopal_see image ) . kb_it is still often seen as kb_a kb_plastic or wooden toy .the wire frame may kb_beryllium used either with positional notation like kb_other_(philosophy) abacuses ( thus the 10-wire version may represent kb_grammatical_number up to 9,999,999,999 ) , or each bead may represent kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_units_of_measurement ( kb_sulfate that e.g . 74 can kb_beryllium represented by shifting all beads on 7 wires and 4 beads on the 8th wire , kb_sulfate kb_grammatical_number up to 100 may kb_beryllium represented ) . in the bead frame shown , the gap between the 5th and 6th wire , corresponding to the kb_color change between the 5th and the 6th bead on each wire , suggests the latter use .the red-and-white abacus is used in contemporary kb_primary_education schools for kb_a wide range of number-related lessons . the twenty bead version , referred to by its kb_dutch_language kb_toponymy `` rekenrek '' ( `` calculating frame '' ) , is often used , sometimes on kb_a string of beads , sometimes on kb_a kb_rigid_airship framework .by kb_learning how to calculate with abacus , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) can improve kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's kb_mental_health kb_calculation which becomes faster and more accurate in doing kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number calculations . kb_mental_abacus kb_mental_health kb_calculation ( amc ) was kb_derived_trait from the abacus which means doing kb_calculation , including kb_addition , kb_subtraction , kb_multiplication , and kb_division_(mathematics) , in kb_mind with an imagined abacus . kb_it is kb_a kb_high-level_programming_language cognitive skill that run through calculations with an effective kb_algorithm . kb_people_(american_magazine) doing long-term amc kb_military_education_and_training show higher numerical kb_memory capacity and have more effectively connected neural pathways . they are able to retrieve kb_memory to deal with kb_complex_number processes to calculate . the kb_fish_processing of amc involves both the kb_visuospatial_function and visuomotor kb_fish_processing which generate the visual abacus and perform the kb_movement_(sign_language) of the imaginary bead . since the only kb_object_(philosophy) needed to kb_beryllium remembered is the finial kb_positional_notation of beads , kb_it takes less kb_memory and less kb_computation kb_time_(magazine) .an adapted abacus , invented by tim cranmer , called kb_a cranmer abacus is still commonly used by individuals kb_world_health_organization are kb_blindness . kb_a piece of kb_hardness fabric or kb_rubber is placed behind the beads kb_sulfate that they do not move inadvertently . this keeps the beads in kb_place_of_articulation while the users kb_sentience or manipulate them . they use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions kb_multiplication , kb_division_(mathematics) , kb_addition , kb_subtraction , kb_square_root and kb_cube_root kb_root_of_a_function .although kb_blindness students have benefited from talking calculators , the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early kb_grade_(education) , both in kb_state_school schools and kb_state_of_matter schools for the kb_blindness . kb_blindness students also complete mathematical assignments using kb_a braille-writer and kb_nemeth_braille kb_code ( kb_a kb_type_(biology) of kb_braille kb_code for kb_mathematics )

forming kb_a kb_covalent_bond with an kb_lone_pair ( kb_a kb_lewis_acid ) .the kb_first_trimester category of acids is the kb_proton donors or kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted acids . in the special case of kb_aqueous_solutions solutions , kb_proton donors kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_hydronium_ion kb_water and are known as kb_acid-base_reaction#arrhenius_theory acids . kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted and kb_thomas_martin_lowry generalized the arrhenius kb_theory to include non-aqueous solvents . kb_a kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted or arrhenius kb_acid usually contains kb_a kb_hydrogen_atom bonded to kb_a kb_chemical_structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of kb_hydrogen .aqueous kb_acid-base_reaction#arrhenius_theory acids have kb_characteristic_(algebra) kb_chemical_property which provide kb_a practical description of an kb_acid . acids kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_aqueous_solutions solutions with kb_a sour taste , can kb_turn_(geometry) blue kb_litmus kb_red_fox , and react with kb_base_(chemistry) and certain metals ( like kb_calcium ) to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_salt_(chemistry) . kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_acid '' is kb_derived_trait from the kb_latin `` acidus/acēre '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` sour '' . an kb_aqueous_solution kb_solid_solution of an kb_acid has kb_a kb_ph less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid ' ( as in 'dissolved in kb_acid ' ) , while the strict kb_definition refers only to the kb_solution . kb_a lower kb_ph means kb_a higher acidity , and thus kb_a higher kb_concentration of kb_hydron_(chemistry) kb_ions in the kb_solid_solution . kb_chemical_substance or substances having the kb_property of an kb_acid are said to kb_beryllium acidic .common aqueous acids include kb_hydrochloric_acid kb_acid ( kb_a kb_solid_solution of kb_hydrogen_chloride which is found in kb_gastric_acid kb_acid in the kb_stomach and activates kb_digestive_enzymes ) , acetic kb_acid ( kb_vinegar is kb_a dilute kb_aqueous_solution kb_solid_solution of this kb_liquid ) , kb_sulfuric_acid ( used in kb_car_batteries ) , and citric kb_acid ( found in citrus fruits ) . as these examples show , acids ( in the colloquial kb_word_sense ) can kb_beryllium solutions or pure substances , and can kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from acids ( in the strict kb_word_sense ) that are solids , liquids , or gases . kb_strong_nuclear_force acids and some concentrated weak acids are kb_corrosive_substance , but there are kb_non-linear_writing such as carboranes and kb_boric_acid kb_acid .the kb_second_language category of acids are kb_lewis_acids_and_bases , which kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_covalent_bond with an kb_lone_pair . an example is kb_boron_trifluoride ( bf ) , whose kb_boron kb_atom has kb_a vacant kb_atomic_orbital which can kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_covalent_bond by sharing kb_a kb_lone_pair pair of electrons on an kb_atom in kb_a kb_base_(chemistry) , for example the kb_nitrogen kb_atom in kb_ammonia ( nh ) . kb_meriwether_lewis considered this as kb_a generalization of the kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted kb_definition , kb_sulfate that an kb_acid is kb_a kb_protein_sequencing kb_species that accepts kb_electron pairs either directly `` or '' by releasing kb_protons ( kb_hydrogen ) into the kb_solid_solution , which then accept kb_electron pairs . however , kb_hydrogen_chloride , acetic kb_acid , and most kb_other_(philosophy) brønsted-lowry acids can not kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_covalent_bond with an kb_lone_pair and are therefore not kb_lewis_acids_and_bases . conversely , many kb_lewis_acids_and_bases are not arrhenius or brønsted-lowry acids . in kb_modern_history terminology , an `` kb_acid '' is implicitly kb_a kb_brønsted–lowry_acid–base_theory and not kb_a kb_lewis_acid , since chemists almost always refer to kb_a kb_lewis_acid explicitly as `` kb_a kb_lewis_acid '' .kb_modern_history definitions are concerned with the fundamental kb_protein_sequencing reactions common to all acids .most acids encountered in everyday kb_life_(magazine) are kb_aqueous_solutions solutions , or can kb_beryllium kb_fall_of_communism_in_albania in kb_water , kb_sulfate the arrhenius and brønsted-lowry definitions are the most relevant .the brønsted-lowry kb_definition is the most widely used kb_definition ; unless otherwise specified , acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of kb_a kb_proton ( kb_hydrogen ) from an kb_acid to kb_a kb_base_(chemistry) .kb_hydronium kb_ions are acids according to all kb_triliteral definitions . although alcohols and amines can kb_beryllium brønsted-lowry acids , they can also kb_function_(biology) as kb_meriwether_lewis kb_base_(chemistry)the kb_sweden chemist kb_svante_arrhenius arrhenius attributed the kb_chemical_property of acidity to kb_hydron_(chemistry) ( kb_hydrogen ) or kb_protons in 1884. an arrhenius kb_acid is kb_a kb_matter that , when added to kb_water , increases the kb_concentration of kb_hydrogen kb_ions in the kb_water . note that chemists often write kb_hydrogen ( `` aq '' ) and refer to the kb_hydrogen_ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free kb_hydrogen kb_atomic_nucleus , kb_a kb_proton , does not exist alone in kb_water , kb_it exists as the kb_hydronium_ion , kb_water . thus , an arrhenius kb_acid can also kb_beryllium described as kb_a kb_matter that increases the kb_concentration of kb_hydronium kb_ions when added to kb_water . examples include kb_molecular_genetics substances such as hcl and acetic kb_acid .an arrhenius kb_base_(chemistry) , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , is kb_a kb_matter which increases the kb_concentration of kb_lithium_hydroxide ( kb_hydroxide ) kb_ions when kb_fall_of_communism_in_albania in kb_water . this decreases the kb_concentration of kb_hydronium because the kb_ions react to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_water molecules :kb_water + kb_hydroxide ⇌ kb_water + kb_waterdue to this kb_chemical_equilibrium , any increase in the kb_concentration of kb_hydronium is accompanied by kb_a decrease in the kb_concentration of kb_lithium_hydroxide . thus , an arrhenius kb_acid could also kb_beryllium said to kb_beryllium kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) that decreases kb_lithium_hydroxide kb_concentration , while an arrhenius kb_base_(chemistry) increases kb_it .in an acidic kb_solid_solution , the kb_concentration of kb_hydronium kb_ions is greater than 10 kb_mole_(unit)while the arrhenius kb_concept is useful for describing many reactions , kb_it is also quite limited in its kb_scope_(mouthwash) . in 1923 chemists kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted nicolaus kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted and kb_thomas_martin_lowry kb_thomas_martin_lowry independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of kb_a kb_proton . kb_a brønsted-lowry kb_acid ( or simply kb_brønsted–lowry_acid–base_theory ) is kb_a kb_species that donates kb_a kb_proton to kb_a brønsted-lowry kb_base_(chemistry) . brønsted-lowry acid-base kb_theory has several advantages over arrhenius kb_theory . consider the following reactions of acetic kb_acid ( chcooh ) , the kb_organic_chemistry kb_acid that gives kb_vinegar its kb_characteristic_(algebra) taste :both kb_theories easily describe the kb_first_trimester reaction : chcooh acts as an arrhenius kb_acid because kb_it acts as kb_a source of kb_water when kb_fall_of_communism_in_albania in kb_water , and kb_it acts as kb_a kb_brønsted–lowry_acid–base_theory by donating kb_a kb_proton to kb_water . in the kb_second_language example chcooh undergoes the same transformation , in this case donating kb_a kb_proton to kb_ammonia ( nh ) , but does not relate to the arrhenius kb_definition of an kb_acid because the reaction does not produce kb_hydronium . nevertheless , chcooh is both an arrhenius and kb_a brønsted-lowry kb_acid .brønsted-lowry kb_theory can kb_beryllium used to describe reactions of kb_molecule in nonaqueous kb_solid_solution or the kb_gas kb_phase_(matter) . kb_hydrogen_chloride ( hcl ) and kb_ammonia combine under several different conditions to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_ammonium_chloride , nhcl . in kb_aqueous_solution kb_solid_solution hcl behaves as kb_hydrochloric_acid kb_acid and exists as kb_hydronium and kb_chloride kb_ions . the following reactions illustrate the limitations of arrhenius 's kb_definition :as with the acetic kb_acid reactions , both definitions kb_cold_working for the kb_first_trimester example , where kb_water is the kb_solvent and kb_hydronium_ion is formed by the hcl kb_solution . the kb_next kb_2_(number) reactions do not involve the formation of kb_ions but are still proton-transfer reactions . in the kb_second_language reaction kb_hydrogen_chloride and kb_ammonia ( kb_fall_of_communism_in_albania in kb_benzene ) react to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_solid kb_ammonium_chloride in kb_a kb_benzene kb_solvent and in the kb_ipad_(third_generation) gaseous hcl and nh combine to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_solid .kb_a kb_ipad_(third_generation) , only marginally related kb_concept was kb_anatolian_hypothesis in 1923 by kb_gilbert_n._lewis kb_noun kb_meriwether_lewis , which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve kb_a kb_proton transfer . kb_a kb_lewis_acid is kb_a kb_species that accepts kb_a pair of electrons from another kb_species ; in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_lexical_semantics , kb_it is an kb_lone_pair acceptor . kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted acid-base reactions are kb_proton transfer reactions while kb_meriwether_lewis acid-base reactions are kb_lone_pair transfers . many kb_lewis_acids_and_bases are not brønsted-lowry acids . kb_contrast_(vision) how the following reactions are described in terms of kb_acid-base_chemistry kb_chemistry :in the kb_first_trimester reaction kb_a kb_fluoride , kb_fluorine , gives up an kb_lone_pair to kb_boron_trifluoride to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_decay_product kb_tetrafluoroborate . kb_fluoride `` loses '' kb_a pair of valence electrons because the electrons shared in the b—f kb_chemical_bond are located in the kb_region of kb_space between the kb_2_(number) kb_atomic_nucleus and are therefore more distant from the kb_fluoride kb_atomic_nucleus than they are in the lone kb_fluoride . bf is kb_a kb_lewis_acid because kb_it accepts the kb_lone_pair from kb_fluoride . this reaction can not kb_beryllium described in terms of kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted kb_theory because there is no kb_proton transfer . the kb_second_language reaction can kb_beryllium described using either kb_theory . kb_a kb_proton is transferred from an unspecified kb_brønsted–lowry_acid–base_theory to kb_ammonia , kb_a kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted kb_base_(chemistry) ; alternatively , kb_ammonia acts as kb_a kb_lewis_base and transfers kb_a kb_lone_pair pair of electrons to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_chemical_bond with kb_a kb_hydrogen_ion . the kb_species that gains the kb_lone_pair is the kb_lewis_acid ; for example , the kb_oxygen kb_atom in kb_water gains kb_a pair of electrons when kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the h—o bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the kb_chemical_bond become localized on kb_oxygen . depending on the kb_context_(language_use) , kb_a kb_lewis_acid may also kb_beryllium described as an kb_nitrogen_tetroxide or an kb_electrophile . kb_organic_chemistry kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted acids , such as acetic , citric , or oxalic kb_acid , are not kb_lewis_acids_and_bases . they dissociate in kb_water to produce kb_a kb_lewis_acid , kb_hydrogen , but at the same kb_time_(magazine) also yield an equal amount of kb_a kb_lewis_base ( kb_acetate , kb_citrate , or kb_oxalate , respectively , for the acids mentioned ) . few , if any , of the acids discussed in the following are kb_lewis_acids_and_bases .reactions of acids are often generalized in the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism ha kb_hydrogen + kb_a , where ha represents the kb_acid and kb_a is the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) . this reaction is referred to as protolysis . the kb_protonated kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism ( ha ) of an kb_acid is also sometimes referred to as the free kb_acid .acid-base conjugate pairs differ by kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton , and can kb_beryllium interconverted by the kb_addition or removal of kb_a kb_proton ( kb_protonation and kb_deprotonation , respectively ) . note that the kb_acid can kb_beryllium the kb_electric_charge kb_species and the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) can kb_beryllium kb_neutral_solution in which case the generalized reaction scheme could kb_beryllium written as ha kb_hydrogen + a. in kb_solid_solution there exists an kb_chemical_equilibrium between the kb_acid and its kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) . the kb_equilibrium_constant `` kb_potassium '' is an expression of the kb_chemical_equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the kb_ions in kb_solid_solution . brackets indicate kb_concentration , such that [ kb_water ] means `` the kb_concentration of kb_water '' . the kb_acid_dissociation_constant constant `` kb_potassium '' is generally used in the kb_context_(language_use) of acid-base reactions . the numerical kb_lightness of `` kb_potassium '' is equal to the kb_decay_product of the concentrations of the products divided by the kb_concentration of the reactants , where the reactant is the kb_acid ( ha ) and the products are the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) and kb_hydrogen .the stronger of kb_2_(number) acids kb_will_and_testament have kb_a higher `` kb_potassium '' than the weaker kb_acid ; the kb_ratio of kb_hydron_(chemistry) to kb_acid kb_will_and_testament kb_beryllium higher for the stronger kb_acid as the stronger kb_acid has kb_a greater tendency to lose its kb_proton . because the range of possible values for `` kb_potassium '' spans many kb_order_(biology) of kb_apparent_magnitude , kb_a more manageable constant , p '' kb_potassium '' is more frequently used , where p '' kb_potassium '' = −log `` kb_potassium '' . stronger acids have kb_a smaller p '' kb_potassium '' than weaker acids . experimentally determined p '' kb_potassium '' at 25 °c in kb_aqueous_solution kb_solid_solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference kb_material .in the kb_classical_conditioning naming system , acids are kb_english_alphabet#letter_names according to their anions . that kb_ionic_crystal kb_suffix is dropped and replaced with kb_a kb_new_world kb_suffix ( and sometimes kb_prefix ) , according to the table kb_#ecclesiastical_history .for example , hcl has kb_chloride as its kb_anion , kb_sulfate the -ide kb_suffix makes kb_it kb_take the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_hydrochloric_acid kb_acid . in the kb_international_union_of_pure_and_applied_chemistry naming system , `` aqueous '' is simply added to the kb_toponymy of the kb_ionic_compound . thus , for kb_hydrogen_chloride , the kb_international_union_of_pure_and_applied_chemistry kb_toponymy would kb_beryllium aqueous kb_hydrogen_chloride . the kb_prefix `` hydro- '' is added only if the kb_acid is made up of just kb_hydrogen and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_other_(philosophy) kb_chemical_element .kb_classical_conditioning naming system :the kb_strength_of_materials of an kb_acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose kb_a kb_proton . kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_acid is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) that completely dissociates in kb_water ; in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_lexical_semantics , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_mole_(unit) of kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_acid ha kb_dissolve_(filmmaking) in kb_water yielding kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_mole_(unit) of kb_hydrogen and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_mole_(unit) of the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) , kb_a , and kb_none_(liturgy) of the kb_protonated kb_acid ha . in kb_contrast_(vision) , kb_a kb_weak_acid kb_acid only partially dissociates and at kb_chemical_equilibrium both the kb_acid and the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) are in kb_solid_solution . examples of kb_strong_nuclear_force acids are kb_hydrochloric_acid kb_acid ( hcl ) , kb_hydroiodic_acid kb_acid ( hi ) , kb_hydrobromic_acid kb_acid ( hbr ) , kb_perchloric_acid kb_acid ( hclo ) , kb_nitric_acid kb_acid ( hno ) and kb_sulfuric_acid ( hso ) . in kb_water each of these essentially ionizes 100 % . the stronger an kb_acid is , the more easily kb_it loses kb_a kb_proton , h. kb_2_(number) kb_key_(cryptography) factors that contribute to the ease of kb_deprotonation are the kb_chemical_polarity of the h—a kb_chemical_bond and the size of kb_atom kb_a , which determines the kb_strength_of_materials of the h—a kb_chemical_bond . kb_acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) .stronger acids have kb_a larger `` kb_potassium '' and kb_a more kb_negative_number p '' kb_potassium '' than weaker acids .sulfonic acids , which are kb_organic_chemistry oxyacids , are kb_a kb_class_(biology) of kb_strong_nuclear_force acids . kb_a common example is kb_toluenesulfonic_acid kb_acid ( tosylic kb_acid ) . unlike kb_sulfuric_acid itself , sulfonic acids can kb_beryllium solids . in kb_fact , kb_polystyrene functionalized into kb_polystyrene sulfonate is kb_a kb_solid strongly acidic kb_plastic that is filterable .superacids are acids stronger than 100 % kb_sulfuric_acid . examples of superacids are kb_fluoroantimonic_acid kb_acid , kb_magic_(supernatural) kb_acid and kb_perchloric_acid kb_acid . superacids can permanently protonate kb_water to give kb_ionic_crystal , crystalline kb_hydronium `` kb_salt_(chemistry) '' . they can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations .while `` kb_potassium '' measures the kb_strength_of_materials of an kb_acid kb_chemical_compound , the kb_strength_of_materials of an aqueous kb_acid kb_solid_solution is measured by kb_ph , which is an indication of the kb_concentration of kb_hydronium in the kb_solid_solution . the kb_ph of kb_a kb_simple_polygon kb_solid_solution of an kb_acid kb_chemical_compound in kb_water is determined by the dilution of the kb_chemical_compound and the kb_chemical_compound 's `` kb_potassium '' .monoprotic acids , also known as monobasic acids , are those acids that are able to donate kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton per kb_molecule during the process of kb_dissociation_(chemistry) ( sometimes called kb_ionization ) as shown kb_#ecclesiastical_history ( symbolized by ha ) :common examples of monoprotic acids in kb_mineral_reserve acids include kb_hydrochloric_acid kb_acid ( hcl ) and kb_nitric_acid kb_acid ( hno ) . on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , for kb_organic_acids the kb_terminology mainly indicates the presence of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_carboxylic_acid kb_acid kb_group_(periodic_table) and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic kb_acid . examples in kb_organic_acids include kb_formic_acid kb_acid ( hcooh ) , acetic kb_acid ( chcooh ) and kb_benzoic_acid kb_acid ( chcooh ) .polyprotic acids , also known as polybasic acids , are able to donate more than kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton per kb_acid kb_molecule , in kb_contrast_(vision) to monoprotic acids that only donate kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton per kb_molecule . specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names , such as diprotic ( or dibasic ) kb_acid ( kb_2_(number) potential kb_protons to donate ) , and triprotic ( or tribasic ) kb_acid ( kb_triliteral potential kb_protons to donate ) .kb_a diprotic kb_acid ( here symbolized by ha ) can undergo kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or kb_2_(number) dissociations depending on the kb_ph . each kb_dissociation_(chemistry) has its own kb_dissociation_(chemistry) constant , kb_potassium and kb_potassium .the kb_first_trimester kb_dissociation_(chemistry) constant is typically greater than the kb_second_language ; i.e. , `` kb_potassium '' > `` kb_potassium '' . for example , kb_sulfuric_acid ( hso ) can donate kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_bisulfate kb_anion ( hso ) , for which `` kb_potassium '' is very kb_prespa_lake ; then kb_it can donate kb_a kb_second_language kb_proton to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_sulfate kb_anion ( kb_sulfate ) , wherein the `` kb_potassium '' is intermediate kb_strength_of_materials . the kb_prespa_lake `` kb_potassium '' for the kb_first_trimester kb_dissociation_(chemistry) makes kb_sulfuric_acid kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_acid . in kb_a similar manner , the weak unstable kb_carbonic_acid kb_acid can lose kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_bicarbonate kb_anion and lose kb_a kb_second_language to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_lithium_carbonate kb_anion ( kb_cobalt ) . both `` kb_potassium '' values are small , but `` kb_potassium '' > `` kb_potassium '' .kb_a triprotic kb_acid ( ha ) can undergo kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) , kb_2_(number) , or kb_triliteral dissociations and has kb_triliteral kb_dissociation_(chemistry) constants , where `` kb_potassium '' > `` kb_potassium '' > `` kb_potassium '' .an kb_inorganic example of kb_a triprotic kb_acid is orthophosphoric kb_acid ( hpo ) , usually just called kb_phosphoric_acid kb_acid . all kb_triliteral kb_protons can kb_beryllium successively kb_lost_film to yield hpo , then hpo , and finally kb_po_(river) , the orthophosphate kb_ion , usually just called kb_phosphate . even though the positions of the kb_triliteral kb_protons on the original kb_phosphoric_acid kb_acid kb_molecule are kb_cognate , the successive `` kb_potassium '' values differ since kb_it is energetically less favorable to lose kb_a kb_proton if the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) is more negatively kb_electric_charge . an kb_organic_chemistry example of kb_a triprotic kb_acid is citric kb_acid , which can successively lose kb_triliteral kb_protons to finally kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_citrate kb_ion .although the subsequent loss of each kb_hydrogen_ion is less favorable , all of the conjugate kb_base_(chemistry) are present in kb_solid_solution . the fractional kb_concentration , `` α '' ( kb_alpha_(letter) ) , for each kb_species can kb_beryllium calculated . for example , kb_a kb_genus diprotic kb_acid kb_will_and_testament generate 3 kb_species in kb_solid_solution : ha , ha , and a. the fractional concentrations can kb_beryllium calculated as kb_#ecclesiastical_history when given either the kb_ph ( which can kb_beryllium converted to the [ kb_hydrogen ] ) or the concentrations of the kb_acid with all its conjugate kb_base_(chemistry) :kb_a plot of these fractional concentrations against kb_ph , for given `` kb_potassium '' and `` kb_potassium '' , is known as kb_a kb_bjerrum_plot plotcategory : acid–base kb_chemistrykb_asphalt , also known as kb_asphalt ( , ) , is kb_a sticky , kb_black_sea , and highly kb_viscosity kb_liquid or semi-solid kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_petroleum . kb_it may kb_beryllium found in kb_natural_number kb_deposit_(geology) or may kb_beryllium kb_a refined kb_decay_product , and is kb_axon#classification as kb_a kb_pitch_(flight) . before the 20th century , the kb_terminology asphaltum was also used . kb_the_word_(free_love) word is kb_derived_trait from the kb_ancient_greek ἄσφαλτος `` ásphaltos '' .the kb_primary_education use ( 70 % ) of kb_asphalt is in kb_road_surface kb_construction , where kb_it is used as the glue or kb_binder_(material) mixed with kb_construction_aggregate kb_subatomic_particle to create kb_asphalt_concrete . its kb_other_(philosophy) main uses are for kb_bituminous_waterproofing kb_waterproofing products , including production of kb_roofing_felt felt and for sealing flat roofs .the terms `` kb_asphalt '' and `` kb_asphalt '' are often used interchangeably to kb_mean both kb_natural_number and manufactured kb_theory_of_forms of the kb_matter . in kb_american_english , `` kb_asphalt '' ( or `` kb_asphalt kb_cement '' ) is commonly used for kb_a refined residue from the kb_distillation process of selected crude kb_cooking_oil . outside the united kb_sovereign_state , the kb_decay_product is often called `` kb_asphalt '' , and geologists worldwide often prefer the kb_terminology for the naturally occurring kb_variety_(magazine) . common colloquial usage often refers to various kb_theory_of_forms of kb_asphalt as `` kb_tar '' , as in the kb_toponymy of the kb_la_brea_tar_pits brea kb_tar pits .naturally occurring kb_asphalt is sometimes specified by the kb_terminology `` crude kb_asphalt '' . its kb_viscosity is similar to that of cold kb_molasses while the kb_material obtained from the kb_fractional_distillation kb_distillation of kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil boiling at is sometimes referred to as `` refined kb_asphalt '' . the kb_canadians kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands of kb_alberta has most of the kb_world_war_ii 's reserves of kb_natural_number kb_asphalt in the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands , which cover , an kb_area larger than kb_kingdom_of_england .kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_asphalt '' is kb_derived_trait from the late kb_middle_english kb_australian_english , in kb_turn_(geometry) from kb_france `` asphalte '' , based on kb_late_latin kb_latin `` asphalton '' , `` asphaltum '' , which is the kb_latinisation_(literature) of the kb_ancient_greek ἄσφαλτος ( `` ásphaltos '' , `` ásphalton '' ) , kb_a word kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` asphalt/bitumen/pitch '' , which perhaps derives from ἀ- , `` without '' and σφάλλω ( `` sfallō '' ) , `` make fall '' . the kb_first_trimester use of kb_asphalt by the ancients was in the kb_nature of kb_a kb_cement for securing or joining together various kb_object_relations_theory , and kb_it thus seems likely that the kb_toponymy itself was kb_keyboard_expression of this kb_application_(computing) . specifically , kb_herodotus mentioned that kb_asphalt was brought to kb_babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall . from the kb_ancient_greek , kb_the_word_(free_love) word passed into kb_late_latin kb_latin , and thence into kb_france ( `` asphalte '' ) and kb_australian_english ( `` asphaltum '' and `` kb_asphalt '' ) . in kb_france , the kb_terminology `` asphalte '' is used for naturally occurring asphalt-soaked kb_limestone kb_deposit_(geology) , and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater kb_asphalt content than the `` asphaltic kb_concrete '' used to pave roads .the expression `` kb_asphalt '' originated in the kb_sanskrit kb_lexical_semantics `` jatu '' , kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_pitch_(flight) '' , and `` jatu-krit '' , kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_pitch_(flight) creating '' or `` kb_pitch_(flight) producing '' ( referring to kb_temperate_coniferous_forest or resinous kb_trees ) . the kb_latin kb_cognate is claimed by some to kb_beryllium originally `` gwitu-men '' ( pertaining to kb_pitch_(flight) ) , and by others , `` pixtumens '' ( exuding or bubbling kb_pitch_(flight) ) , which was subsequently kb_clipping_(morphology) to `` kb_asphalt '' , thence passing via kb_france into kb_australian_english . from the same kb_root_of_a_function is kb_derived_trait the kb_anglo-saxons word `` cwidu '' ( mastix ) , the kb_german_language word `` kitt '' ( kb_cement or kb_mastic_(plant_resin) ) and the kb_old_norse word `` kvada '' .in kb_british_english , `` kb_asphalt '' is used instead of `` kb_asphalt '' . kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_asphalt '' is instead used to refer to kb_asphalt_concrete , kb_a kb_mixture of kb_construction_aggregate and kb_asphalt itself ( also called `` kb_tarmacadam '' in common parlance ) . kb_asphalt mixed with kb_clay was usually called `` asphaltum '' , but the kb_terminology is less commonly used today .in kb_australian_english kb_australian_english , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_asphalt '' is used to describe kb_a mix of kb_construction_aggregate . `` kb_asphalt '' refers to the kb_liquid kb_derived_trait from the heavy-residues from kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil kb_distillation .in kb_american_english , `` kb_asphalt '' is kb_cognate to the kb_kingdom_of_great_britain `` kb_asphalt '' . however , `` kb_asphalt '' is also commonly used as kb_a kb_clipping_(morphology) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of `` kb_asphalt_concrete '' ( therefore kb_cognate to the kb_kingdom_of_great_britain `` kb_asphalt '' or `` kb_tarmacadam '' ) .in kb_canadian_english , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_asphalt '' is used to refer to the vast kb_canadians kb_deposit_(geology) of extremely heavy kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , while `` kb_asphalt '' is used for the kb_oil_refinery kb_decay_product . diluted kb_asphalt ( diluted with kb_naphtha to make kb_it kb_flow_(psychology) in pipelines ) is known as `` kb_dilbit '' in the kb_canadians kb_petroleum kb_industry , while kb_asphalt `` kb_upgrader '' to kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil is known as `` syncrude '' , and syncrude blended with kb_asphalt is called `` kb_synbit '' .`` kb_asphalt '' is still the preferred kb_geological kb_terminology for naturally occurring kb_deposit_(geology) of the kb_solid or semi-solid kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_petroleum . `` bituminous kb_rock_of_gibraltar '' is kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_sandstone impregnated with kb_asphalt . the kb_oil_sands of kb_alberta , kb_canada are kb_a similar kb_material .neither of the terms `` kb_asphalt '' or `` kb_asphalt '' should kb_beryllium confused with kb_tar or kb_coal_tars . kb_tar is the thick kb_liquid kb_decay_product of the dry kb_distillation and kb_pyrolysis of kb_organic_chemistry kb_hydrocarbons primarily sourced from vegetation masses , whether fossilized as with kb_coal , or freshly harvested . the majority of kb_asphalt , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , was formed naturally when vast quantities of kb_organic_chemistry kb_animal materials were deposited by kb_water and buried hundreds of metres deep at the kb_diagenesis point , where the disorganized fatty kb_hydrocarbon molecules joined together in kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) chains in the absence of kb_oxygen . kb_asphalt occurs as kb_a kb_solid or highly kb_viscosity kb_liquid . kb_it may even kb_beryllium mixed in with kb_coal kb_deposit_(geology) . kb_asphalt , and kb_coal using the kb_bergius_process process , can kb_beryllium refined into petrols such as kb_gasoline , and kb_asphalt may kb_beryllium distilled into kb_tar , not the kb_other_(philosophy) way around .the components of kb_asphalt include four main classes of kb_chemical_compound :the naphthene aromatics and kb_polar_molecule aromatics are typically the majority components . most kb_natural_number bitumens also contain organosulfur kb_chemical_compound , resulting in an overall kb_sulfur content of up to 4 % . kb_nickel and kb_vanadium are found at < 10 kb_part_per_million per million , as is typical of some kb_petroleum .the kb_matter is kb_solubility in kb_carbon_disulfide . kb_it is commonly modelled as kb_a kb_colloid , with asphaltenes as the kb_continuous_function kb_phase_(matter) . `` kb_it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of kb_asphalt , because the kb_grammatical_number of molecules with different kb_chemical_structure is extremely kb_prespa_lake '' .kb_asphalt may kb_beryllium confused with kb_coal_tar , which is kb_a visually similar kb_black_sea , kb_thermoplastic kb_material produced by the kb_destructive_distillation kb_distillation of kb_coal . during the early and mid-20th century , when kb_town_gas kb_gas was produced , kb_coal_tar was kb_a readily kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance byproduct and extensively used as the kb_binder_(material) for road kb_construction_aggregate . the kb_addition of kb_coal_tar to kb_macadam roads kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_tarmacadam '' , which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials . however , since the 1970s , when kb_natural_gas succeeded kb_town_gas kb_gas , kb_asphalt has completely overtaken the use of kb_coal_tar in these applications . kb_other_(philosophy) examples of this kb_confusion include the kb_la_brea_tar_pits brea kb_tar pits and the kb_canadians kb_oil_sands , both of which actually contain kb_natural_number kb_asphalt rather than kb_tar . `` kb_pitch_(flight) '' is another kb_terminology sometimes informally used at times to refer to kb_asphalt , as in kb_pitch_lake .for kb_economic_anthropology and kb_other_(philosophy) reasons , kb_asphalt is sometimes sold combined with kb_other_(philosophy) materials , often without kb_being labeled as anything kb_other_(philosophy) than simply `` kb_asphalt '' .of kb_particular note , in the 21st century , is the use of re-refined kb_engine kb_palm_oil bottoms -- `` reob '' or `` reobs '' —the residue of kb_automotive_oil_recycling kb_engine kb_palm_oil , collected from the bottoms of re-refining kb_vacuum_distillation towers . kb_it contains the various non-refined kb_chemical_element and kb_chemical_compound in kb_recycling kb_engine kb_palm_oil , leftover from the re-refining process—both additives to the original kb_palm_oil , and materials accumulating from its circulation in the kb_engine ( typically kb_iron and kb_copperthe majority of kb_asphalt used commercially is obtained from kb_petroleum . nonetheless , kb_prespa_lake amounts of kb_asphalt occur in concentrated kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism in kb_nature . naturally occurring kb_deposit_(geology) of kb_asphalt are formed from the remains of kb_ancient_history , kb_microscopic_scale kb_algae ( diatoms ) and kb_other_(philosophy) once-living things . these remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the kb_oceanus or kb_lake_of_fire where the organisms lived . under the kb_heat_(1972_film) ( above 50 °c ) and kb_pressure of burial deep in the kb_earth , the remains were transformed into materials such as kb_asphalt , kb_kerogen , or kb_petroleum .kb_natural_number kb_deposit_(geology) of kb_asphalt include kb_list_of_lakes_in_alberta such as the kb_pitch_lake in kb_trinidad and kb_invasion_of_tobago and kb_lake_bermudez in kb_venezuela . kb_natural_number kb_petroleum_seep occur in the kb_la_brea_tar_pits brea kb_tar pits and in the kb_dead_sea kb_sea_(astronomy) .kb_asphalt also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as `` kb_oil_sands '' in kb_alberta , kb_canada , and the similar `` kb_tar sands '' in kb_utah , kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) .the kb_canadians kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands of kb_alberta has most of the kb_world_war_ii 's reserves , in kb_triliteral huge kb_deposit_(geology) covering , an kb_area larger than kb_kingdom_of_england or kb_new_york_state . these bituminous sands contain of commercially established kb_patos-marinza_oil_field , giving kb_canada the kb_ipad_(third_generation) kb_largest_organisms kb_patos-marinza_oil_field in the kb_world_war_ii . although kb_history kb_it was used without refining to pave roads , nearly all of the output is now used as kb_raw_material kb_material for kb_oil_refinery in kb_canada and the united kb_sovereign_state .the kb_world_war_ii 's kb_largest_organisms deposit of kb_natural_number kb_asphalt , known as the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands , is located in the kb_mcmurray_formation formation of kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta . this formation is from the early kb_cretaceous , and is composed of numerous kb_lens_(optics) of oil-bearing kb_sand with up to 20 % kb_palm_oil . isotopic studies show the kb_palm_oil kb_deposit_(geology) to kb_beryllium about 110 million years kb_old_testament . kb_2_(number) smaller but still very kb_prespa_lake kb_geological_formation occur in the kb_peace_river_oil_sands sands and the kb_cold_lake_oil_sands kb_lake_of_fire kb_oil_sands , to the kb_western_culture and kb_albanian_ohrid_lake_coast of the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands , respectively . of the kb_alberta kb_deposit_(geology) , only parts of the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands are shallow enough to kb_beryllium suitable for kb_surface_mining . the kb_other_(philosophy) 80 % has to kb_beryllium produced by kb_palm_oil kb_water_well using kb_enhanced_oil_recovery kb_palm_oil recovery techniques like kb_steam-assisted_gravity_drainage kb_gravity_(2013_film) drainage .much smaller kb_heavy_crude_oil kb_palm_oil or kb_asphalt kb_deposit_(geology) also occur in the kb_uinta_basin basin in kb_utah , kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) . the kb_tar_sand_triangle kb_triangle_(musical_instrument) deposit , for example , is roughly 6 % kb_asphalt .kb_asphalt may occur in hydrothermal veins . an example of this is within the kb_uinta_basin basin of kb_utah , in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , where there is kb_a swarm of laterally and kb_vertical_direction extensive veins composed of kb_a kb_solid kb_hydrocarbon termed kb_gilsonite . these veins formed by the kb_polymerization and solidification of kb_hydrocarbons that were mobilized from the deeper kb_palm_oil shales of the kb_green_river_formation formation during burial and kb_diagenesis .kb_asphalt is similar to the kb_organic_chemistry kb_matter in carbonaceous meteorites . however , detailed studies have shown these materials to kb_beryllium distinct . the vast kb_alberta kb_asphalt resources are considered to have started out as living kb_material from kb_ocean plants and kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing , mainly kb_algae , that died millions of years ago when an kb_ancient_history kb_oceanus covered kb_alberta . they were covered by mud , buried deeply over kb_time_(magazine) , and gently cooked into kb_palm_oil by geothermal kb_heat_(1972_film) at kb_a kb_temperature of . due to kb_pressure from the rising of the kb_rocky_mountains mountains in southwestern kb_alberta , 80 to 55 million years ago , the kb_palm_oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres and trapped into underground kb_sand kb_deposit_(geology) kb_left_behind by kb_ancient_history kb_river beds and kb_oceanus beaches , thus forming the kb_oil_sands .the use of kb_natural_number kb_asphalt for kb_waterproofing , and as an kb_adhesive dates at least to the fifth kb_millennium bc , with kb_a kb_crop storage basket discovered in kb_mehrgarh , of the kb_indus_valley_civilization , lined with kb_it . by the 3rd kb_millennium bc refined kb_rock_of_gibraltar kb_asphalt was in use in the kb_region , and was used to waterproof the kb_great_bath,_mohenjo-daro kb_bath,_somerset in mohenjo-daro .in the kb_ancient_history kb_middle_east kb_east_africa , the sumerians used kb_natural_number kb_asphalt kb_deposit_(geology) for kb_mortar_(masonry) between bricks and stones , to kb_cement parts of carvings , such as eyes , into kb_place_of_articulation , for kb_spacecraft kb_caulking , and for kb_waterproofing . the kb_ancient_greek historian kb_herodotus said hot kb_asphalt was used as kb_mortar_(masonry) in the walls of kb_babylon .the kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_euphrates_tunnel beneath the kb_river kb_euphrates at kb_babylon in the kb_time_(magazine) of queen kb_semiramis ( ca . 800 bc ) was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with kb_asphalt as kb_a kb_waterproofing agent .kb_asphalt was used by kb_ancient_history kb_egyptians to kb_embalming mummies . the kb_persian_alphabet word for kb_asphalt is `` moom '' , which is related to the kb_australian_english word kb_mummy . the kb_egyptians ' kb_primary_education source of kb_asphalt was the kb_dead_sea kb_sea_(astronomy) , which kb_ancient_rome kb_roman_empire knew as `` palus asphaltites '' ( kb_asphalt kb_lake_of_fire ) .in approximately 40 kb_anno_domini , kb_dioscorides described the kb_dead_sea kb_sea_(astronomy) kb_material as `` judaicum kb_asphalt '' , and noted kb_other_(philosophy) places in the kb_region where kb_it could kb_beryllium found .the kb_sidon kb_asphalt is thought to refer to kb_material found at kb_hasbeya in kb_lebanon . kb_pliny_the_elder also refers to kb_asphalt kb_being found in kb_epirus_(ancient_state) . kb_asphalt was kb_a valuable kb_geostrategy resource . kb_it was the kb_space_debris of the kb_first_trimester known kb_battle_abbey for kb_a kb_hydrocarbon deposit — between the kb_seleucids and the kb_nabateans in 312 bc .in the kb_ancient_history kb_chinese_alchemy kb_east_africa , kb_natural_number kb_asphalt was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher kb_egyptian_fraction , leaving kb_a kb_thermoplastic kb_material of higher kb_molecular_weight that when layered on kb_object_relations_theory became quite hard upon cooling . this was used to cover kb_object_relations_theory that needed kb_waterproofing , such as scabbards and kb_other_(philosophy) items . kb_statuettes of kb_household kb_deities were also kb_casting_(metalworking) with this kb_type_(biology) of kb_material in kb_japan , and probably also in kb_china .in kb_north_america , kb_archaeology recovery has indicated that kb_asphalt was sometimes used to adhere stone kb_projectile points to wooden shafts . in kb_canada , kb_australian_aborigine kb_people_(american_magazine) used kb_asphalt seeping out of the banks of the kb_athabasca_river and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_list_of_rivers_of_alberta to waterproof birch bark canoes , and also heated kb_it in smudge pots to ward off mosquitoes in the summer .in 1553 , kb_pierre_belon belon described in kb_histidine kb_cold_working `` kb_observations_(pierre_belon) '' that `` pissasphalto '' , kb_a kb_mixture of kb_pitch_(flight) and kb_asphalt , was used in the kb_republic_of_ragusa ragusa ( now kb_dubrovnik , kb_croatia ) for tarring of ships .an 1838 edition of `` kb_mechanics magazine '' cites an early use of kb_asphalt in kb_france . kb_a pamphlet dated 1621 , by `` kb_a certain monsieur d'eyrinys , kb_sovereign_state that kb_he_(letter) had discovered the kb_existence ( of asphaltum ) in kb_prespa_lake quantities in the vicinity of neufchatel '' , and that kb_he_(letter) kb_anatolian_hypothesis to use kb_it in kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of ways – `` principally in the kb_construction of air-proof kb_granary , and in protecting , by means of the arches , the water-courses in kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth '' , which at that kb_time_(magazine) made the kb_water unusable . `` kb_he_(letter) expatiates also on the excellence of this kb_material for forming level and durable terraces '' in palaces , `` the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) likely to cross the kb_brain of kb_a parisian of that generation '' .but the kb_matter was generally neglected in kb_france until the kb_french_revolution of 1830. in the 1830s there was kb_a surge of kb_interest , and kb_asphalt became widely used `` for pavements , flat roofs , and the lining of cisterns , and in kb_kingdom_of_england , some use of kb_it had been made of kb_it for similar purposes '' . its rise in kb_europe was `` kb_a sudden phenomenon '' , after kb_natural_number kb_deposit_(geology) were found `` in kb_france at osbann ( kb_bas-rhin ) , the parc ( kb_ain ) and the puy-de-la-poix ( kb_puy-de-dôme ) '' , although kb_it could also kb_beryllium made artificially . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century uses in kb_france was the laying of about 24,000 kb_square yards of seyssel kb_asphalt at the kb_place_de_la_concorde la concorde in 1835 .among the kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet uses of kb_asphalt in the kb_united_kingdom kb_kingdom_(biology) was for etching . william kb_salmon 's `` polygraphice '' ( 1673 ) provides kb_a recipe for kb_varnish used in etching , consisting of kb_triliteral ounces of virgin kb_beeswax , kb_2_(number) ounces of kb_mastic_(plant_resin) , and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) ounce of asphaltum . by the fifth edition in 1685 , kb_he_(letter) had included more asphaltum recipes from kb_other_(philosophy) sources .the kb_first_trimester kb_kingdom_of_great_britain kb_patent for the use of kb_asphalt was `` cassell 's kb_patent asphalte or kb_asphalt '' in 1834. then on 25 november 1837 , kb_captain_r._t._claridge tappin claridge kb_patented the use of seyssel kb_asphalt ( kb_patent # 7849 ) , for use in asphalte kb_road_surface , having seen kb_it employed in kb_france and kb_belgium when visiting with kb_frederick_walter_simms walter simms , kb_world_health_organization worked with him on the introduction of kb_asphalt to kb_great_britain . dr t. kb_lamb_and_mutton phipson writes that kb_histidine kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , kb_samuel ryland phipson , kb_a friend of claridge , was also `` instrumental in introducing the asphalte kb_road_surface ( in 1836 ) '' . indeed , kb_mastic_(plant_resin) pavements had been previously employed at kb_vauxhall by kb_a competitor of claridge , but without success .claridge obtained kb_a kb_patent in kb_scottish_episcopal_church on 27 kb_march 1838 , and obtained kb_a kb_patent in kb_ireland on 23 april 1838. in 1851 , extensions for the 1837 kb_patent and for both 1838 patents were sought by the trustees of kb_a company previously formed by claridge . `` claridge 's kb_patent asphalte company '' —formed in 1838 for the purpose of introducing to kb_great_britain `` asphalte in its kb_natural_number kb_state_of_matter from the mine at pyrimont seysell in kb_france '' , — '' laid kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester kb_asphalt pavements in whitehall '' . trials were made of the kb_road_surface in 1838 on the footway in whitehall , the stable at knightsbridge barracks , `` and subsequently on the kb_space at the bottom of the steps leading from kb_waterloo_(abba_song) kb_place_of_articulation to st. james park '' . `` the formation in 1838 of claridge 's kb_patent asphalte company ( with kb_a distinguished kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of kb_aristocracy_(class) patrons , and kb_marc_isambard_brunel and kb_isambard_kingdom_brunel brunel as , respectively , kb_a trustee and consulting kb_civil_engineering ) , gave an enormous impetus to the development of kb_a kb_kingdom_of_great_britain kb_asphalt kb_industry '' . `` by the end of 1838 , at least kb_2_(number) kb_other_(philosophy) kb_list_of_companies_of_albania , robinson 's and the bastenne company , were in production '' , with kb_asphalt kb_being laid as paving at kb_brighton , herne bay , kb_diocese_of_canterbury , kensington , the strand , and kb_a kb_prespa_lake floor kb_area in bunhill-row , while meantime claridge 's whitehall paving `` continue ( d ) in good kb_order_(biology) '' .in 1838 , there was kb_a flurry of entrepreneurial activity involving kb_asphalt , which had uses beyond paving . for example , kb_asphalt could also kb_beryllium used for flooring , damp proofing in kb_buildings , and for kb_waterproofing of various types of pools and baths , both of which were also proliferating in the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century . on the kb_university_of_london stockmarket , there were various claims as to the exclusivity of kb_asphalt quality from kb_france , kb_germany and kb_kingdom_of_england . and numerous patents were granted in kb_france , with similar kb_grammatical_number of kb_patent applications kb_being denied in kb_kingdom_of_england due to their similarity to each kb_other_(philosophy) . in kb_kingdom_of_england , `` claridge 's was the kb_type_(biology) most used in the 1840s and 50s '' .in 1914 , claridge 's company entered into kb_a joint venture to produce kb_macadam#tar-bound_macadam kb_macadam , with materials manufactured through kb_a subsidiary company called clarmac roads ltd. kb_2_(number) products resulted , namely `` clarmac '' , and `` clarphalte '' , with the former kb_being manufactured by clarmac roads and the latter by claridge 's kb_patent asphalte co. , although `` clarmac '' was more widely used . however , the kb_first_world_war kb_war ruined the clarmac company , which entered into liquidation in 1915. the failure of clarmac roads ltd had kb_a flow-on effect to claridge 's company , which was itself compulsorily wound up , ceasing operations in 1917 , having invested kb_a substantial amount of funds into the kb_new_world venture , both at the outset and in kb_a subsequent attempt to save the clarmac company .kb_asphalt was thought in kb_rilindja_kombëtare century kb_great_britain to contain kb_chemical_substance with medicinal kb_chemical_property . extracts from kb_asphalt were used to treat kb_catarrh and some kb_theory_of_forms of kb_asthma and as kb_a remedy against worms , especially the kb_tapeworm .the kb_first_trimester use of kb_asphalt in the kb_new_world was by kb_indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas kb_people's_party_of_armenia . on the kb_western_culture kb_coast , as early as the 13th century , the kb_tongva_people , kb_luiseño_people and kb_chumash_people kb_people's_party_of_armenia collected the naturally occurring kb_asphalt that seeped to the kb_surface_(topology) above underlying kb_petroleum kb_deposit_(geology) . all kb_triliteral kb_group_(mathematics) used the kb_matter as an kb_adhesive . kb_it is found on many different kb_artifact_(archaeology) of tools and ceremonial items . for example , kb_it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or kb_turtle kb_electron_shells to kb_rattle_(percussion_instrument) handles . kb_it was also used in decorations . small round kb_electron_shell beads were often kb_set_(mythology) in asphaltum to provide decorations . kb_it was used as kb_a kb_sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying kb_water , possibly poisoning those kb_world_health_organization drank the kb_water . kb_asphalt was used also to kb_seal_(emblem) the planks on ocean-going canoes .kb_asphalt was kb_first_trimester used to pave streets in the 1870s . at kb_first_trimester naturally occurring `` bituminous kb_rock_of_gibraltar '' was used , such as at ritchie mines in macfarlan in ritchie county , kb_west_virginia from 1852 to 1873. in 1876 , asphalt-based paving was used to pave kb_pennsylvania avenue in kb_washington,_d.c. dc , in kb_time_(magazine) for the celebration of the national centennial . in the horse-drawn era , streets were unpaved and covered with dirt or kb_gravel . however , that produced uneven wear , opened kb_new_world hazards for pedestrians and made for dangerous potholes for bicycles and for motor vehicles . kb_manhattan alone had 130,000 horses in 1900 , pulling streetcars , wagons , and carriages , and leaving their waste behind . they were not fast , and pedestrians could dodge and scramble their way across the crowded streets . small towns continued to rely on dirt and kb_gravel , but larger cities wanted much better streets . they looked to kb_wood or granite kb_periodic_table_block by the kb_1850s_in_the_united_states . in 1890 , kb_a kb_ipad_(third_generation) of kb_chicago 's 2000 miles of streets were kb_road_surface , chiefly with wooden kb_periodic_table_block , which gave better traction than mud . kb_brick surfacing was kb_a good compromise , but even better was kb_asphalt paving , which was easy to install and to cut through to get at sewers . with kb_university_of_london and kb_paris serving as models , kb_washington,_d.c. laid 400,000 kb_square yards of kb_asphalt paving by 1882 ; kb_it became the kb_rutherford_model for buffalo , kb_philadelphia and elsewhere . by the end of the century , kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) cities boasted 30 million kb_square yards of kb_asphalt paving , kb_water_well ahead of kb_brick . the streets became faster and more dangerous kb_sulfate electric traffic lights were installed . electric trolleys ( at 12 miles per hour ) became the main kb_transportation service for middle kb_class_(biology) shoppers and kb_office workers until they bought kb_automobiles after kb_1945_(gingrich_novel) and commuted from more distant suburbs in privacy and comfort on kb_asphalt highways .kb_canada has the kb_world_war_ii 's kb_largest_organisms deposit of kb_natural_number kb_asphalt in the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands , and kb_canadians kb_first_nations along the kb_athabasca_river had kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) used kb_it to waterproof their canoes . in 1719 , kb_a kb_cree_language kb_english_alphabet#letter_names wa-pa-su brought kb_a kb_sample_(statistics) for kb_trade to kb_henry_kelsey kelsey of the kb_hudson_river 's bay company , kb_world_health_organization was the kb_first_trimester recorded kb_european_eel to kb_episcopal_see kb_it . however , kb_it was n't until 1787 that fur trader and kb_age_of_discovery kb_alexander_mackenzie_(explorer) saw the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands and said , `` at about 24 miles from the fork ( of the kb_athabasca_river and clearwater kb_list_of_rivers_of_alberta ) are some bituminous fountains into which kb_a pole of 20 kb_foot kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) may kb_beryllium inserted without the least kb_electrical_resistance . ''the kb_lightness of the deposit was obvious from the start , but the means of extracting the kb_asphalt was not . the nearest town , kb_fort_mcmurray , kb_alberta , was kb_a small fur kb_trading_post post , kb_other_(philosophy) kb_market_(economics) were far away , and kb_transportation costs were too kb_high_middle_ages to kb_spacecraft the raw bituminous kb_sand for paving . in 1915 , sidney ells of the kb_united_states_courts_of_appeals mines branch experimented with separation techniques and used the kb_decay_product to pave 600 kb_foot of road in kb_edmonton , kb_alberta . kb_other_(philosophy) roads in kb_alberta were kb_road_surface with kb_material extracted from kb_oil_sands , but kb_it was generally not kb_economic_anthropology . during the 1920s kb_karl_clark_(chemist) karl a. kb_william_clark of the kb_alberta_research_council council kb_patented kb_a hot kb_water kb_palm_oil separation process and entrepreneur robert kb_circa fitzsimmons built the kb_bitumount kb_palm_oil separation kb_plant , which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to per day of kb_asphalt using dr. kb_william_clark 's method . most of the kb_asphalt was used for kb_waterproofing roofs , but kb_semi-syllabary included fuels , lubrication kb_cooking_oil , kb_computer_printer ink , medicines , rust- and acid-proof paints , fireproof roofing , street paving , kb_patent_leather , and fence post preservatives . eventually fitzsimmons kb_ran_(film) out of kb_money and the kb_plant was taken over by the kb_alberta kb_government_of_angola . today the kb_bitumount kb_plant is kb_a kb_provincial_historic_sites_of_alberta kb_historic_site site .kb_asphalt was used in early photographic kb_technology . in 1826 or 1827 , kb_it was used by kb_france kb_scientist kb_joseph_nicéphore_niépce nicéphore niépce to make the kb_view_from_the_window_at_le_gras surviving photograph from kb_nature . the kb_asphalt was thinly coated onto kb_a kb_pewter plate which was then exposed in kb_a kb_camera . exposure to kb_light hardened the kb_asphalt and made kb_it kb_insoluble , kb_sulfate that when kb_it was subsequently rinsed with kb_a kb_solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained . many hours of exposure in the kb_camera were required , making kb_asphalt impractical for kb_ordinary_(officer) photography , but from the kb_1850s_in_the_united_states to the 1920s kb_it was in common use as kb_a kb_photoresist in the production of printing kb_photographic_plate for various photomechanical printing processes .kb_asphalt was the kb_nemesis_(nobel_play) of many artists during the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century . although widely used for kb_a kb_time_(magazine) , kb_it ultimately proved unstable for use in kb_palm_oil kb_painting , especially when mixed with the most common diluents , such as linseed kb_palm_oil , kb_varnish and kb_turpentine . unless thoroughly diluted , kb_asphalt never fully solidifies and kb_will_and_testament in kb_time_(magazine) corrupt the kb_other_(philosophy) pigments with which kb_it comes into contact . the use of kb_asphalt as kb_a glaze to kb_set_(mythology) in shadow or mixed with kb_other_(philosophy) colors to render kb_a darker kb_tone_(linguistics) resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings , for instance those of kb_eugène_delacroix . perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of kb_asphalt is kb_théodore_géricault géricault 's kb_the_raft_of_the_medusa of the kb_medusa ( 1818–1819 ) , where kb_histidine use of kb_asphalt caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the kb_paint and kb_canvas to buckle .the vast majority of refined kb_asphalt is used in kb_construction : primarily as kb_a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications . according to the kb_requirement_analysis of the end use , kb_asphalt is produced to specification . this is achieved either by refining or blending . kb_it is estimated that the kb_electric_current kb_world_war_ii use of kb_asphalt is approximately 102 million kb_tonnes per year . approximately 85 % of all the kb_asphalt produced is used as the kb_binder_(material) in kb_asphalt_concrete for roads . kb_it is also used in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_road_surface areas such as kb_airport runways , kb_car parks and footways . typically , the production of kb_asphalt_concrete involves mixing kb_fine_(penalty) and coarse kb_construction_aggregate such as kb_sand , kb_gravel and crushed kb_rock_of_gibraltar with kb_asphalt , which acts as the binding agent . kb_other_(philosophy) materials , such as kb_recycling polymers ( e.g. , kb_rubber kb_tire ) , may kb_beryllium added to the kb_asphalt to modify its kb_chemical_property according to the kb_application_(computing) for which the kb_asphalt is ultimately kb_intention .kb_a further 10 % of kb_globalization kb_asphalt production is used in roofing applications , where its kb_waterproofing qualities are invaluable .the remaining 5 % of kb_asphalt is used mainly for sealing and insulating purposes in kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of building materials , such as pipe coatings , carpet tile backing and kb_paint . kb_asphalt is kb_applied_science in the kb_construction and maintenance of many kb_structural_analysis , kb_systems_analysis , and components , such as the following :the kb_largest_organisms use of kb_asphalt is for making kb_asphalt_concrete for road surfaces ; this accounts for approximately 85 % of the kb_asphalt consumed in the united kb_sovereign_state . there are about 4,000 kb_asphalt_concrete mixing plants in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , and kb_a similar kb_grammatical_number in kb_europe .kb_asphalt_concrete kb_road_surface mixes are typically composed of 5 % kb_asphalt kb_cement and 95 % kb_construction_aggregate ( stone , kb_sand , and kb_gravel ) . due to its highly kb_viscosity kb_nature , kb_asphalt kb_cement must kb_beryllium heated kb_sulfate kb_it can kb_beryllium mixed with the kb_construction_aggregate at the kb_asphalt mixing facility . the kb_temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the kb_asphalt and the kb_construction_aggregate , but kb_asphalt_concrete#mixture_formulations kb_asphalt technologies allow producers to reduce the kb_temperature required .the weight of an kb_asphalt kb_road_surface depends upon the kb_construction_aggregate kb_type_(biology) , the kb_asphalt , and the kb_air_(classical_element) void content . an average example in the united kb_sovereign_state is about 112 pounds per kb_square_yard , per kb_inch of kb_road_surface thickness .when maintenance is performed on kb_asphalt pavements , such as kb_pavement_milling to remove kb_a worn or damaged kb_surface_(topology) , the removed kb_material can kb_beryllium returned to kb_a facility for kb_fish_processing into kb_new_world kb_road_surface mixtures . the kb_asphalt in the removed kb_material can kb_beryllium reactivated and put back to use in kb_new_world kb_road_surface mixes . with some 95 % of kb_road_surface roads kb_being constructed of or surfaced with kb_asphalt , kb_a substantial amount of kb_asphalt kb_road_surface kb_material is reclaimed each year . according to kb_industry surveys conducted annually by the kb_federal_highway_administration kb_administration_(government) and the national kb_asphalt kb_road_surface kb_continental_association , more than 99 % of the kb_asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of kb_new_world pavements , roadbeds , shoulders and embankments .kb_asphalt_concrete paving is widely used in airports around the kb_world_war_ii . due to the sturdiness and ability to kb_beryllium repaired quickly , kb_it is widely used for runways .kb_mastic_asphalt is kb_a kb_type_(biology) of kb_asphalt that differs from dense graded kb_asphalt ( kb_asphalt_concrete ) in that kb_it has kb_a higher kb_asphalt ( kb_binder_(material) ) content , usually around 7–10 % of the whole kb_construction_aggregate mix , as opposed to rolled kb_asphalt_concrete , which has only around 5 % kb_asphalt . this kb_thermoplastic kb_matter is widely used in the building kb_industry for kb_waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground . kb_mastic_asphalt is heated to kb_a kb_temperature of and is kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) in layers to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism an impervious kb_potential_barrier about thick .kb_a kb_grammatical_number of technologies allow kb_asphalt to kb_beryllium mixed at much lower temperatures . these involve mixing with kb_petroleum solvents to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` cutbacks '' with kb_redox kb_melting_point or mixing with kb_water to kb_turn_(geometry) the kb_asphalt into an kb_emulsion . kb_asphalt emulsions contain up to 70 % kb_asphalt and typically less than 1.5 % kb_protein_sequencing additives . there are kb_2_(number) main types of emulsions with different affinity for kb_construction_aggregate , kb_cationic and kb_anionic . kb_asphalt emulsions are used in kb_a wide kb_variety_(magazine) of applications . kb_chipseal involves spraying the road kb_surface_(topology) with kb_asphalt kb_emulsion followed by kb_a layer of crushed kb_rock_of_gibraltar , kb_gravel or crushed kb_slag . kb_slurry kb_seal_(emblem) involves the creation of kb_a kb_mixture of kb_asphalt kb_emulsion and kb_fine_(penalty) crushed kb_construction_aggregate that is kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) on the kb_surface_(topology) of kb_a road . cold-mixed kb_asphalt can also kb_beryllium made from kb_asphalt kb_emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed kb_asphalt , several inches in depth , and kb_asphalt emulsions are also blended into kb_recycling hot-mix kb_asphalt to create low-cost pavements .kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , also known as syncrude , is the output from kb_a kb_upgrader facility used in connection with kb_palm_oil kb_sand production in kb_canada . bituminous sands are mined using enormous ( 100 ton capacity ) kb_power_(physics) shovels and loaded into even larger ( 400 ton capacity ) kb_dump_trucks trucks for kb_movement_(sign_language) to an upgrading facility . the process used to extract the kb_asphalt from the kb_sand is kb_a hot kb_water process originally kb_adaptation by kb_karl_clark_(chemist) karl kb_william_clark of the kb_university_of_alberta kb_alberta during the 1920s . after extraction from the kb_sand , the kb_asphalt is fed into kb_a kb_upgrader which converts kb_it into kb_a kb_light_crude_oil kb_palm_oil kb_cognate . this synthetic kb_matter is kb_fluid enough to kb_beryllium transferred through kb_petroleum kb_palm_oil pipelines and can kb_beryllium fed into kb_petroleum kb_oil_refinery without any further treatment . by 2015 kb_canadians kb_asphalt upgraders were producing over per day of kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , of which 75 % was exported to kb_oil_refinery in the united kb_sovereign_state .in kb_alberta , five kb_asphalt upgraders produce kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil and kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of kb_other_(philosophy) products : the kb_suncor_energy kb_energy_industry upgrader near kb_fort_mcmurray , kb_alberta produces kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil plus kb_diesel_engine kb_fuel ; the kb_syncrude_canada kb_canada , kb_canadian_natural_resources resources , and kb_nexen upgraders near kb_fort_mcmurray produce kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil ; and the kb_electron_shell kb_scotford_upgrader upgrader near kb_edmonton produces kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil plus an intermediate kb_feedstock for the nearby kb_electron_shell kb_oil_refinery . kb_a sixth upgrader , under kb_construction in 2015 near redwater , kb_alberta , kb_will_and_testament upgrade half of its crude kb_asphalt directly to kb_diesel_engine kb_fuel , with the remainder of the output kb_being sold as kb_feedstock to nearby kb_oil_refinery and kb_petrochemical plants .kb_canadians kb_asphalt does not differ substantially from kb_cooking_oil such as kb_venezuelans extra-heavy and kb_mexican_people kb_heavy_crude_oil kb_palm_oil in kb_protein_sequencing kb_function_composition , and the real difficulty is moving the extremely kb_viscosity kb_asphalt through kb_palm_oil pipelines to the refinery . many kb_modern_history kb_oil_refinery are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded kb_asphalt directly into products such as kb_gasoline , kb_diesel_engine kb_fuel , and refined kb_asphalt without any preprocessing . this is particularly common in areas such as the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) kb_gulf_of_mexico kb_coast , where kb_refineries were kb_aircraft_design_process to process kb_venezuelans and kb_mexican_people kb_palm_oil , and in areas such as the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) kb_midwestern_united_states where kb_refineries were rebuilt to process kb_heavy_crude_oil kb_palm_oil as domestic kb_light kb_extraction_of_petroleum declined . given the kb_utility , such kb_heavy_crude_oil kb_oil_refinery usually prefer to buy kb_asphalt rather than synthetic kb_palm_oil because the cost is lower , and in some kb_noun_case because they prefer to produce more kb_diesel_engine kb_fuel and less kb_gasoline . by 2015 kb_canadians production and exports of non-upgraded kb_asphalt exceeded that of kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil at over per day , of which about 65 % was exported to the united kb_sovereign_state .because of the difficulty of moving crude kb_asphalt through pipelines , non-upgraded kb_asphalt is usually diluted with kb_natural-gas_condensate condensate in kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism called kb_dilbit or with kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , called kb_synbit . however , to meet international competition , much non-upgraded kb_asphalt is now sold as kb_a blend of kb_cross-platform_software kb_grade_(education) of kb_asphalt , kb_petroleum kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , and condensate in kb_a standardized benchmark kb_decay_product such as kb_western_canadian_select select . this sour , heavy kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil blend is kb_aircraft_design_process to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy kb_cooking_oil such as kb_petroleum_industry_in_mexico or kb_arabian_plate kb_dubai_crude crude .kb_asphalt was used starting in the kb_1960s_in_the_united_states as kb_a kb_hydrophobe kb_matrix_(math) aiming to encapsulate kb_radioactive_decay waste such as medium-activity kb_salt_(chemistry) ( mainly kb_solubility kb_sodium_nitrate and kb_sodium_sulfate ) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or kb_radioactive_decay sludges from kb_sediment_transport#fluvial ponds . bituminised kb_radioactive_decay waste containing highly kb_radiotoxic kb_ionizing_radiation#alpha_particles kb_transuranium_element from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in kb_france , kb_belgium and kb_japan , but this kb_type_(biology) of waste kb_physical_exercise has been abandoned because operational kb_air_safety issues ( risks of kb_fire_(classical_element) , as occurred in kb_a bituminisation kb_plant at tokai works in kb_japan ) and long-term stability kb_problems_(aristotle) related to their kb_deep_geological_repository in deep kb_rock_of_gibraltar kb_geological_formation . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the main problem is the swelling of kb_asphalt exposed to kb_radiation and to kb_water . kb_asphalt swelling is kb_first_trimester induced by kb_radiation because of the presence of kb_hydrogen kb_gas bubbles generated by kb_alpha_(letter) and gamma kb_radiolysis . kb_a kb_second_language kb_mechanism_(biology) is kb_the_matrix kb_matrix_(math) swelling when the encapsulated kb_hygroscopic kb_salt_(chemistry) exposed to kb_water or moisture start to rehydrate and to kb_dissolve_(filmmaking) . the kb_high_middle_ages kb_concentration of kb_salt_(chemistry) in the pore kb_solid_solution inside the bituminised kb_matrix_(math) is then responsible for kb_osmosis effects inside the bituminised kb_matrix_(math) . the kb_water moves in the direction of the concentrated kb_salt_(chemistry) , the kb_asphalt acting as kb_a kb_semipermeable_membrane kb_cell_membrane . this also kb_causes_of_autism kb_the_matrix kb_matrix_(math) to swell . the swelling kb_pressure due to kb_osmosis effect under constant kb_volume can kb_beryllium as kb_high_middle_ages as 200 bar . if not properly managed , this kb_high_middle_ages kb_pressure can cause fractures in the near field of kb_a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste . when the bituminised kb_matrix_(math) has been altered by swelling , encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of kb_ground_water kb_water and released in the geosphere . the kb_high_middle_ages kb_ionic_strength of the concentrated kb_saline_(medicine) kb_solid_solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in kb_clay host kb_rock_(geology) . the presence of chemically kb_reactivity_(chemistry) kb_nitrate can also kb_affect_(psychology) the kb_redox conditions prevailing in the host kb_rock_of_gibraltar by establishing kb_redox conditions , preventing the kb_redox of redox-sensitive radionuclides . under their higher valences , radionuclides of kb_chemical_element such as kb_selenium , technetium , kb_uranium , kb_neptunium and kb_plutonium have kb_a higher kb_solubility and are also often present in kb_water as non-retarded anions . this makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging .different kb_type_(biology) of kb_asphalt have been used : blown kb_asphalt ( partly kb_oxidation with kb_air_(classical_element) kb_oxygen at kb_high_middle_ages kb_temperature after kb_distillation , and harder ) and direct kb_distillation kb_asphalt ( softer ) . blown bitumens like mexphalte , with kb_a kb_high_middle_ages content of kb_saturation_(chemistry) kb_hydrocarbons , are more easily biodegraded by microorganisms than direct kb_distillation kb_asphalt , with kb_a low content of kb_saturation_(chemistry) kb_hydrocarbons and kb_a kb_high_middle_ages content of kb_aromatic kb_hydrocarbons .kb_concrete encapsulation of radwaste is presently considered kb_a safer alternative by the kb_nuclear_industry kb_industry and the kb_waste_management kb_management organisations .roofing shingles account for most of the remaining kb_asphalt consumption . kb_semi-syllabary include kb_cattle sprays , fence-post treatments , and kb_waterproofing for fabrics . kb_asphalt is used to make kb_japan_black , kb_a kb_lacquerabout 40,000,000 tons were produced in 1984. kb_it is obtained as the `` heavy '' ( i.e. , difficult to distill ) kb_fraction_(mathematics) . kb_material with kb_a kb_boiling_point point greater than around 500 °c is considered kb_asphalt . kb_vacuum_distillation separates kb_it from the kb_other_(philosophy) components in kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil ( such as kb_naphtha , kb_gasoline and kb_diesel_engine ) . the resulting kb_material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the kb_chemical_property of the kb_material to suit applications . in kb_a kb_de-asphalting_unit kb_units_of_measurement , the crude kb_asphalt is treated with either kb_propane or kb_butane in kb_a kb_supercritical_fluid kb_phase_(matter) to extract the lighter molecules , which are then separated . further kb_fish_processing is possible by `` blowing '' the kb_decay_product : namely reacting kb_it with kb_oxygen . this step makes the kb_decay_product harder and more kb_viscosity .kb_asphalt is typically stored and transported at temperatures around . sometimes kb_diesel_oil or kb_kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity ; upon kb_childbirth , these lighter materials are separated out of the kb_mixture . this kb_mixture is often called `` kb_asphalt kb_feedstock '' , or bfs . some kb_dump_trucks trucks route the hot kb_engine exhaust through pipes in the dump kb_human_body to keep the kb_material warm . the backs of tippers carrying kb_asphalt , as kb_water_well as some kb_car_handling equipment , are also commonly sprayed with kb_a releasing agent before filling to kb_aid release . kb_diesel_oil is no longer used as kb_a kb_release_agent agent due to environmental concerns .naturally occurring crude kb_asphalt impregnated in kb_sedimentary_rock is the kb_prime_(symbol) kb_animal_feed stock for kb_petroleum production from `` kb_oil_sands '' , currently under development in kb_alberta , kb_canada . kb_canada has most of the kb_world_war_ii 's supply of kb_natural_number kb_asphalt , covering 140,000 kb_square kilometres ( an kb_area larger than kb_kingdom_of_england ) , giving kb_it the second-largest proven kb_patos-marinza_oil_field in the kb_world_war_ii . the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands are the kb_largest_organisms kb_asphalt deposit in kb_canada and the only kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) accessible to kb_surface_mining , although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper kb_deposit_(geology) becoming producible by `` kb_in_situ situ '' methods . because of kb_world_oil_market_chronology_from_2003 increases after 2003 , producing kb_asphalt became highly profitable , but as kb_a result of the decline after 2014 kb_it became uneconomic to build kb_new_world plants again . by 2014 , kb_canadians crude kb_asphalt production averaged about per day and was projected to rise to per day by 2020. the total amount of crude kb_asphalt in kb_alberta that could kb_beryllium extracted is estimated to kb_beryllium about , which at kb_a rate of would last about 200 years .although uncompetitive economically , kb_asphalt can kb_beryllium made from nonpetroleum-based renewable resources such as kb_sugar , kb_molasses and kb_rice , kb_corn and kb_potato starches . kb_asphalt can also kb_beryllium made from waste kb_material by kb_fractional_distillation kb_distillation of used kb_motor_oil kb_palm_oil , which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills . use of kb_motor_oil kb_palm_oil may cause premature kb_cracking_(chemistry) in colder climates , resulting in roads that need to kb_beryllium repaved more

occurring kb_solid kb_hydrocarbon kb_asphalt found in native kb_deposit_(geology) in kb_selenice , in kb_albania , the only kb_european_eel kb_asphalt mine still in use . the kb_asphalt is found in the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of veins , filling cracks in kb_a more or less horizontal direction . the kb_asphalt content varies from kb_bismuth % to 92 % ( kb_solubility in kb_carbon disulphide ) , with kb_a penetration kb_lightness near to kb_0_(number) and kb_a softening point ( kb_ring_(mathematics) and ball ) around 120 °c . the kb_insoluble kb_matter , consisting mainly of kb_silica kb_ore , ranges from kb_group_8_element % to 17 % .kb_albanians kb_asphalt extraction has kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_history and was practiced in an organized way by kb_ancient_rome kb_roman_empire . after kb_century_(cricket) of silence , the kb_first_trimester mentions of kb_albanians kb_asphalt appeared only in 1868 , when the frenchman kb_henri_coquand published the kb_first_trimester kb_geological description of the kb_deposit_(geology) of kb_albanians kb_asphalt . in 1875 , the kb_exploitation_film kb_catalan_constitutions were granted to the kb_ottoman_empire kb_government_of_angola and in 1912 , they were transferred to the kb_italian_language company simsa . since kb_1945_(gingrich_novel) , the mine was exploited by the kb_albanians kb_government_of_angola and from 2001 to date , the kb_management passed to kb_a kb_france company , which organized the kb_mining_industry process for the manufacture of the kb_natural_number kb_asphalt on an industrial scale .today the mine is predominantly exploited in an kb_open_standard pit quarry but several of the many underground mines ( deep and extending over several km ) still remain viable . selenizza is produced primarily in granular kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , after kb_melting_point the kb_asphalt pieces selected in the mine .selenizza is mainly used as an additive in the kb_road_surface kb_construction sector . kb_it is mixed with traditional kb_asphalt to improve both the viscoelastic kb_chemical_property and the kb_electrical_resistance to ageing . kb_it may kb_beryllium blended with the hot kb_asphalt in kb_german_tanks_in_world_war_ii , but its granular kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism allows kb_it to kb_beryllium fed in the mixer or in the kb_recycling kb_ring_(mathematics) of normal kb_asphalt plants . kb_other_(philosophy) typical applications include the production of kb_mastic_(plant_resin) asphalts for sidewalks , kb_romanesque_architecture , car-parks and kb_urban_area roads as kb_water_well as drilling kb_fluid additives for the kb_crude_oil kb_gas kb_industry . selenizza is kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance in

kb_science of the kb_natural_number selenizza compared with kb_petroleum kb_asphalt has shown that the environmental impact of the selenizza is about half the impact of the road kb_asphalt produced in kb_oil_refinery in terms of kb_carbon_dioxide kb_emission_spectra .although kb_asphalt typically makes up only 4 to 5 percent ( by weight ) of the kb_road_surface kb_mixture , as the kb_road_surface 's kb_binder_(material) , kb_it is also the most expensive part of the cost of the road-paving kb_material .during kb_asphalt 's early use in kb_modern_history paving , kb_palm_oil refiners gave kb_it away . however , kb_asphalt is , today , kb_a highly traded commodity . its prices increased substantially in the early 21st century . kb_a kb_federal_government_of_the_united_states report kb_sovereign_state :the report indicates that an `` average '' 1-mile ( 1.6-kilometer ) -long , four-lane highway would include `` 300 tons of kb_asphalt , '' which , `` in kb_2002_australian_open

kb_teleprinter kb_code promoted by kb_bell kb_big_data kb_service_(economics) . kb_cold_working on the kb_ascii standard began on kb_october 6 , kb_u.s._presidential_election,_1960 , with the kb_first_trimester meeting of the kb_american_standards_association kb_continental_association 's ( asa ) ( now the kb_american_national_standards_institute kb_corporate_social_responsibility institute or kb_american_national_standards_institute ) x3.2 subcommittee . the kb_first_trimester edition of the standard was published in 1963 , underwent kb_a kb_major_(united_states) revision during 1967 , and experienced its most recent update during 1986. compared to kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet kb_telegraph kb_code_(cryptography) , the kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_bell kb_code and kb_ascii were both kb_totally_ordered_set for more convenient kb_sorting_algorithm ( i.e. , alphabetization ) of lists , and added features for devices kb_other_(philosophy) than teleprinters .originally based on the kb_english_alphabet , kb_ascii encodes 128 specified kb_character_(computing) into seven-bit integers as shown by the kb_ascii chart above . ninety-five of the encoded kb_character_(computing) are printable : these include the digits `` 0 '' to `` 9 '' , kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_a '' to `` kb_carboxybenzyl '' , kb_upper_case kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_a '' to `` kb_carboxybenzyl '' , and punctuation kb_symbols . in kb_addition , the original kb_ascii specification included 33 non-printing control kb_code_(cryptography) which originated with

subcommittee 's x3.2.4 kb_working_group kb_group_(periodic_table) ( now kb_incits ) . the asa became the kb_united_states_of_america_standards_institute of kb_americas kb_corporate_social_responsibility institute ( usasi ) and ultimately the kb_american_national_standards_institute kb_corporate_social_responsibility institute ( kb_american_national_standards_institute ) .with the kb_other_(philosophy) special kb_character_(computing) and control kb_code_(cryptography) filled in , kb_ascii was published as asa x3.4-1963 , leaving 28 kb_code positions without any assigned kb_meaning_(linguistics) , reserved for future standardization , and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) unassigned kb_control_code kb_code . there was some kb_abortion_debate at the kb_time_(magazine) whether there should kb_beryllium more control kb_character_(computing) rather than the kb_lower_case kb_alphabet . the indecision did not last kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) : during may 1963 the ccitt working party on the kb_new_world kb_telegraph kb_alphabet kb_anatolian_hypothesis to assign kb_lower_case kb_character_(computing) to `` sticks '' 6 and 7 , and kb_international_organization_for_standardization organization for standardization tc 97 sc kb_alkaline_earth_metal voted during kb_october to incorporate the change into

and 7 caused the kb_character_(computing) to differ in kb_bit_(horse) kb_pattern from the kb_upper_egypt case by kb_a kb_single_bond kb_bit_(horse) , which simplified kb_case-insensitive kb_character_(computing) matching and the kb_construction of keyboards and kb_computer_printer .the x3 committee made kb_other_(philosophy) changes , including kb_other_(philosophy) kb_new_world kb_character_(computing) ( the kb_brace_(punctuation) and kb_vertical_bar bar kb_character_(computing) ) , renaming some control kb_character_(computing) ( som became start of header ( soh ) ) and

kb_american_national_standards_institute x3.4-1986 .revisions of the kb_ascii standard :in the x3.15 standard , the x3 committee also addressed how kb_ascii should kb_beryllium transmitted (

kb_teleprinter encoding kb_systems_analysis . like kb_other_(philosophy) kb_character_(computing) encodings , kb_ascii specifies kb_a correspondence between kb_digital_data kb_bit_(horse) patterns and kb_character_(computing) kb_symbols ( i.e . kb_graphemes and control kb_character_(computing) ) . this allows kb_digital_data devices to communicate with each kb_other_(philosophy) and to process , store , and communicate character-oriented kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) such as written kb_language . before kb_ascii was kb_adaptation , the encodings in use included 26 kb_english_alphabet kb_character_(computing) , 10 numerical digits , and from 11 to 25 special graphic kb_symbols . to include all these , and control kb_character_(computing) compatible with the kb_ccitt consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique ( ccitt ) international kb_telegraph kb_alphabet no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal ( kb_ita2 ) standard of 1924 , kb_fieldata ( 1956 ) , and early kb_ebcdic ( 1963 ) , more than 64 kb_code_(cryptography) were required for kb_ascii .kb_ita2 were in kb_turn_(geometry) based on the 5-bit kb_telegraph_code kb_émile_baudot baudot invented in 1870 and kb_patented in 1874 .the committee debated the possibility of kb_a kb_shift_code kb_function_(biology) ( like in kb_ita2 ) , which would allow more than 64 kb_code_(cryptography) to kb_beryllium represented by kb_a kb_six-bit_character_code kb_code . in kb_a shifted kb_code , some kb_character_(computing) kb_code_(cryptography) determine choices between options for the following kb_character_(computing) kb_code_(cryptography) . kb_it allows compact encoding , but is less reliable for kb_data_transmission , as an kb_error in transmitting the kb_shift_code kb_code typically makes kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) part of the kb_transmission_coefficient unreadable . the kb_corporate_social_responsibility committee decided against shifting , and kb_sulfate kb_ascii required at least kb_a seven-bit kb_code .the committee considered an kb_eight-bit kb_code , since eight bits ( octets ) would allow kb_2_(number) four-bit patterns to efficiently encode kb_2_(number) digits with kb_binary-coded_decimal kb_decimal . however , kb_it would require all kb_data_transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice . the committee voted to use kb_a seven-bit kb_code to minimize costs associated with kb_data_transmission . since perforated tape at the kb_time_(magazine) could record eight bits in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_positional_notation , kb_it also allowed for kb_a kb_parity_bit kb_bit_(horse) for kb_error_checking if desired . kb_eight-bit machines ( with octets as the native kb_big_data kb_type_(biology) ) that did not use parity checking typically kb_set_(mythology) the eighth kb_bit_(horse) to 0. in some kb_computer_printer , the kb_high_middle_ages kb_bit_(horse) was used to enable kb_italics printing .the kb_code itself was patterned kb_sulfate that most control kb_code_(cryptography) were together and all graphic kb_code_(cryptography) were together , for ease of identification . the kb_first_trimester kb_2_(number) kb_sulfate called `` kb_ascii sticks '' ( 32 positions ) were reserved for control kb_character_(computing) . the `` kb_space '' kb_character_(computing) had to come before graphics to make kb_sorting_algorithm easier , kb_sulfate kb_it became kb_positional_notation 20 ; for the same kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits . the committee decided kb_it was important to support kb_upper_case kb_sixbit_code_pages alphabets , and chose to kb_pattern kb_ascii kb_sulfate kb_it could kb_beryllium kb_redox easily to kb_a usable 64-character kb_set_(mythology) of graphic kb_code_(cryptography) , as was done in the kb_dec_sixbit kb_code ( 1963 ) . kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) were therefore not interleaved with kb_upper_case . to keep options kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance for kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) and kb_other_(philosophy) graphics , the special and numeric kb_code_(cryptography) were arranged before the kb_letter_(alphabet) , and the kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_a '' was placed in kb_positional_notation 41 to match the draft of the corresponding kb_kingdom_of_great_britain standard . the digits 0–9 are prefixed with 011 , but the remaining kb_nibble bits correspond to their respective values in kb_binary_number , making kb_conversion_to_christianity with kb_binary-coded_decimal kb_decimal straightforward .many of the non-alphanumeric kb_character_(computing) were positioned to correspond to their shifted kb_positional_notation on typewriters ; an important subtlety is that these were based on `` kb_mechanics '' typewriters , not `` electric '' typewriters . kb_mechanics typewriters followed the standard kb_set_(mythology) by the remington no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal ( 1878 ) , the kb_first_trimester kb_typewriter with kb_a kb_shift_code kb_key_(cryptography) , and the shifted values of codice_1 were codice_2 early typewriters omitted `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' , using `` kb_oxygen '' ( kb_capital_letter `` kb_oxygen '' ) and `` l '' ( kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) `` l '' ) instead , but codice_3 and codice_4 pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common . thus , in kb_ascii codice_5 were placed in the kb_second stick , positions 1–5 , corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent stick . the parentheses could not correspond to `` 9 '' and `` 0 '' , however , because the kb_place_of_articulation corresponding to `` 0 '' was taken by the kb_space kb_character_(computing) . this was accommodated by removing codice_6 ( kb_underscore ) from `` 6 '' and shifting the remaining kb_character_(computing) , which corresponded to many kb_european_eel typewriters that placed the parentheses with `` kb_group_8_element '' and `` 9 '' . this discrepancy from typewriters kb_light-emitting_diode to bit-paired keyboards , notably the kb_teletype_model_33 kb_rutherford_model 33 , which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to kb_ascii , not to traditional kb_mechanics typewriters . electric typewriters , notably the kb_ibm_selectric ( 1961 ) , used kb_a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers following the kb_ibm_pc ( 1981 ) , especially kb_model_m ( kb_1984_world_rally_championship_season ) and thus kb_shift_code values for kb_symbols on kb_modern_history keyboards do not correspond as closely to the kb_ascii table as kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet keyboards did . the codice_7 pair also dates to the no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal , and the codice_8 pairs were used on some keyboards ( others , including the no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal , did not kb_shift_code codice_9 ( comma ) or codice_10 ( kb_full_stop stop ) kb_sulfate they could kb_beryllium used in kb_upper_case without unshifting ) . however , kb_ascii split the codice_11 pair ( dating to no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal ) , and rearranged mathematical kb_symbols ( varied conventions , commonly codice_12 ) to codice_13 .some common kb_character_(computing) were not included , notably codice_14 , while codice_15 were included as kb_diacritics for international use , and codice_16 for mathematical use , together with the kb_simple_polygon kb_line_(geometry) kb_character_(computing) codice_17 ( in kb_addition to common codice_18 ) . the `` @ '' kb_symbol was not used in kb_continental_europe and the committee expected kb_it would kb_beryllium replaced by an accented `` à '' in the kb_france variation , kb_sulfate the `` @ '' was placed in kb_positional_notation 40 , kb_right-wing_politics before the kb_letter_(alphabet) kb_a .the control kb_code_(cryptography) felt kb_essential_element for kb_data_transmission were the start of message ( som ) , end of address ( eoa ) , kb_end_of_message of message ( eom ) , end of kb_transmission_coefficient ( eot ) , `` kb_world_health_organization are you ? '' ( wru ) , `` are you ? '' ( ru ) , kb_a reserved kb_analyzer control ( dc0 ) , synchronous idle ( sync ) , and acknowledge ( ack ) . these were positioned to maximize the kb_hamming_distance kb_distance between their kb_bit_(horse) patterns .ascii-code kb_order_(biology) is also called `` asciibetical '' kb_order_(biology) . kb_collation of kb_big_data is sometimes done in this kb_order_(biology) rather than `` standard '' kb_alphabetical_order kb_order_(biology) ( kb_collating_sequence sequence ) . the main deviations in kb_ascii kb_order_(biology) are :an intermediate kb_order_(biology) converts kb_upper_case kb_letter_(alphabet) to kb_lower_case before comparing kb_ascii values .kb_ascii reserves the kb_first_trimester 32 kb_code_(cryptography) ( kb_grammatical_number 0–31 kb_decimal ) for control kb_character_(computing) : kb_code_(cryptography) originally kb_intention not to represent printable kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) , but rather to control devices ( such as kb_computer_printer ) that make use of kb_ascii , or to provide kb_metadata about kb_big_data streams such as those stored on kb_magnetic tape .for example , kb_character_(computing) 10 represents the `` kb_line_feed '' kb_function_(biology) ( which kb_causes_of_autism kb_a printer to advance its paper ) , and kb_character_(computing) kb_group_8_element represents `` backspace '' . refers to control kb_character_(computing) that do not include kb_carriage_return return , kb_line_feed or kb_whitespace_(computer_science) as non-whitespace control kb_character_(computing) . except for the control kb_character_(computing) that kb_linguistic_prescription kb_elementary_school line-oriented formatting , kb_ascii does not define any kb_mechanism_(biology) for describing the kb_structure or kb_appearance_(philosophy) of text within kb_a document . kb_other_(philosophy) schemes , such as markup languages , address page and document layout and formatting .the original kb_ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) . the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional , for example where kb_a kb_character_(computing) would kb_beryllium used slightly differently on kb_a kb_computer_terminal link than on kb_a kb_data_stream , and sometimes accidental , for example with the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of `` kb_delete_key '' .probably the most influential kb_single_bond kb_analyzer on the kb_interpretation_(logic) of these kb_character_(computing) was the kb_teletype_model_33 kb_rutherford_model 33 asr , which was kb_a printing kb_computer_terminal with an kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance kb_punched_tape tape reader/punch option . kb_punched_tape tape was kb_a very popular kb_list_of_art_mediums for long-term kb_program_(computing) storage until the 1980s , less costly and in some ways less fragile than kb_magnetic tape . in kb_particular , the kb_teletype_model_33 kb_rutherford_model 33 kb_machine assignments for kb_code_(cryptography) 17 ( control-q , dc1 , also known as xon ) , 19 ( control-s , dc3 , also known as xoff ) , and 127 ( kb_delete_key ) became kb_de_facto kb_corporate_social_responsibility . the kb_rutherford_model 33 was also notable for taking the description of control-g ( kb_code 7 , bel , kb_meaning_(linguistics) audibly alert the operator ) literally , as the kb_units_of_measurement contained an actual kb_bell which kb_it rang when kb_it received kb_a bel kb_character_(computing) . because the keytop for the kb_oxygen kb_key_(cryptography) also showed kb_a left-arrow kb_symbol ( from ascii-1963 , which had this kb_character_(computing) instead of kb_underscore ) , kb_a noncompliant use of kb_code 15 ( control-o , kb_shift_code in ) interpreted as `` kb_delete_key previous kb_character_(computing) '' was also kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by many early timesharing kb_systems_analysis but eventually became neglected .when kb_a teletype 33 asr equipped with the automatic kb_punched_tape tape kb_reader_(academic_rank) received kb_a control-s ( xoff , an abbreviation for transmit off ) , kb_it caused the tape kb_reader_(academic_rank) to stop ; receiving control-q ( xon , `` transmit on '' ) caused the tape kb_reader_(academic_rank) to resume . this technique became kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by several early kb_apollo_guidance_computer operating kb_systems_analysis as kb_a `` handshaking '' signal warning kb_a sender to stop kb_transmission_coefficient because of impending kb_arithmetic_overflow ; kb_it persists to this day in many kb_systems_analysis as kb_a kb_manual_(music) output control technique . on some kb_systems_analysis control-s retains its kb_meaning_(linguistics) but control-q is replaced by kb_a kb_second control-s to resume output . the 33 asr also could kb_beryllium configured to employ control-r ( dc2 ) and control-t ( dc4 ) to start and stop the tape kb_punch_(magazine) ; on some units equipped with this kb_function_(biology) , the corresponding kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) lettering on the keycap above the kb_letter_(alphabet) was tape and tape respectively .the teletype could not move the kb_human_head backwards , kb_sulfate kb_it did not put kb_a kb_key_(cryptography) on the keyboard to send kb_a bs ( backspace ) . instead there was kb_a kb_key_(cryptography) marked `` rubout '' that sent kb_code 127 ( del ) . the purpose of this kb_key_(cryptography) was to erase mistakes in kb_a hand-typed kb_punched_tape tape : the operator had to push kb_a kb_button_(control) on the tape kb_punch_(magazine) to back kb_it up , then kb_type_(biology) the rubout , which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with kb_a kb_character_(computing) that was kb_intention to kb_beryllium ignored . teletypes were commonly used for the less-expensive computers from kb_digital_equipment_corporation corporation , kb_sulfate these kb_systems_analysis had to use the kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance kb_key_(cryptography) and thus the del kb_code to erase the previous kb_character_(computing) . because of this , kb_declination kb_video terminals ( by default ) sent the del kb_code for the kb_key_(cryptography) marked `` backspace '' while the kb_key_(cryptography) marked `` kb_delete_key '' sent an kb_escape_character sequence , while many kb_other_(philosophy) terminals sent bs for the backspace kb_key_(cryptography) . the kb_unix kb_computer_terminal driver could only use kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_code to back up , this could kb_beryllium kb_set_(mythology) to bs `` or '' del , but not both , resulting in kb_a very kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) period of annoyance where you had to correct kb_it depending on what kb_computer_terminal you were using ( kb_modern_history kb_electron_shells using kb_readline kb_natural_language_understanding both kb_code_(cryptography) ) . the assumption that no kb_key_(cryptography) sent kb_a bs caused control+h to kb_beryllium used for kb_other_(philosophy) purposes , such as kb_a `` help '' kb_command_economy in emacs .many more of the control kb_code_(cryptography) have been given meanings quite different from their original ones . the `` escape '' kb_character_(computing) ( esc , kb_code 27 ) , for example , was kb_intention originally to allow sending kb_other_(philosophy) control kb_character_(computing) as literals instead of invoking their kb_meaning_(linguistics) . this is the same kb_meaning_(linguistics) of `` escape '' encountered in url encodings , kb_c_(programming_language) kb_string_section , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_systems_analysis where certain kb_character_(computing) have kb_a reserved kb_meaning_(linguistics) . over kb_time_(magazine) this kb_meaning_(linguistics) has been co-opted and has eventually been changed . in kb_modern_history use , an esc sent to the kb_computer_terminal usually indicates the start of kb_a kb_command_economy sequence usually in the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_a so-called `` kb_ansi_escape_code kb_code '' ( or , more properly , kb_a `` kb_control_sequence_introducer sequence introducer '' ) from ecma-48 ( kb_1972_wimbledon_championships ) and its successors , beginning with esc followed by kb_a `` < nowiki > [ < /nowiki > '' ( left-bracket ) kb_character_(computing) . an esc sent from the kb_computer_terminal is most often used as an kb_out-of-band_data kb_character_(computing) used to terminate an operation , as in the kb_text_editor_and_corrector and kb_vi text editors . in kb_graphical_user_interface kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) interface ( kb_graphical_user_interface ) and kb_window_(computing) kb_systems_analysis , esc generally kb_causes_of_autism an kb_application_(computing) to abort its kb_electric_current operation or to kb_exit_(system_call) ( terminate ) altogether .the inherent ambiguity of many control kb_character_(computing) , combined with their historical usage , created kb_problems_(aristotle) when transferring `` kb_plain_text text '' kb_file_(tool) between kb_systems_analysis . the best example of this is the kb_newline problem on various operating kb_systems_analysis . kb_teleprinter machines required that kb_a kb_line_(geometry) of text kb_beryllium terminated with both `` kb_carriage_return return '' ( which moves the printhead to kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the kb_line_(geometry) ) and `` kb_line_feed '' ( which advances the paper kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_line_(geometry) without moving the printhead ) . the kb_toponymy `` kb_carriage_return return '' comes from the kb_fact that on kb_a kb_manual_(music) kb_typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the kb_positional_notation where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary . the entire carriage had to kb_beryllium pushed ( returned ) to the kb_right-wing_politics in kb_order_(biology) to kb_positional_notation the kb_left-wing_politics margin of the paper for the kb_next kb_line_(geometry) .kb_declination operating kb_systems_analysis ( kb_os/8 , kb_rt-11 , kb_rsx-11 , kb_rsts/e , kb_tops-10 , etc . ) used both kb_character_(computing) to kb_mark_waugh the end of kb_a kb_line_(geometry) kb_sulfate that the console kb_analyzer ( originally kb_teleprinter machines ) would kb_cold_working . by the kb_time_(magazine) so-called `` kb_glass ttys '' ( later called crts or terminals ) came along , the kb_fan_convention was kb_sulfate kb_water_well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the kb_fan_convention . when kb_gary_kildall kildall created kb_cp/m kb_he_(letter) was inspired by some kb_command_economy kb_line_(geometry) interface conventions used in kb_declination 's kb_rt-11 . until the introduction of kb_pc_dos kb_dos in 1981 , kb_ibm had no kb_hand in this because their 1970s operating kb_systems_analysis used kb_ebcdic instead of kb_ascii and they were oriented toward punch-card input and kb_line_(geometry) printer output on which the kb_concept of kb_carriage_return return was meaningless . kb_ibm 's kb_pc_dos kb_dos ( also marketed as kb_ms-dos by kb_microsoft ) inherited the kb_fan_convention by kb_virtue of kb_being loosely based on kb_cp/m , and kb_microsoft_windows inherited kb_it from kb_ms-dos .unfortunately , requiring kb_2_(number) kb_character_(computing) to kb_mark_waugh the end of kb_a kb_line_(geometry) introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each kb_character_(computing) when encountered alone . to simplify matters kb_plain_text text kb_big_data streams , including kb_file_(tool) , on kb_multics used kb_line_feed ( lf ) alone as kb_a kb_line_(geometry) kb_terminator_(solar) . kb_unix and kb_unix-like kb_systems_analysis , and kb_amiga kb_systems_analysis , kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome this kb_fan_convention from kb_multics . the original kb_macintosh_os , kb_apple_dos , and kb_prodos , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , used kb_carriage_return return ( cr ) alone as kb_a kb_line_(geometry) kb_terminator_(solar) ; however , since kb_apple_inc. replaced these operating kb_systems_analysis with the unix-based kb_macos kb_operating_system system , they now use kb_line_feed ( lf ) as kb_water_well . the kb_radio shack kb_trs-80 also used kb_a lone cr to terminate lines .computers attached to the kb_arpanet included machines running operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_tops-10 and kb_tops-20#tenex using cr-lf kb_line_(geometry) endings , machines running operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_multics using lf kb_line_(geometry) endings , and machines running operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_os/360 that represented lines as kb_a kb_character_(computing) count followed by the kb_character_(computing) of the kb_line_(geometry) and that used kb_ebcdic rather than kb_ascii . the kb_telnet protocol kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity an kb_ascii `` kb_network_virtual_terminal virtual kb_computer_terminal '' ( nvt ) , kb_sulfate that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and kb_character_(computing) sets could kb_beryllium kb_catalyst_support by transmitting kb_a standard text kb_text_formatting over the network . kb_telnet used kb_ascii along with cr-lf kb_line_(geometry) endings , and software using kb_other_(philosophy) conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt . the kb_file_transfer_protocol transfer protocol kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome the kb_telnet protocol , including use of the kb_network_virtual_terminal virtual kb_computer_terminal , for use when transmitting commands and transferring kb_big_data in the default kb_ascii kb_musical_mode . this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols , and to kb_other_(philosophy) network protocols , such as those used for e-mail and the kb_world_wide_web kb_world_wide_web , on kb_systems_analysis not using the nvt 's cr-lf line-ending kb_fan_convention .the pdp-6 monitor , and its pdp-10 successor kb_tops-10 , used control-z ( sub ) as an kb_end-of-file indication for input from kb_a kb_computer_terminal . some operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_cp/m tracked file kb_length only in units of kb_disk_(mathematics) kb_periodic_table_block and used control-z to kb_mark_waugh the end of the actual text in the file . for these reasons , eof , or kb_end-of-file , was used colloquially and conventionally as kb_a kb_three-letter_acronym kb_acronym for control-z instead of substitute . the end-of-text kb_code ( kb_end-of-text_character ) , also known as kb_control-c , was inappropriate for kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of reasons , while using kb_carboxybenzyl as the kb_control_code kb_code to end kb_a file is analogous to kb_it ending the kb_alphabet and serves as kb_a very convenient kb_mnemonic_device kb_aid . kb_a kb_history common and still prevalent kb_fan_convention uses the kb_end-of-text_character kb_code kb_fan_convention to interrupt and halt kb_a kb_program_(computing) via an input kb_data_stream , usually from kb_a keyboard .in kb_vitamin_c library and kb_unix conventions , the kb_null_character is used to terminate text kb_string_section ; such null-terminated kb_string_section can kb_beryllium known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz , where here kb_carboxybenzyl stands for `` kb_0_(number) '' .kb_other_(philosophy) representations might kb_beryllium used by specialist equipment , for example kb_iso_2047 graphics or kb_hexadecimal kb_grammatical_number .kb_code_(cryptography) 20 to 7e , known as the printable kb_character_(computing) , represent kb_letter_(alphabet) , digits , punctuation marks , and kb_a few kb_miscellaneous_symbols kb_symbols . there are 95 printable kb_character_(computing) in total .kb_code 20 , the `` kb_space '' kb_character_(computing) , denotes the kb_space between kb_lexical_semantics , as produced by the kb_space bar of kb_a keyboard . since the kb_space kb_character_(computing) is considered an invisible graphic ( rather than kb_a kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) ) kb_it is listed in the table kb_#ecclesiastical_history instead of in the previous kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) .kb_code 7f corresponds to the non-printable `` kb_delete_key '' ( del ) kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) and is therefore omitted from this chart ; kb_it is covered in the previous kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) 's chart . kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet versions of kb_ascii used the up kb_arrow_(weapon) instead of the kb_caret ( 5e ) and the kb_left-wing_politics kb_arrow_(weapon) instead of the kb_underscore ( 5f ) .] ]kb_ascii was kb_first_trimester used commercially during 1963 as kb_a seven-bit kb_teleprinter kb_code for kb_american_telephone_&_telegraph & kb_telegraph 's twx ( teletypewriter exchange ) network . twx originally used the kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet five-bit kb_ita2 , which was also used by the competing kb_telex kb_teleprinter system . kb_robert_william_bemer bemer introduced features such as the kb_escape_character sequence . kb_histidine kb_kingdom_of_great_britain colleague kb_hugh_mcgregor_ross mcgregor ross helped to popularize this kb_cold_working according to bemer , `` kb_sulfate much kb_sulfate that the kb_code that was to become kb_ascii was kb_first_trimester called the `` bemer–ross kb_code '' in kb_europe '' . because of kb_histidine extensive kb_cold_working on kb_ascii , bemer has been called `` the kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) of kb_ascii '' .on kb_march 11 , kb_from_the_earth_to_the_moon_(miniseries)#episodes , kb_usa_davis_cup_team kb_president_of_the_united_states

recording the standard kb_code for kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) interchange on kb_magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in kb_apollo_guidance_computer operations .all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the kb_federal_government_of_the_united_states kb_inventory on and after july 1 , 1969 , must have the capability to use the standard kb_code for kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) interchange and the formats prescribed by the kb_magnetic tape and kb_punched_tape tape kb_corporate_social_responsibility when these kb_medes are used .kb_ascii was the most common kb_character_encoding on the kb_world_wide_web kb_world_wide_web until december kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final , when kb_utf-8 encoding surpassed kb_it ; kb_utf-8 is kb_backward_compatibility compatible with kb_ascii .as kb_apollo_guidance_computer kb_technology kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) throughout the kb_world , different kb_standardization and corporations kb_adaptation many variations of kb_ascii to facilitate the expression of non-english languages that used roman-based alphabets . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) could kb_class_(biology) some of these variations as `` kb_ascii extensions '' , although some misuse that kb_terminology to represent all variants , including those that do not preserve kb_ascii 's character-map in the 7-bit range . furthermore , the kb_ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as kb_ascii .from early in its development , kb_ascii was kb_intention to kb_beryllium just kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of several national variants of an international kb_character_(computing) kb_code standard .kb_other_(philosophy) international kb_standardization have ratified kb_character_(computing) encodings such as kb_iso_646 ( 1967 ) that are kb_identical_particles or nearly kb_identical_particles to kb_ascii , with extensions for kb_character_(computing) outside the kb_english_alphabet and kb_symbols used outside the united kb_sovereign_state , such as the kb_symbol for the kb_united_kingdom kb_kingdom_(biology) 's kb_pound_sterling ( kb_pound_sterling ) . almost every kb_country_music needed an adapted version of kb_ascii , since kb_ascii suited the needs of only the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) and kb_a few kb_other_(philosophy) countries . for example , kb_canada had its own version that kb_catalyst_support kb_france kb_character_(computing) .many kb_other_(philosophy) countries kb_adaptation variants of kb_ascii to include non-english kb_letter_(alphabet) ( e.g . kb_é , kb_ñ , kb_ß , kb_ł ) , kb_aruban_florin kb_symbols ( e.g . kb_pound_sterling , kb_¥ ) , etc . kb_episcopal_see also kb_yuscii ( yugoslavia ) .kb_it would share most kb_character_(computing) in common , but assign kb_other_(philosophy) locally useful kb_character_(computing) to several kb_code points reserved for `` national use '' . however , the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii-1963 and kb_international_organization_for_standardization 's kb_first_trimester acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused kb_ascii 's choices for the national use kb_character_(computing) to seem to kb_beryllium kb_de_facto kb_corporate_social_responsibility for the kb_world , causing kb_confusion and incompatibility once kb_other_(philosophy) countries did begin to make their own assignments to these kb_code points .iso/iec 646 , like kb_ascii , is kb_a 7-bit kb_character_(computing) kb_set_(mythology) . kb_it does not make any additional kb_code_(cryptography) kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance , kb_sulfate the same kb_code points encoded different kb_character_(computing) in different countries . escape kb_code_(cryptography) were kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity to indicate which national variant kb_applied_science to kb_a piece of text , but they were rarely used , kb_sulfate kb_it was often impossible to know what variant to kb_cold_working with and , therefore , which kb_character_(computing) kb_a kb_code represented , and in kb_general_(united_states) , text-processing kb_systems_analysis could kb_coping_(psychology) with only kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) variant anyway .because the bracket and kb_brace_(punctuation) kb_character_(computing) of kb_ascii were assigned to `` national use '' kb_code points that were used for accented kb_letter_(alphabet) in kb_other_(philosophy) national variants of iso/iec 646 , kb_a kb_german_language , kb_france , or kb_sweden , etc . kb_programmer using their national variant of iso/iec 646 , rather than kb_ascii , had to write , and thus kb_walter_read , something such asinstead ofkb_vitamin_c trigraphs were created to solve this problem for kb_ansi_c , although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use . many programmers kept their computers on us-ascii , kb_sulfate plain-text in kb_sweden , kb_german_language etc . ( for example , in e-mail or kb_usenet ) contained `` { , } '' and similar variants in the middle of kb_lexical_semantics , something those programmers got used to . for example , kb_a kb_sweden kb_programmer mailing another kb_programmer asking if they should kb_go_(game) for lunch , could get `` kb_neutron { jag har sm|rg } sar '' as the answer , which should kb_beryllium `` nä jag har smörgåsar '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` no kb_iodine 've got sandwiches '' .eventually , as 8- , kb_16-bit and kb_32-bit ( and later kb_64-bit ) computers began to replace kb_12-bit , kb_18-bit and kb_36-bit computers as the kb_norm_(mathematics) , kb_it became common to use an kb_8-bit kb_byte to store each kb_character_(computing) in kb_memory , providing an opportunity for extended , kb_8-bit relatives of kb_ascii . in most kb_noun_case these kb_adaptation as kb_truth extensions of kb_ascii , leaving the original character-mapping intact , but adding additional kb_character_(computing) definitions after the kb_first_trimester 128 ( i.e. , 7-bit ) kb_character_(computing) .encodings include kb_iscii ( kb_indian_subcontinent ) , kb_viscii ( kb_vietnam ) . although these encodings are sometimes referred to as kb_ascii , kb_truth kb_ascii is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity strictly only by the kb_american_national_standards_institute standard .most early home kb_computer_systems kb_adaptation their own kb_8-bit kb_character_(computing) sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs , and often filled in some or all of the control kb_character_(computing) from 0 to 31 with more

underlayer if they want , and change the profile of the kb_arm . ''kb_3d_computer_graphics animation is kb_digital_media modeled and manipulated by an kb_animator . the kb_animator usually starts by creating kb_a 3d kb_polygon_mesh to manipulate . kb_a mesh typically includes many kb_vertex_(geometry) that are connected by edges and faces , which give the visual kb_appearance_(philosophy) of kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism to kb_a 3d kb_space_debris or 3d environment . sometimes , the mesh is given an internal kb_digital_data skeletal kb_structure called an kb_armature_(computer_animation) that can kb_beryllium used to control the mesh by weighting the kb_vertex_(geometry) . this process is called rigging and can kb_beryllium used in conjunction with keyframes to create kb_movement_(sign_language) .kb_other_(philosophy) techniques can kb_beryllium kb_applied_science , mathematical functions ( e.g. , kb_gravity_(2013_film) , kb_grammatical_particle simulations ) , simulated fur or hair , and effects , kb_fire_(classical_element) and kb_fluid_animationan kb_animator is an kb_artist kb_world_health_organization creates kb_a visual sequence ( or kb_audio-visual if added kb_sound ) of kb_cross-platform_software sequential images that generate the illusion of kb_movement_(sign_language) , that is , an animation . animations are currently in many areas of kb_technology and kb_video , such as kb_film , kb_television , kb_video_games or kb_the_internet kb_internet . generally , these works require the collaboration of several animators . the methods to create these images depend on the kb_animator and kb_carpel that kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) wants to achieve ( with images generated by kb_apollo_guidance_computer , manually ... ) .animators can kb_beryllium divided into animators of kb_character_(computing) ( artists kb_world_health_organization are specialized in the movements , kb_dialogue and acting of the kb_character_(computing) ) and animators of special effects ( for example vehicles , kb_machinery or kb_natural_number kb_phenomenon such as kb_water , kb_snow , kb_rain ) .the creation of non-trivial animation works ( i.e. , longer than kb_a few seconds ) has kb_adaptation as kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_filmmaking , with certain unique aspects . kb_trait_(biology) common to both live-action and animated kb_feature_film kb_adventure_film are labor-intensity and kb_high_middle_ages production costs .the most important difference is that once kb_a kb_film is in the production kb_phase_(matter) , the kb_marginal_cost cost of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) more shot is higher for animated kb_adventure_film than live-action kb_adventure_film . kb_it is relatively easy for kb_a director to kb_amplitude-shift_keying for kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) more kb_take during kb_principal_photography photography of kb_a live-action kb_film , but every kb_take on an animated kb_film must kb_beryllium manually rendered by animators ( although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by kb_modern_history kb_computer_animation ) . kb_it is pointless for kb_a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating kb_a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the kb_film . thus , animation studios starting with kb_walt_disney_animation_studios began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where kb_storyboard artists develop every kb_single_bond scene through storyboards , then handing the kb_film over to the animators only after the production team is kb_satisfiability that all the scenes make kb_word_sense as kb_a whole . while live-action kb_adventure_film are now also storyboarded , they enjoy more kb_latitude to depart from storyboards ( i.e. , kb_real-time_computing improvisation ) .another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain kb_a kb_film 's consistency from start to finish , even as kb_adventure_film have grown longer and teams have grown larger . animators , like all artists , necessarily have kb_individual kb_art_movement , but must subordinate their individuality in kb_a kb_consistent way to whatever kb_carpel is employed on kb_a kb_particular kb_film . since the early 1980s , teams of about 500 to 600 kb_people_(american_magazine) , of whom 50 to 70 are animators , typically have created feature-length animated kb_adventure_film . kb_it is relatively easy for kb_2_(number) or kb_triliteral artists to match their kb_art_movement ; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult .this problem is usually solved by having kb_a separate kb_group_(periodic_table) of visual development artists develop an overall kb_look_(american_magazine) and palette for each kb_film before animation begins . kb_character_(computing) designers on the visual development team draw kb_rutherford_model sheets to show how each kb_character_(computing) should kb_look_(american_magazine) like with different facial expressions , posed in different positions , and viewed from different angles . on traditionally animated projects , maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators kb_episcopal_see how kb_character_(computing) would kb_look_(american_magazine) from different angles .unlike live-action kb_adventure_film , animated kb_adventure_film were traditionally kb_adaptation beyond the synopsis stage through the kb_storyboard kb_text_formatting ; the kb_storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the kb_film . in the early kb_1960s_in_the_united_states , animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write kb_screenplays ( while also continuing to use story departments ) and kb_screenplays had become commonplace for animated kb_adventure_film by the late 1980s .criticism of animation has been common in kb_medes and kb_film since its kb_inception_(film) . with its popularity , kb_a kb_prespa_lake amount of criticism has arisen , especially animated kb_feature_film kb_adventure_film . many concerns of kb_cultural_anthropology kb_representation_(arts) , kb_psychology effects on children have been brought up around the animation kb_industry , which has remained rather kb_politics_of_albania unchanged and stagnant since its kb_inception_(film) into kb_mainstream_(terminology) kb_albanian_culture .as with any kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_medes , animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field . the original awards for animation were presented by the kb_academy_of_motion_picture_arts_and_sciences kb_motion_(physics) picture kb_arts and kb_sciences for animated shorts from the year 1932 , during the 5th kb_academy_awards kb_function_(biology) . the kb_first_trimester winner of the kb_academy_awards was the short `` kb_flowers_and_trees and kb_trees '' , kb_a production by kb_walt_disney_productions kb_walt_disney_animation_studios productions . the kb_academy_awards for kb_a feature-length animated kb_motion_(physics) picture was only instituted for the year 2001 , and awarded during the 74th kb_academy_awards in 2002. kb_it was won by the kb_film `` kb_shrek '' , produced by kb_dreamworks and kb_pacific_data_images images . disney/pixar have produced the most kb_adventure_film either to win or kb_beryllium nominated for the award . the kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of both awards can kb_beryllium obtained here :several kb_other_(philosophy) countries have instituted an award for best-animated kb_feature_film as part of their national kb_film awards : kb_africa_movie_academy_award_for_best_animation kb_academy_awards for best animation ( since kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 ) , kb_bafta_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film ( since kb_winter_olympics_2006 ) , kb_césar_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film ( since 2011 ) , kb_golden_rooster_award_for_best_animation award for best animation ( since 1981 ) , kb_goya_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film ( since 1989 ) , kb_japan_academy_prize_for_animation_of_the_year prize for animation of the year ( since kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final ) , kb_national_film_award_for_best_animated_film kb_film award for best animated kb_film ( since kb_winter_olympics_2006 ) . also since kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final , the kb_asia_pacific_screen_award_for_best_animated_feature_film kb_screening_(medicine) award for best animated kb_feature_film has been awarded at the kb_asia_pacific_screen_awards kb_screening_(medicine) awards . since kb_2009_in_science , the kb_european_film_awards awards have awarded the kb_european_film_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film .the kb_annie_award award is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation . unlike the kb_academy_awards , the annie awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any kb_other_(philosophy) field of technical and artistic endeavor . they were re-organized in kb_1992_davis_cup to create kb_a kb_new_world field for best animated kb_i_shot_andy_warhol . the 1990s winners were dominated by walt kb_walt_disney_animation_studios , however , newer studios , kb_light-emitting_diode by kb_pixar & kb_dreamworks , have now begun to consistently vie for this award . the kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of awardees is as follows :category : cartooningcategory : kb_article_(grammar) containing kb_video kb_clips_(software)category : kb_film and kb_video technologyapollokb_apollo_program ( kb_attica , kb_ionic_crystal , and kb_homeric_greek : , `` apollōn '' ( ) ;

, `` phoibos '' ) , literally `` bright '' . kb_it was very commonly used by both the kb_greeks and kb_roman_empire for kb_apollo_program 's role as the kb_god of kb_light . like kb_other_(philosophy) kb_ancient_greek kb_deities , kb_he_(letter) had kb_a kb_grammatical_number of others kb_applied_science to him , reflecting the kb_variety_(magazine) of roles , duties , and aspects ascribed to the kb_god . however , while kb_apollo_program has kb_a great kb_grammatical_number of appellations in kb_greek_mythology , only kb_a few occur in kb_latin_literature .kb_apollo_program 's birthplace was kb_cynthus cynthus on the kb_island of kb_deloskb_delphi and kb_actiumkb_apollo_program was worshipped throughout the kb_roman_empire . in the traditionally kb_celts lands , kb_he_(letter) was most often seen as kb_a kb_healing and kb_sun kb_god . kb_he_(letter) was often equated with kb_list_of_celtic_godsthe kb_cult_(religious_practice) centers of kb_apollo_program in kb_greece , kb_delphi and kb_delos , date from the 8th century bce . the kb_delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to kb_artemis , kb_apollo_program 's twin sister . at kb_delphi , kb_apollo_program was kb_veneration as the slayer of kb_pytho . for the kb_greeks , kb_apollo_program was all the kb_deity in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) and through the kb_century_(cricket) kb_he_(letter) acquired different functions which could originate from different kb_deity . in kb_archaic_greece kb_greece kb_he_(letter) was the kb_prophet , the kb_oracular kb_god kb_world_health_organization in older times was connected with `` kb_healing '' . in kb_classical_greece kb_he_(letter) was the kb_god of kb_light and of kb_music , but in popular kb_religion kb_he_(letter) had kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_function_(biology) to keep away kb_evil . kb_walter_burkert burkert discerned kb_triliteral components in the kb_prehistory of kb_apollo_program kb_achilles#worship , which kb_he_(letter) termed `` kb_a dorian-northwest kb_ancient_greek component , kb_a cretan-minoan component , and kb_a syro-hittite component . ''from kb_histidine kb_eastern_hemisphere kb_evolution kb_apollo_program brought the kb_art of kb_inspection of `` kb_symbols and kb_omen '' ( σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα : `` sēmeia kai terata '' ) , and of the kb_observation of the omens of the days . the inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from kb_anatolia . the kb_ritualism_in_the_church_of_england belonged to kb_apollo_program from kb_operation_barbarossa beginning . the kb_greeks created the kb_legalism_(western_philosophy) , the supervision of the kb_order_(biology) of the kb_deity , and the demand for kb_moderation and kb_harmony . kb_apollo_program became the kb_god of shining youth , kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_beauty , kb_fine_(penalty) kb_arts , kb_philosophy , kb_moderation , spiritual-life , the protector of

of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to kb_cure kb_disease . later the kb_greeks knew the original kb_meaning_(linguistics) of the relevant song `` kb_paean '' ( ) . the magicians were also called `` seer-doctors '' ( ) , and they used an ecstatic prophetic kb_art which was used exactly by the kb_god kb_apollo_program at the kb_oracle_machine .in the `` kb_iliad '' , kb_apollo_program is the healer under the kb_deity , but kb_he_(letter) is also the bringer of kb_disease and kb_death with kb_histidine arrows , similar to the kb_function_(biology) of the kb_vedas kb_god of kb_disease kb_rudra . kb_he_(letter) sends kb_a kb_plague_(disease) ( ) to the kb_achaeans_(homer) . the kb_god kb_world_health_organization sends kb_a kb_disease can also prevent kb_it ; therefore , when kb_it kb_organ_stop , they make kb_a purifying ceremony and offer him kb_a kb_hecatomb to ward off kb_evil . when the kb_oath of kb_histidine kb_priest appeases , they pray and with kb_a song they call their own kb_god , the `` kb_paean '' .some common epithets of kb_apollo_program as kb_a healer are `` paion '' ( literally `` healer '' or `` helper '' ) `` epikourios '' ( , `` succouring '' ) , `` oulios '' ( , `` healer , baleful '' ) and `` loimios '' ( , `` of kb_the_plague kb_plague_(disease) '' ) . in kb_classical_antiquity , kb_histidine kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_function_(biology) in popular kb_religion was to keep away kb_evil , and was therefore called `` apotropaios '' ( , `` averting kb_evil '' ) and `` alexikakos '' ( `` keeping off ill '' ; from kb_verb + kb_noun ) . in later writers , kb_the_word_(free_love) word , usually spelled `` kb_paean '' , becomes kb_a mere kb_epithet of kb_apollo_program in kb_histidine capacity as kb_a kb_god of kb_healing .kb_homer illustrated paeon the kb_god , and the song both of kb_apotropaic_magic kb_thanksgiving_day_(united_states) or triumph . such songs were originally addressed to kb_apollo_program , and afterwards to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_deity : to kb_dionysus , to kb_helios , to kb_apollo_program 's son kb_asclepius the healer . about the 4th century bce , the kb_paean became merely kb_a kb_chemical_formula of adulation ; its kb_space_debris was either to implore protection against kb_disease and misfortune , or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered . kb_it was in this way that kb_apollo_program had become recognised as the kb_god of kb_music . kb_apollo_program 's role as the slayer of the kb_python_(mythology) kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_histidine kb_continental_association with kb_battle_abbey and victory ; hence kb_it became the kb_roman_empirethe connection with the dorians and their initiation festival `` kb_apellai '' is reinforced by the month `` apellaios '' in northwest kb_ancient_greek calendars . the family-festival was dedicated to kb_apollo_program ( kb_dorians : ) . `` apellaios '' is the month of these rites , and apellon is the `` megistos kb_kouros '' ( the great kb_kouros ) . however kb_it can explain only the kb_dorians kb_type_(biology) of the kb_toponymy , which is connected with the kb_ancient_macedonian_language word `` kb_pella '' ( kb_pella ) , `` stone '' . stones played an important part in the kb_cult_(religious_practice) of the kb_god , especially in the kb_oracular shrine of kb_delphi ( kb_omphalos ) .the `` kb_homeric_hymn '' represents kb_apollo_program as kb_a kb_northern_hemisphere intruder . kb_histidine kb_arrival_(abba_album) must have occurred during the `` kb_greek_dark_ages ages '' that followed the destruction of the kb_mycenaean_civilization , and kb_histidine conflict with kb_gaia ( mother kb_earth ) was represented by the legend of kb_histidine slaying her kb_decay_product the serpent kb_python_(mythology) .the kb_earth kb_deity had kb_power_(physics) over the ghostly kb_world , and kb_it is believed that she was the kb_deity behind the kb_oracle . the older tales mentioned kb_2_(number) dragons kb_world_health_organization were perhaps intentionally conflated . kb_a female dragon kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_delphyne ( ; kb_cf. . , `` kb_womb '' ) , and kb_a kb_male serpent kb_typhon ( ; from , `` to smoke '' ) , the adversary of kb_zeus in the kb_titanomachy , kb_world_health_organization the narrators confused with kb_python_(mythology) . kb_python_(mythology) was the good kb_daemon_(classical_mythology) ( ἀγαθὸς δαίμων ) of the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina as kb_it appears in kb_minoan_civilization kb_religion , but she was represented as kb_a dragon , as often happens in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_european_folklore as kb_water_well as in the kb_east_africa .kb_apollo_program and kb_histidine sister kb_artemis can bring kb_death with their arrows . the kb_human_fertilization that diseases and kb_death come from invisible kb_shot_(filmmaking) sent by kb_supernatural beings , or magicians is common in kb_germanic_languages and kb_norse_mythology kb_mythology . in kb_greek_mythology kb_artemis was the kb_leader ( , `` kb_hegemon '' ) of the kb_nymphs , kb_world_health_organization had similar functions with the kb_norse_mythology kb_elf . the `` elf-shot '' originally indicated kb_disease or kb_death attributed to the kb_elf , but kb_it was later attested denoting stone arrow-heads which were used by witches to harm kb_people_(american_magazine) , and also for kb_healing rituals .the kb_vedas kb_rudra has some similar functions with kb_apollo_program . the terrible kb_god is called `` the kb_archery '' , and the kb_bow_river is also an attribute of kb_shiva . kb_rudra could bring diseases with kb_histidine arrows , but kb_he_(letter) was able to free kb_people_(american_magazine)

from the kb_mycenaean_greece age . in historical times , the kb_priests of kb_delphi were called kb_labëria ( kb_alkyl ) yadai , `` the double-axe men '' , which indicates kb_minoan_civilization kb_evolution . the double-axe , kb_labrys , was the holy kb_symbol of the kb_crete kb_labyrinth . the kb_homeric_hymn adds that kb_apollo_program appeared as kb_a kb_dolphin and carried kb_crete kb_priests to kb_delphi , where they evidently transferred their kb_religion practices . `` kb_apollo_program delphinios '' or `` delphidios '' was kb_a sea-god especially worshiped in kb_crete and in the kb_islands_(regional_unit) . kb_apollo_program 's sister kb_artemis , kb_world_health_organization was the kb_ancient_greek kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of hunting , is kb_interpretatio_graeca with kb_britomartis ( kb_diktynna ) , the kb_minoan_civilization `` mistress of the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing '' . in her kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century depictions she is accompanied by the `` mister of the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing '' , kb_a kb_male kb_god of hunting kb_world_health_organization had the kb_bow_river as kb_histidine attribute . kb_histidine original kb_toponymy is unknown , but kb_it seems that kb_he_(letter) was absorbed by the more popular kb_apollo_program , kb_world_health_organization stood by the virgin `` mistress of the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing '' , becoming her brother .the kb_old_testament kb_oracle_machine in kb_delphi seem to kb_beryllium connected with kb_a local kb_tradition of the kb_priesthood , and there is not clear kb_evidence_(law) that kb_a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina . this kb_light-emitting_diode some scholars to the kb_eschatocol that kb_pythia carried on the rituals in kb_a kb_consistent procedure through many kb_century_(cricket) , according to the local kb_tradition . in that regard , the mythical seeress kb_sibyl of kb_sultanate_of_rum kb_evolution , with her ecstatic kb_art , looks unrelated to the kb_oracle itself . however , the kb_ancient_greek_astronomy is referring to the kb_existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves , which seem to kb_beryllium kb_confirmation by recent studies .kb_plato describes the priestesses of kb_delphi and kb_dodona as frenzied women , obsessed by `` kb_mania '' ( , `` kb_frenzy '' ) , kb_a kb_ancient_greek word kb_he_(letter) connected with `` mantis '' ( , `` kb_prophet '' ) . frenzied women like sibyls from whose lips the kb_god speaks are recorded in the kb_near_east kb_east_africa as kb_mari,_syria in the kb_2nd_millennium_bc bc . although kb_crete had contacts with kb_mari,_syria from 2000 bc , there is no kb_evidence_(law) that the ecstatic prophetic kb_art existed during the kb_minoan_civilization and kb_mycenaean_greece ages . kb_it is more probable that this kb_art was introduced later from kb_anatoliakb_a non-greek kb_evolution of kb_apollo_program has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) been assumed in scholarship . the kb_toponymy of kb_apollo_program 's mother kb_leto has kb_lydian_language kb_evolution , and she was worshipped on the coasts of kb_anatolia . the inspiration kb_oracular kb_cult_(religious_practice) was probably introduced into kb_greece from kb_anatolia , which is the kb_evolution of kb_sibyl , and where existed some of the oldest kb_oracular shrines . omens , kb_symbols , purifications , and exorcisms appear in kb_old_testament assyro-babylonian kb_literature , and these rituals were kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) into the kb_roman_empire of the kb_hittites . in kb_a kb_hittites text is mentioned that the kb_king invited kb_a babylonian priestess for kb_a certain `` purification '' .kb_a similar story is mentioned by kb_plutarch . kb_he_(letter) writes that the kb_crete kb_prophet kb_epimenides purified kb_athens after the pollution brought by the kb_alcmeonidae , and that the kb_prophet 's expertise in sacrifices and kb_reform_judaism of funeral practices were of great help to kb_solon in kb_histidine kb_reform_judaism of the kb_athenian kb_state_of_matter . the story indicates that kb_epimenides was probably heir to the kb_shamanism#asia religions of kb_asia_(roman_province) , and proves , together with the kb_homeric_hymn , that kb_crete had kb_a resisting kb_religion up to historical times . kb_it seems that these rituals were dormant in kb_greece , and they were reinforced when the kb_greeks migrated to kb_anatolia .kb_homer pictures kb_apollo_program on the side of the kb_troy , fighting against the kb_achaeans_(homer) , during the kb_trojan_war . kb_he_(letter) is pictured as kb_a terrible kb_god , less trusted by the kb_greeks than kb_other_(philosophy) kb_deity . the kb_god seems to kb_beryllium related to `` appaliunas '' , kb_a tutelary kb_god of kb_wilusa ( kb_troy ) in kb_anatolia , but kb_the_word_(free_love) word is not complete . the stones found in front of the gates of kb_homeric kb_troy were the kb_symbols of kb_apollo_program . kb_a kb_western_esotericism kb_sultanate_of_rum kb_evolution may also kb_beryllium bolstered by references to the parallel kb_achilles#worship of `` artimus '' ( kb_artemis ) and `` qλdãns '' , whose kb_toponymy may kb_beryllium kb_cognate with the kb_hittites and kb_dorians kb_theory_of_forms , in surviving kb_lydian_language kb_literature '' . '' however , recent scholars have kb_casting_(metalworking) doubt on the identification of `` qλdãns '' with kb_apollo_program .the kb_greeks gave to him the kb_toponymy `` kb_agyieus '' as the protector kb_god of kb_state_school places and houses kb_world_health_organization wards off kb_evil , and kb_histidine kb_symbol was kb_a tapered stone or kb_column_of_antoninus_pius . however , while usually kb_ancient_greek festivals were celebrated at the kb_full_moon kb_moon , all the feasts of kb_apollo_program were celebrated at the seventh day of the month , and the kb_emphasis_(typography) given to that day ( `` sibutu '' ) indicates kb_a babylonian kb_evolution .the kb_bronze_age#age_sub-divisions kb_bronze_age ( from 1700 to 1200 bce ) kb_hittites and kb_hurrian `` kb_aplu_(deity) '' was kb_a kb_god of kb_plague_(disease) , invoked during kb_plague_(disease) years . here we have an kb_apotropaic_magic situation , where kb_a kb_god originally bringing kb_the_plague kb_plague_(disease) was invoked to end kb_it . kb_aplu_(deity) , kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` the son of '' , was kb_a kb_title given to the kb_god kb_nergal , kb_world_health_organization was linked to the babylonian kb_solar_deity the kb_sun kb_shamash . kb_homer interprets kb_apollo_program as kb_a terrible kb_god ( ) kb_world_health_organization brings kb_death and kb_disease with kb_histidine arrows , but kb_world_health_organization can also heal , possessing kb_a kb_magic_(supernatural) kb_art that separates him from the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_ancient_greek kb_deity . in `` kb_iliad '' , kb_histidine kb_priest prays to `` kb_apollo_smintheus '' , the kb_mouse kb_god kb_world_health_organization retains an older kb_agriculture kb_function_(biology) as the protector from field rats . all these functions , including the kb_function_(biology) of the healer-god kb_paeanunusually among the kb_summer_olympics kb_deities , kb_apollo_program had kb_2_(number) kb_cult_(religious_practice) sites that had widespread influence : kb_delos and kb_delphi . in kb_cult_(religious_practice) practice , kb_delos kb_apollo_program and kb_pythian_apollo kb_apollo_program ( the kb_apollo_program of kb_delphi ) were kb_sulfate distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality . kb_apollo_program 's kb_cult_(religious_practice) was already fully established when written sources commenced , about 650 bce . kb_apollo_program became extremely important to the kb_ancient_greek kb_world as an kb_oracular kb_deity in the kb_archaic_greece period , and the kb_frequency of kb_theophoric_names names such as `` apollodorus '' or `` apollonios '' and cities kb_english_alphabet#letter_names `` kb_sozopol '' testify to kb_histidine popularity . kb_oracular sanctuaries to kb_apollo_program were established in kb_other_(philosophy) sites . in the 2nd and 3rd century kb_council_of_europe , those at kb_didyma and kb_clarus pronounced the so-called `` theological kb_oracle_machine '' , in which kb_apollo_program confirms that all kb_deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing , highest kb_deity . `` in the 3rd century , kb_apollo_program fell silent . kb_julian_the_apostate apostatekb_apollo_program had kb_a famous kb_oracle in kb_delphi , and kb_other_(philosophy) notable ones in kb_clarus and kb_branchidae . kb_histidine kb_oracular shrine in kb_abae in kb_phocis , where kb_he_(letter) bore the toponymic kb_epithet `` kb_abaeus '' ( , `` kb_apollon_smyrni_f.c. abaios '' ) , was important enough to kb_beryllium consulted by kb_croesus .kb_histidine kb_oracular shrines include :kb_oracle_machine were also given by sons of kb_apollo_program .many kb_egyptian_temple were dedicated to kb_apollo_program in kb_greece and the kb_greek_colonies . they show the kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) of the kb_cult_(religious_practice) of kb_apollo_program and the kb_evolution of the kb_ancient_greek kb_architecture , which was mostly based on the rightness of kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism and on mathematical kb_foreign_relations_of_albania . some of the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century kb_egyptian_temple , especially in kb_crete , do not belong to any kb_ancient_greek kb_order_(biology) . kb_it seems that the kb_first_trimester peripteral kb_egyptian_temple were rectangular wooden kb_structural_analysis . the different wooden kb_chemical_element were considered kb_divinity , and their kb_theory_of_forms were preserved in the kb_marble or stone kb_chemical_element of the kb_egyptian_temple of kb_doric_order . the kb_greeks used standard types because they believed that the kb_world of kb_object_relations_theory was kb_a series of typical kb_theory_of_forms which could kb_beryllium represented in several instances . the kb_egyptian_temple should kb_beryllium canonic , and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection . from the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century times there were certain kb_biological_rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle kb_buildings . the kb_first_trimester kb_buildings were built narrowly in kb_order_(biology) to hold the roof , and when the kb_dimensional_analysis changed some mathematical kb_foreign_relations_of_albania became necessary in kb_order_(biology) to keep the original kb_theory_of_forms . this probably influenced the kb_theory of kb_grammatical_number of kb_pythagoras , kb_world_health_organization believed that behind the kb_appearance_(philosophy) of things there was the permanent kb_principle_(chemistry) of kb_mathematics .the kb_doric_order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century bc but there was kb_a mathematical problem regarding the kb_positional_notation of the triglyphs , which could n't kb_beryllium solved without changing the original kb_theory_of_forms . the kb_order_(biology) was almost abandoned for the kb_ionic_order , but the kb_ionic_crystal kb_list_of_australian_capital_cities also posed an kb_insoluble problem at the corner of kb_a kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina . both kb_order_(biology) were abandoned for the kb_corinthian_order kb_order_(biology)when kb_zeus ' wife kb_hera discovered that kb_leto was impregnanted by kb_zeus , she banned kb_leto from giving birth on `` kb_solid_earth '' . in her wanderings , kb_leto sought shelter on many lands , only to kb_beryllium rejected by them . finally , she saw kb_delos , kb_a floating kb_island , which was neither kb_a real kb_island nor kb_a mainland . kb_it is said that kb_apollo_program , still in kb_leto 's kb_womb , had informed kb_histidine mother about kb_delos to put an end to her suffering . kb_leto , when welcomed by kb_delos , gave birth there , clinging to kb_a kb_palm_tree .kb_it is also stated that kb_hera kidnapped kb_eileithyiawhen kb_apollo_program was born clutching kb_a kb_golden_eagle kb_sword , the swans circled kb_delos seven times and the kb_nymphs sang in delight . soon after kb_he_(letter) was born , kb_he_(letter) was washed clean by the goddesses and was covered in kb_white_american garment , with kb_golden_eagle bands fastened around him . since kb_leto was unable to kb_animal_feed the kb_new_world born , kb_themis , the kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of kb_divinity kb_law , fed him the kb_nectar_(plant) , or kb_ragweed . upon tasting the kb_divinity kb_food_industry , kb_apollo_program broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that kb_he_(letter) would kb_beryllium the kb_master's_degree of kb_lyrekb_leto was kb_acceptance#self_acceptance by the kb_people_(american_magazine) of kb_delos and she promised them that her son would kb_beryllium always favorable towards kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey . afterwards , kb_zeus secured kb_delos to the bottom of the kb_oceanus . this kb_island later became kb_sacred_architecture to kb_apollo_program .kb_apollo_program was born on the seventh day ( , `` hebdomagenes '' ) of the month kb_thargelion —according to delian tradition—or of the month bysios—according to delphian kb_tradition . the seventh and twentieth , the days of the kb_new_world and kb_full_moon kb_moon , were ever afterwards held kb_sacred_architecture to him . mythographers agree that kb_artemis was born kb_first_trimester and subsequently assisted with the birth of kb_apollo_program , or that kb_artemis was born on the kb_island of kb_ortygia and that she helped kb_leto cross the kb_sea_(astronomy) to kb_delos the kb_next day to give birth to kb_apollo_program .as kb_a child , kb_apollo_program is said to have built kb_a kb_foundation_(engineering) and an altar on kb_delos using the horns of the goats that kb_histidine sister kb_artemis hunted . since kb_he_(letter) learnt the kb_art of building when kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , kb_he_(letter) later became ``

kb_zeus did n't agree and instead exiled kb_histidine son from kb_mount_olympus , and instructed him to get purified . kb_apollo_program had to serve as kb_a slave for nine years . after the servitude was over , as per kb_histidine kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) 's kb_order_(biology) kb_apollo_program travelled to the kb_vale_of_tempe of tempe to kb_bath,_somerset in waters of kb_pineios_(thessaly) . there kb_zeus himself performed purification rites on kb_apollo_program . purified , kb_apollo_program was escorted by kb_histidine half sister kb_athena to kb_delphi where the kb_oracular shrine was finally handed over to him by kb_gaea . according to kb_a variation , kb_apollo_program had also travelled to kb_crete , where kb_carmanor_(deity) had to perform purification rites on him .

the same extent as kb_zeus by mortals . due to this kb_zeus wished to destroy him . but kb_apollo_program requested kb_histidine kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) not to kb_women's_suffrage kb_sulfate ,

, everyone became frenzied with joy . this kb_light-emitting_diode kb_marsyas to think that kb_he_(letter) was better than kb_apollo_program , and kb_he_(letter) challenged the kb_god to kb_a musical contest . the contest was judged by the kb_musesafter they each performed , both were deemed equal until kb_apollo_program decreed they play and sing at the same kb_time_(magazine) . kb_marsyas argued against this , saying that kb_apollo_program would have an advantage . but kb_apollo_program presented the kb_counterpoint that since kb_marsyas played the kb_flute , which needed

wives of the kb_dioscuri ) , kb_athena_parthenos ( turned into kb_a kb_constellation upon her kb_death ) and by some accounts , kb_scylla .additionally , kb_apollo_program fostered and educated kb_2060_chiron , the kb_centaur_(minor_planet) kb_world_health_organization later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods , including kb_apollo_program 's sons . kb_apollo_program also fostered kb_carnus , the son of kb_zeus and kb_europa_(mythology) .kb_marpessa was kidnapped by kb_idas but was loved by kb_apollo_program as kb_water_well . kb_zeus made her choose between them , and she chose kb_idas on the grounds that kb_apollo_program , kb_being kb_immortality , would tire of her when she grew kb_old_testament .kb_sinope_(mythology) , kb_a kb_nymph , was approached by the amorous kb_apollo_program . she made him promise that kb_he_(letter) would kb_ulysses_s._grant to her whatever she would kb_amplitude-shift_keying for , and then cleverly asked him to let her stay kb_a virgin . kb_apollo_program kept kb_histidine promise and went back .kb_bolina was admired by kb_apollo_program but she refused him and jumped into the kb_sea_(astronomy) . to avoid her kb_death , kb_apollo_program turned her into kb_a kb_nymph and let her kb_go_(game) .kb_castalia was kb_a kb_nymph whom kb_apollo_program loved . she fled from him and kb_dove into the kb_castalian_spring at kb_delphi , at the kb_base_(chemistry) of mt . parnassos , which was then kb_english_alphabet#letter_names after her . kb_water from this kb_castalian_spring was kb_sacred_architecture ; kb_it was used to clean the delphian kb_egyptian_temple and inspire the priestesses .kb_cassandra , was kb_a kb_decay_product of kb_hecuba and kb_priam . kb_apollo_program wished to kb_court her . kb_cassandra promised to return kb_histidine kb_love on kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) condition - kb_he_(letter) should give her the kb_power_(physics) to kb_episcopal_see the future . kb_apollo_program fulfilled her wish , but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after . angered that she broke her promise , kb_apollo_program cursed her that even though she would kb_episcopal_see the future , no kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) would ever kb_believe_(tv_series) her prophecies .kb_hestiakb_artemis as the sister of kb_apollo_program , is `` thea apollousa '' , that is , she as kb_a female kb_divinity represented the same idea that kb_apollo_program did as kb_a kb_male kb_divinity . in the pre-hellenic period , their relationship was described as the kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) between husband and wife , and there seems to have been kb_a kb_tradition which actually described kb_artemis as the wife of kb_apollo_program . however , this relationship was never sexual but kb_spirituality , which is why they both are seen kb_being unmarried in the kb_hellenic_periodkb_artemis , like her brother , is kb_weapon with kb_a kb_bow_river and arrows . she is the cause of sudden kb_maternal_death of women . she also is the protector of the kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , especially girls . though she has nothing to do with kb_oracle_machine , kb_music or kb_poetry , she sometimes kb_light-emitting_diode the female kb_greek_chorus on kb_mount_olympus while kb_apollo_program sang . the kb_bay_laurel was kb_sacred_architecture to both . `` kb_artemis daphnaia '' had her kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina among the lacedemonians , at kb_a kb_place_of_articulation called hypsoi . in later times when kb_apollo_program was regarded as kb_identical_particles with the kb_sun or kb_helios , kb_artemis was naturally regarded as selene or the kb_moon .the kb_bay_laurel was kb_sacred_architecture to both . `` kb_apollo_program daphnephoros '' had kb_a kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina in kb_eretria , kb_a `` kb_place_of_articulation where the citizens are to kb_take the oaths .kb_hecate , the kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of kb_witchcraft and kb_magic_(supernatural) , is the kb_chthonic counterpart of kb_apollo_program . they both are cousins , since their mothers - kb_leto and kb_asteria_(titaness)the oldest kb_evidence_(law) found for kb_hecate 's kb_achilles#worship is at kb_apollo_program 's kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina in kb_miletos . there , kb_hecate was taken to kb_beryllium kb_apollo_program 's sister counterpart in the absence of kb_artemis . kb_hecate 's kb_moon kb_nature makes her the kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of the waning kb_moon and contrats and complements , at the same kb_time_(magazine) , kb_apollo_program 's solar kb_nature .as kb_a kb_deity of kb_knowledge_representation and kb_great_power kb_power_(physics) , kb_apollo_program was seen kb_being the kb_male counterpart of kb_athena . kb_being kb_zeus ' favorite children , they were given more powers and duties . kb_apollo_program and kb_athena often took up the role as protectors of cities , and were patrons of some of the important cities . kb_athena was the kb_principle_(chemistry) kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of kb_athens , kb_apollo_program was the kb_principle_(chemistry) kb_god of kb_spartaas patrons of kb_arts , kb_apollo_program and kb_athena were companions of the kb_muses , the former kb_a much more frequent companion than the latter . kb_apollo_program was sometimes called the son of kb_athena and kb_hephaestus due to kb_histidine wise and artistic kb_nature .in the kb_trojan_war , as kb_zeus ' kb_executive_(government) , kb_apollo_program is seen holding the kb_aegis like kb_athena usually does . kb_apollo_program 's decisions were usually approved by kb_histidine sister kb_athena , and they both worked to establish kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law and kb_order_(biology) kb_set_(mythology) forth by kb_zeus .in kb_aeschylus ' `` kb_oresteia '' trilogy , kb_clytemnestra kills her husband , kb_king kb_agamemnon because kb_he_(letter) had sacrificed their kb_decay_product kb_iphigenia to proceed forward with the kb_trojan_war . kb_apollo_program gives an kb_order_(biology) through the kb_oracle at kb_delphi that kb_agamemnon 's son , kb_orestes , is to kill kb_clytemnestra and kb_aegisthus , her lover . kb_orestes and pylades carry out the revenge , and consequently kb_orestes is pursued by the kb_erinyes or furies ( female kb_anthropomorphism of kb_revenge ) .kb_apollo_program and the furies argue about whether the kb_matricide was justified ; kb_apollo_program holds that the kb_chemical_bond of kb_marriage is kb_sacred_architecture and kb_orestes was avenging kb_histidine kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , whereas the kb_erinyes say that the kb_chemical_bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the kb_chemical_bond of kb_marriage . they invade kb_histidine kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina , and kb_he_(letter) drives them away . kb_he_(letter) says that the kb_matter should kb_beryllium brought before kb_athena . kb_apollo_program promises to protect kb_orestes , as kb_orestes has become kb_apollo_program 's kb_supplication . kb_apollo_program advocates kb_orestes at kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial , and ultimately kb_athena kb_biological_rules in favor of kb_apollo_program .the kb_roman_empire kb_achilles#worship of kb_apollo_program was kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome from the kb_greeks . as kb_a quintessentially kb_list_of_greek_mythological_figures , kb_apollo_program had no direct kb_roman_empire kb_cognate , although later kb_roman_empire poets often referred to him as phoebus . there was kb_a kb_tradition that the kb_pythia kb_oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kb_roman_kingdom kb_roman_empire during the reign of kb_tarquinius_superbus superbus .on the occasion of kb_a pestilence in the 430s bce , kb_apollo_program 's kb_temple_of_apollo_sosianus at kb_roman_empire was established in the flaminian fields , replacing an older kb_cult_(religious_practice) site there known as the `` apollinare '' . during the kb_second_punic_war kb_war in 212 bce , the `` kb_ludi_apollinares apollinares '' ( `` apollonian games '' ) were instituted in kb_histidine honor , on the instructions of kb_a kb_prophecy attributed to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) marcius . in the kb_time_(magazine) of kb_augustus , kb_world_health_organization considered himself under the special protection of

kb_deity of kb_roman_empire .after the kb_battle_of_actium kb_actium , which was fought near kb_a sanctuary of kb_apollo_program , kb_augustus enlarged kb_apollo_program 's kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina , dedicated kb_a portion of the spoils to him , and instituted kb_quinquennial games in kb_histidine kb_honour . kb_he_(letter) also erected kb_temple_of_apollo_(palatine) kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina to the kb_god on the kb_palatine_hill kb_hill . sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to kb_apollo_program and kb_diana_(mythology) formed the culmination of the kb_secular_games , held in 17 bce to celebrate the dawn of kb_a kb_new_world era .the kb_tribal_chief apollonian festival was the kb_pythian_games games held every four years at kb_delphi and was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the four great kb_panhellenic_games games . also of kb_major_(united_states) importance was the kb_delia_(festival) held every four years on kb_delos .kb_athenian kb_annual_plant festivals included the kb_boedromia , kb_metageitnia , kb_pyanepsia , and kb_thargelia .spartan kb_annual_plant festivals were the kb_carneia and the kb_hyacinthia .kb_thebes_(greece) every nine years held the kb_daphnephoria .kb_apollo_program 's most common kb_attribute_(role-playing_games) were the kb_bow_river and kb_arrow_(weapon) . kb_other_(philosophy) kb_attribute_(role-playing_games) of kb_histidine included the kb_kithara ( an advanced version of the common kb_lyre ) , the kb_plectrum and the kb_sword . another common emblem was the kb_sacrificial_tripod tripod , representing kb_histidine prophetic powers . the kb_pythian_games games were held in kb_apollo_program 's honor every four years at kb_delphi . the kb_bay_laurel kb_bay_laurel kb_plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the kb_laurel_wreath of victorythe kb_palm_tree was also kb_sacred_architecture to kb_apollo_program because kb_he_(letter) had been born under kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) in kb_delos . kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing kb_sacred_architecture to kb_apollo_program included kb_gray_wolf , dolphins , kb_roe_deer kb_deer , swans , cicadas ( symbolizing kb_music and song ) , hawks , ravens , crows , kb_snakes ( referencing kb_apollo_program 's kb_function_(biology) as the kb_god of kb_prophecy ) , mice and griffinsas kb_god of colonization , kb_apollo_program gave kb_oracular guidance on kb_abraham_lincoln_on_slavery#colonization , especially during the height of colonization , 750–550 bce . according to kb_ancient_greek_astronomy , kb_he_(letter) helped kb_crete or arcadian kb_colonies_in_antiquity found kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_troy . however , this story may reflect kb_a kb_cultural_anthropology influence which had the kb_obverse_and_reverse direction : kb_hittites kb_cuneiform kb_literature mention kb_a minor kb_asian_people kb_god called `` appaliunas '' or `` apalunas '' in connection with kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_wilusa attested in kb_hittites kb_inscriptiones_graecae , which is now generally regarded as kb_being kb_identical_particles with the kb_ancient_greek kb_troy by most scholars . in this kb_interpretation_(logic) , kb_apollo_program 's kb_title of `` lykegenes '' can simply kb_beryllium kb_walter_read as `` born in kb_lycia '' , which effectively severs the kb_god 's supposed link with kb_gray_wolf ( possibly kb_a kb_folk_etymology ) .in literary contexts , kb_apollo_program represents kb_harmony , kb_order_(biology) , and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of kb_dionysus , kb_god of kb_wine , kb_world_health_organization represents ecstasy and disorder . the kb_contrast_(vision) between the roles of these kb_deity is reflected in the adjectives kb_apollonian_and_dionysian and dionysian . however , the kb_greeks thought of the kb_2_(number) qualities as complementary : the kb_2_(number) kb_deity are kb_monk , and when kb_apollo_program at kb_winter kb_left-wing_politics for kb_hyperborea , kb_he_(letter) would leave the kb_pythia kb_oracle to kb_dionysus . this kb_contrast_(vision) appears to kb_beryllium shown on the kb_2_(number) sides of the kb_borghese_vase vase .kb_apollo_program is often associated with the kb_golden_mean_(philosophy) . this is the kb_ancient_greek kb_ideal_(ring_theory) of kb_moderation and kb_a kb_virtue that opposes kb_gluttonykb_apollo_program is kb_a common kb_theme_(byzantine_district) in kb_ancient_greek and kb_roman_empire kb_art and also in the kb_art of the kb_renaissance . the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century kb_ancient_greek word for kb_a kb_statue is `` delight '' ( , `` agalma '' ) , and the sculptors tried to create kb_theory_of_forms which would inspire such guiding kb_computer_vision . kb_ancient_greek kb_art puts into kb_apollo_program the highest kb_degree_(angle) of kb_power_(physics) and kb_beauty that can kb_beryllium imagined . the sculptors kb_derived_trait this from kb_observations_(pierre_belon) on kb_human_kind , but they also kb_embodied_agent in kb_concrete kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , issues beyond the reach of kb_ordinary_(officer) thought .the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the kb_cult_(religious_practice) of the kb_human_body that was essentially kb_a kb_religion activity . the muscular frames and kb_limb_(anatomy) combined with slim waists indicate the kb_ancient_greek desire for health , and the kb_health capacity which was necessary in the hard kb_ancient_greek environment . the statues of kb_apollo_program embody kb_beauty , kb_formal_balance and inspire awe before the kb_beauty of the kb_world .the kb_evolution of the kb_ancient_greek kb_sculpture can kb_beryllium observed in kb_histidine depictions from the almost static formal kb_kouros kb_type_(biology) in kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period , to the kb_representation_(arts) of kb_motion_(physics) in kb_a relative harmonious whole in kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period . in kb_classical_greece the kb_emphasis_(typography) is not given to the illusive kb_imagination kb_reality represented by the kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_theory_of_forms , but to the analogies and the kb_interaction of the members in the whole , kb_a method created by kb_polykleitos . finally kb_praxiteles seems to kb_beryllium released from any kb_art and kb_religion conformities , and kb_histidine masterpieces are kb_a kb_mixture of kb_realism_(arts) with stylization .the kb_evolution of the kb_ancient_greek kb_art seems to kb_go_(game) parallel with the kb_ancient_greek kb_philosophy conceptions , which changed from the natural-philosophy of kb_thales to the kb_metaphysics kb_theory of kb_pythagoras . kb_thales searched for kb_a kb_simple_polygon material-form directly perceptible by the senses , behind the appearances of things , and kb_histidine kb_theory is also related to the older kb_animism . this was paralleled in kb_sculpture by the kb_absolute_morality kb_representation_(arts) of vigorous kb_life_(magazine) , through unnaturally simplified kb_theory_of_forms .kb_pythagoras believed that behind the kb_appearance_(philosophy) of things , there was the permanent kb_principle_(chemistry) of kb_mathematics , and that the kb_theory_of_forms were based on kb_a kb_transcendental_number mathematical relation . the kb_theory_of_forms on kb_earth , are imperfect imitations ( , `` eikones '' , `` images '' ) of the celestial kb_world of kb_grammatical_number . kb_histidine kb_idea had kb_a great influence on post-archaic kb_art . the kb_ancient_greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation , that would kb_lead to the esthetic perfection . ( kb_aesthetic_canon ) .in kb_classical_greece , kb_anaxagoras asserted that kb_a kb_divinity kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving ( kb_mind ) gave kb_order_(biology) to the seeds of the kb_universe , and kb_platokb_kouros ( `` kb_male youth '' ) is the kb_modern_history kb_terminology given to those representations of standing kb_male youths which kb_first_trimester appear in the kb_archaic_period_in_greece in kb_greece . this kb_type_(biology) served certain kb_religion needs and was kb_first_trimester kb_anatolian_hypothesis for what was previously thought to kb_beryllium depictions of `` kb_apollo_program '' . the kb_first_trimester statues are certainly still and formal . the formality of their stance seems to kb_beryllium related with the kb_egyptian_language kb_stare_decisis , but kb_it was kb_acceptance#self_acceptance for kb_a good kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving . the sculptors had kb_a clear idea of what kb_a kb_thomas_young_(scientist) man is , and kb_embodied_agent the archaic smile of good manners , the firm and springy step , the kb_formal_balance of the kb_human_body , dignity , and youthful kb_happiness . when they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men , kb_it was because men had common kb_semitic_root with the unchanging kb_deity . the adoption of kb_a standard recognizable kb_type_(biology) for kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_time_(magazine) , is probably because kb_nature gives preference in survival of kb_a kb_type_(biology) which has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_beryllium kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by the kb_climatic conditions , and also due to the kb_general_(united_states) kb_ancient_greek belief that kb_nature expresses itself in `` kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_theory_of_forms '' that can kb_beryllium imagined and represented . these kb_theory_of_forms expressed immortality . kb_apollo_program was the kb_immortality kb_god of `` kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_formal_balance and kb_order_(biology) '' . kb_histidine shrine in kb_delphiin the kb_first_trimester large-scale depictions during the kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period ( 640–580 bc ) , the artists tried to draw kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's attention to kb_look_(american_magazine) into the interior of the face and the kb_human_body which were not represented as lifeless masses , but as kb_being full of kb_life_(magazine) . the kb_greeks maintained , until late in their kb_civilization_(series) , an almost kb_animism idea that the statues are in some kb_word_sense alive . this embodies the belief that the image was somehow the kb_god or man himself . kb_a kb_fine_(penalty) example is the kb_statue of the `` kb_sacred_gate kb_kouros '' which was found at the cemetery of kb_dipylon in kb_athens ( kb_dipylon_kouros ) . the kb_statue is the `` kb_object_(philosophy) kb_thing-in-itself itself '' , and kb_histidine slender face with the deep eyes express an kb_intellectual kb_eternity . according to the kb_ancient_greek_astronomy the kb_dipylon was kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_daedalusthe kb_animism idea as the kb_representation_(arts) of the kb_imagination kb_reality , is sanctified in the kb_homeric poems and in kb_ancient_greek kb_egyptian_mythology , in stories of the kb_god kb_hephaestus ( kb_phaistos ) and the mythic kb_daedalus ( the builder of the kb_labyrinth ) that made images which moved of their own accord . this kind of kb_art goes back to the kb_minoan_civilization period , when its main kb_theme_(byzantine_district) was the kb_representation_(arts) of kb_motion_(physics) in kb_a specific moment . these free-standing statues were usually kb_marble , but also the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism rendered in kb_limestone , kb_bronze_age , kb_ivory and kb_terracotta .the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century examples of life-sized statues of kb_apollo_program , may kb_beryllium kb_2_(number) figures from the kb_ionic_crystal sanctuary on the kb_island of kb_delos . such statues were found across the kb_ancient_greek speaking kb_world , the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of kb_apollo_program with more than kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hundred from the sanctuary of `` kb_apollo_program ptoios '' , kb_boeotia alone . the last stage in the development of the `` kb_kouros kb_type_(biology) '' is the kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period ( 520–485 bc ) , in which the kb_ancient_greek kb_sculpture attained kb_a full kb_knowledge_representation of kb_human_body and used to create kb_a relative harmonious whole . ranking from the very few bronzes survived to kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) is the masterpiece kb_bronze_age kb_piraeus_apollo . kb_it was found in kb_piraeus , the kb_harbour of kb_athens . the kb_statue originally held the kb_bow_river in its kb_left-wing_politics kb_hand , and kb_a cup of pouring libation in its kb_right-wing_politics kb_hand . kb_it probably comes from north-eastern kb_peloponnesus . the kb_emphasis_(typography) is given in kb_comparative_anatomy , and kb_it is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester attempts to represent kb_a kind of kb_motion_(physics) , and kb_beauty relative to proportions , which appear mostly in post-archaic kb_art . the kb_statue kb_throw_(grappling) some kb_light on an artistic centre which , with an independently kb_adaptation harder , simpler and heavier kb_carpel , restricts kb_ionian_greeks influence in kb_athens . finally , this is the germ from which the kb_art of kb_polykleitosat kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the kb_classical_greece , kb_it was considered that kb_beauty in visible things as in everything else , consisted of kb_symmetry and proportions . the artists tried also to represent kb_motion_(physics) in kb_a specific moment ( kb_myron ) , which may kb_beryllium considered as the reappearance of the dormant kb_minoan_civilization kb_chemical_element . kb_comparative_anatomy and kb_geometry are fused in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) , and each does something to the kb_other_(philosophy) . the kb_ancient_greek sculptors tried to clarify kb_it by looking for mathematical proportions , just as they sought some kb_reality behind appearances . kb_polykleitos in kb_histidine `` kb_aesthetic_canon '' wrote that kb_beauty consists in the kb_hierarchical_proportion not of the kb_chemical_element ( materials ) , but of the parts , that is the interrelation of parts with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) another and with the whole . kb_it seems that kb_he_(letter) was influenced by the kb_theories of kb_pythagoras .the famous `` kb_apollo_program of kb_mantua '' and its variants are early kb_theory_of_forms of the kb_apollo_citharoedus kb_statue kb_type_(biology) , in which the kb_god holds the kb_cithara in kb_histidine kb_left-wing_politics kb_arm . the kb_type_(biology) is represented by kb_neo-attic kb_ottoman_empire kb_roman_empire copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century , modelled upon kb_a supposed kb_ancient_greek kb_bronze_age original made in the kb_second quarter of the 5th century bce , in kb_a kb_carpel similar to works of kb_polykleitos but more archaic . the kb_apollo_program held the `` cythara '' against kb_histidine extended kb_left-wing_politics kb_arm , of which in the louvre example , kb_a fragment of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) twisting scrolling kb_french_horn upright remains against kb_histidine biceps .though the proportions were always important in kb_ancient_greek kb_art , the kb_appeal of the kb_ancient_greek sculptures eludes any explanation by kb_hierarchical_proportion alone . the statues of kb_apollo_program were thought to kb_incarnation kb_histidine living presence , and these representations of illusive kb_imagination kb_reality had deep kb_semitic_root in the kb_minoan_civilization period , and in the kb_orthodoxy of the kb_first_trimester kb_ancient_greekin the archaic pediments and friezes of the kb_egyptian_temple , the artists had kb_a problem to fit kb_a kb_group_(periodic_table) of figures into an isosceles kb_triangle_(musical_instrument) with acute angles at the kb_base_(chemistry) .the kb_siphnian_treasury treasury in kb_delphi was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester kb_ancient_greek kb_buildings utilizing the kb_solid_solution to put the dominating kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism in the middle , and to complete the descending scale of height with kb_other_(philosophy) figures sitting or kneeling . the pediment shows the story of kb_heracles stealing kb_apollo_program 's tripod that was strongly associated with kb_histidine kb_oracular inspiration . their kb_2_(number) figures hold the centre . in the pediment of the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina of kb_zeus in kb_olympia_(manet)these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the kb_human_eye for their own visible sake . they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in kb_space , but only as parts in kb_a larger whole . while each scene has its own kb_character_(computing) and completeness kb_it must fit into the kb_general_(united_states) sequence to which kb_it belongs . in these archaic pediments the sculptors use kb_empty_string intervals , to suggest kb_a passage to and from kb_a busy battlefield . the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical kb_pattern and kb_order_(biology) , and this was improved when kb_classical_conditioning kb_art brought kb_a greater kb_freedom and kb_economy_of_alaska .kb_apollo_program as kb_a handsome beardless kb_thomas_young_(scientist) man , is often depicted with kb_a kb_kithara ( as kb_apollo_citharoedus ) or kb_bow_river in kb_histidine kb_hand , or reclining on kb_a kb_tree ( the kb_apollo_lykeios and kb_apollo_sauroctonos types ) . the kb_apollo_belvedere is kb_a kb_marble kb_sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century ; for kb_century_(cricket) kb_it epitomized the ideals of kb_classical_antiquity for europeans , from the kb_renaissance through the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century . the kb_marble is kb_a kb_hellenistic_period or kb_roman_empire copy of kb_a kb_bronze_age original by the kb_ancient_greek kb_sculptor_(constellation) kb_leochares , made between 350 and 325 bce .the life-size so-called `` kb_adonis '' found in 1780 on the site of kb_a `` kb_roman_villa '' near the via labicana in the kb_roman_empire suburb of centocelle is kb_interpretatio_graeca as an kb_apollo_program by kb_modern_history scholars . in the late 2nd century kb_council_of_europe floor kb_mosaic from kb_el_djem , kb_roman_empire `` thysdrus '' , kb_he_(letter) is identifiable as kb_helios by kb_histidine effulgent kb_halo_(religious_iconography) , though now even kb_a kb_god 's kb_divinity kb_nudity is concealed by kb_histidine cloak , kb_a kb_mark_waugh of increasing conventions of modesty in the later kb_roman_empire .another haloed kb_apollo_program in kb_mosaic , from kb_hadrumentum , is in the kb_museum at kb_sousse . the conventions of this kb_representation_(arts) , kb_human_head tilted , lips slightly parted , large-eyed , curling kb_hairstyle cut in locks kb_grazing the kb_neck , were kb_adaptation in the 3rd century bce to depict kb_alexander_the_great great . some kb_time_(magazine) after this kb_mosaic was kb_execution_(computing) , the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century depictions of kb_jesus_christ would also kb_beryllium beardless and haloed .kb_apollo_program has often featured in postclassical kb_art and kb_ancient_egyptian_literature . kb_percy_bysshe_shelley bysshe shelley composed kb_a `` hymn of kb_apollo_program '' ( 1820 ) , and the kb_god 's instruction of the kb_muses formed the kb_grammatical_subject of kb_igor_stravinsky stravinsky 's `` kb_apollon_musagète '' ( 1927–1928 ) . in 1978 , the kb_canadians band kb_rush_(band) released kb_hemispheres_(rush_album) kb_purple_rain_(album) with songs `` kb_apollo_program : bringer of wisdom '' / '' kb_dionysus : bringer of kb_love '' .in discussion of kb_the_arts kb_arts , kb_a distinction is sometimes made between the kb_apollonian_and_dionysian and dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing kb_intellectual kb_order_(biology) and the latter with chaotic creativity . kb_friedrich_nietzsche nietzsche argued that kb_a fusion of the kb_2_(number) was most desirable . kb_carl_jung jung 's kb_apollo_archetype represents what kb_he_(letter) saw as the disposition in kb_people_(american_magazine) to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional kb_distance .kb_charles_handy handy , in `` kb_deity of kb_management '' ( 1978 ) uses kb_ancient_greek kb_deity as kb_a metaphor to portray various types of kb_organizational_culture kb_albanian_culture . kb_apollo_program represents kb_a 'role ' kb_albanian_culture where kb_order_(biology) ,

, and kb_cambodia come together ) , and that the kb_family_(biology) is not as kb_old_testament as frequently assumed , dating to perhaps 2000 bce . peiros ( 2011 ) criticized sidwell 's kb_theory heavily and calls kb_it kb_a bunch of contradictions . kb_he_(letter) show with kb_histidine kb_analysis that the kb_urheimat of austroasiatic is somewhere near the kb_yangtze . kb_he_(letter) suggests the kb_sichuan_basin as likely kb_urheimat of proto-austroasiatic before they migrated to kb_other_(philosophy) parts of kb_central_europe and kb_south_china and than into kb_southeast_asia . kb_he_(letter) further suggests that the kb_family_(biology) must kb_beryllium as kb_old_testament as proto-austronesian and proto-sinotibetan or even older .georg van driem ( 2011 ) proposes that the kb_urheimat of austroasiatic is somewhere in kb_south_china . kb_he_(letter) suggests that the kb_region around the kb_pearl_river_(china) kb_river ( kb_china ) is the likely kb_urheimat of the kb_austroasiatic_languages languages and kb_people_(american_magazine) . kb_he_(letter) further suggests , based on kb_heredity studies , that the migration of kb_kra–dai_languages

kb_other_(philosophy) geneticists criticise the kb_zhivotovsky_method method .kb_roger_blench kb_roger_blench ( kb_2009_in_science ) also proposes that there might have been kb_other_(philosophy) kb_primary_education kb_branches_of_science of austroasiatic that are now kb_extinct , based on kb_substratum kb_evidence_(law) in modern-day languages .kb_other_(philosophy) languages with

kb_indo-gangetic_plain plain , and were then absorbed by kb_indo-aryan_languages at an early date as kb_indo-aryan_languages kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) kb_east_africa . peterson notes that kb_eastern_hemisphere kb_indo-aryan_languageskb_paul_sidwell ( kb_2009_in_science ) , in kb_a kb_lexicostatistical comparison of 36 languages which are kb_water_well known enough to exclude loan kb_lexical_semantics , finds little kb_evidence_(law) for internal branching , though kb_he_(letter) did find an kb_area of increased contact between the kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages , such that languages of all kb_branches_of_science apart from the kb_geography_of_albania distant kb_munda_languages and kb_nicobarese_languages show greater similarity to kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages the closer they are to those kb_branches_of_science , without any noticeable innovations common to kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages .kb_he_(letter) therefore takes the kb_conservative view that the thirteen kb_branches_of_science of austroasiatic should kb_beryllium treated as equidistant on kb_electric_current kb_evidence_(law) . sidwell & kb_roger_blench ( 2011 ) discuss this proposal in more detail , and note that there is good kb_evidence_(law) for kb_a khasi–palaungic kb_cladistics , which could also possibly kb_beryllium closely related to khmuic .if this would the case , sidwell & kb_roger_blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) westward . sidwell & kb_roger_blench ( 2011 ) suggest kb_shompen_language as an additional branch , and kb_believe_(tv_series) that kb_a vieto-katuic connection is worth investigating . in kb_general_(united_states) , however , the kb_family_(biology) is thought to have diversified too quickly for kb_a deeply nested kb_structure to have kb_adaptation , since proto-austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the kb_central_europe kb_mekong_river kb_valley relatively quickly .subsequently , sidwell ( 2015a : 179 ) kb_anatolian_hypothesis that kb_nicobarese_languages subgroups with kb_aslian_languages , just as how khasian and palaungic subgroup with each kb_other_(philosophy) . kb_a subsequent computational kb_phylogenetics kb_analysis of the austroasiatic kb_language_family by sidwell ( 2015b ) suggests that austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science may have kb_a loosely nested kb_structure rather than kb_a completely rake-like kb_structure , with an east-west kb_division_(mathematics) ( consisting of kb_munda_languages , khasic , palaungic , and khmuic forming kb_a kb_western_esotericism kb_group_(periodic_table) as opposed to all of the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_branches_of_science ) occurring possibly as early as 7,000 years before present .integrating computational kb_phylogenetics kb_linguistics with recent kb_archaeology findings , kb_paul_sidwell ( 2015c ) further expanded kb_histidine kb_mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into kb_indochina from the kb_lingnan kb_area of kb_south_china , with the subsequent kb_mekong riverine dispersal taking kb_place_of_articulation after the initial kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_neolithic farmers from kb_south_china .sidwell ( 2015c ) tentatively suggests that austroasiatic may have begun to split up 5,000 years b.p . during the kb_neolithic_transition era of kb_mainland_southeast_asia kb_southeast_asia , with all the kb_major_(united_states) kb_branches_of_science of austroasiatic formed by 4,000 b.p . austroasiatic would have had kb_2_(number) possible dispersal routes from the kb_western_esotericism kb_peripheral_nervous_system of the kb_pearl_river_(china) kb_river kb_drainage_divide of kb_lingnan , which would have been either kb_a kb_coastal route down the kb_coast of kb_vietnam , or downstream through the kb_mekong_river via kb_yunnan . both the reconstructed kb_lexicon of proto-austroasiatic and the kb_archaeology record clearly show that early austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers around 4,000 b.p . cultivated kb_rice and kb_millet , kept kb_livestock such as dogs , pigs , and kb_chickens , and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than kb_coastal environments .at 4,500 b.p. , this `` kb_neolithic package '' suddenly arrived in kb_indochina from the kb_lingnan kb_area without kb_cereal kb_cereal and displaced the kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet pre-neolithic kb_hunter-gatherer cultures , with kb_cereal husks found in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_indochina by 4,100 b.p . and in kb_southern_europe kb_indochina by 3,800 b.p . however , sidwell ( 2015c ) found that kb_iron is not reconstructable in proto-austroasiatic , since each austroasiatic branch has different terms for kb_iron that had been kb_loanword relatively lately from tai , kb_chinese_characters , tibetan , kb_malay_language , and kb_other_(philosophy) languages .during the kb_iron_age about 2,500 b.p. , relatively kb_thomas_young_(scientist) austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science in kb_indochina such as kb_vietic_languages , kb_katuic_languages , kb_pearic_languages , and kb_khmer_alphabet were formed , while the more internally diverse kb_bahnaric_languages branch ( dating to about 3,000 b.p . ) underwent more extensive internal diversification . by the kb_iron_age , all of the austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science were more or less in their present-day locations , with most of the diversification within austroasiatic taking kb_place_of_articulation during the kb_iron_age .kb_paul_sidwell ( 2018 ) considers the austroasiatic kb_language_family to have rapidly diversified around 4,000 years b.p . during the kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_rice kb_agriculture in kb_indochina , but notes that the kb_evolution of proto-austroasiatic itself is older than that date . the kb_lexicon of proto-austroasiatic can kb_beryllium divided into an early and late stratum . the early stratum consists of kb_base_(chemistry) kb_lexicon including kb_human_body parts , kb_animal names , kb_natural_number features , and pronouns , while the names of kb_cultural_anthropology items ( kb_agriculture terms and kb_lexical_semantics for kb_cultural_anthropology kb_artifact_(archaeology) , which are reconstructable in proto-austroasiatic ) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism part of the later stratum .kb_roger_blench kb_roger_blench ( 2017 ) suggests that vocabulary related to kb_aquatic_plant subsistence strategies ( such as boats , waterways , kb_river kb_fauna , and kb_fish capture techniques ) , can kb_beryllium reconstructed for proto-austroasiatic . kb_roger_blench ( 2017 ) finds widespread austroasiatic kb_semitic_root for 'river , kb_valley ' , 'boat ' , 'fish ' , 'catfish sp . ' , 'eel ' , 'prawn ' , 'shrimp ' ( kb_central_europe austroasiatic ) , 'crab ' , 'tortoise ' , 'turtle ' , 'otter ' , 'crocodile ' , 'heron , kb_fishing kb_bird ' , and 'fish trap ' . kb_archaeology kb_evidence_(law) for the presence of kb_agriculture in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_indochina ( kb_northern_hemisphere kb_vietnam , kb_laos , and kb_other_(philosophy) nearby areas ) dates back to only about 4,000 years b.p . ( 2,000 b.c . ) , with kb_agriculture ultimately kb_being introduced from further up to the kb_north in the kb_yangtze kb_valley where kb_it has been dated to 6,000 b.p .hence , this points to kb_a relatively late riverine dispersal of austroasiatic as compared to kb_sino-tibetan_languages , whose kb_appledesign_powered_speakers had kb_a distinct non-riverine kb_albanian_culture . in kb_addition to living an aquatic-based kb_lifestyle_(sociology) , early austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers would have also had access to kb_livestock , crops , and newer types of watercraft . as early austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways , they would have encountered kb_appledesign_powered_speakers of older kb_language_family kb_world_health_organization were already kb_second_greek_colonisation in the kb_area , such as kb_sino-tibetan_languages .kb_other_(philosophy) than latin-based alphabets , many kb_austroasiatic_languages languages are written with the kb_khmer_alphabet , kb_thai_alphabet , kb_lao_alphabet , and kb_burmese_alphabet alphabets . kb_vietnamese_australian divergently had an kb_indigenous_peoples script based on kb_chinese_characters logographic writing . this has since been supplanted by the kb_latin_alphabet in the 20th century . the following are examples of past-used alphabets or kb_electric_current alphabets of kb_austroasiatic_languages languages .according to chaubey et al. , `` austro-asiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers in kb_indian_subcontinent today are kb_derived_trait from dispersal from kb_southeast_asia , followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local kb_indian_people populations . '' according to riccio et al. , the kb_munda_languages kb_people_(american_magazine) are likely descended from austroasiatic migrants from kb_southeast_asia .according to zhang et al. , austroasiatic migrations from kb_southeast_asia into kb_indian_subcontinent took kb_place_of_articulation after the kb_last_glacial_maximum glacial maximum , circa 10,000 years ago . arunkumar et kb_aluminium .

1860s , the main constituent kb_chemical_element within the broader kb_afroasiatic_languages kb_family_(biology) had been worked out .kb_friedrich_müller_(linguist) müller introduced the kb_toponymy `` hamito-semitic '' for the entire kb_family_(biology) in kb_histidine `` grundriss der sprachwissenschaft '' ( 1876 ) . kb_maurice_delafosse delafosse ( 1914 ) later kb_neologism the kb_terminology `` kb_afroasiatic_languages '' ( often now spelled `` kb_afro-asiatic_languages '' ) . however , kb_it did not come into kb_general_(united_states) use until kb_joseph_greenberg greenberg ( 1950 ) formally kb_anatolian_hypothesis its adoption . in doing kb_sulfate , greenberg sought to emphasize the kb_fact that kb_afroasiatic_languages spanned the kb_the_americas of both kb_africa and kb_asia_(roman_province) .kb_individual scholars have also called the kb_family_(biology) `` erythraean '' ( tucker 1966 ) and `` lisramic '' ( hodge kb_1972_wimbledon_championships ) . in lieu of `` hamito-semitic '' , the kb_russian_alphabet linguist kb_igor_diakonoff diakonoffscholars generally treat the kb_afroasiatic_languages kb_language_family as including the following kb_branches_of_science :although there is kb_general_(united_states) kb_agreement_(linguistics) on these six kb_family_(biology) , kb_linguistics kb_world_health_organization kb_science kb_afroasiatic_languages raise some points of disagreement , in kb_particular :in the 9th century , the kb_hebrew_alphabet grammarian kb_judah_ibn_kuraish ibn kb_quraysh of kb_tiaret in kb_algeria was the kb_first_trimester to link kb_2_(number) kb_branches_of_science of kb_afroasiatic_languages together ; kb_he_(letter) perceived kb_a relationship between kb_berber_languages and

kb_rilindja_kombëtare century , europeans also began suggesting such relationships . in 1844 , kb_theodor_benfey benfey suggested kb_a kb_language_family consisting of kb_semitic_languages , kb_berber_languages , and kb_cushitic_languages ( calling the latter `` kb_ge'ez_language '' ) . in the same year , t.n . newman suggested kb_a relationship between kb_semitic_languages and kb_hausa_people , but this would kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) remain kb_a kb_topic_(linguistics) of kb_cleveland_browns_relocation_controversy and kb_uncertainty .kb_friedrich_müller_(linguist) müller kb_english_alphabet#letter_names the traditional hamito-semitic kb_family_(biology) in 1876 in kb_histidine `` grundriss der sprachwissenschaft '' ( `` outline

kb_egyptian_language , kb_berber_languages , and kb_cushitic_languages ; kb_he_(letter) excluded the kb_chadic_languages kb_group_(periodic_table) . kb_it was the kb_egyptology kb_karl_richard_lepsius richard lepsius ( 1810–1884 ) kb_world_health_organization restricted hamitic to the non-semitic languages in kb_africa , which are characterized by kb_a kb_grammatical_gender kb_grammatical_gender system . this `` hamitic kb_language kb_group_(periodic_table) '' was kb_anatolian_hypothesis to unite various , mainly north-african , languages , including the kb_ancient_egyptian_medicine kb_language , the kb_berber_languages , the kb_cushitic_languages , the kb_beja_language kb_language , and the kb_chadic_languages . unlike müller , lepsius considered that kb_hausa_people and kb_nama_languagein 1912 , kb_carl_meinhof meinhof published `` die sprachen der hamiten '' ( `` the languages of the hamites '' ) , in which kb_he_(letter) expanded lepsius 's kb_rutherford_model , adding the kb_fula_language , kb_maasai_language , kb_bari_language , kb_nandi_languages , kb_sandawe_language and kb_hadza_people languages to the hamitic kb_group_(periodic_table) . meinhof 's kb_rutherford_model was widely kb_catalyst_support into the kb_1940s . meinhof 's system of kb_statistical_classification of the hamitic languages was based on kb_a belief that `` kb_appledesign_powered_speakers of hamitic became largely coterminous with kb_cattle herding kb_people's_party_of_armenia with essentially caucasian origins , intrinsically different from and superior to the 'negroes of kb_africa ' . '' however , in the case of the so-called kb_nilo-hamitic_languages languages ( kb_a kb_concept kb_he_(letter) introduced ) , kb_it was based on the kb_linguistic_typology kb_i_shot_andy_warhol of gender and kb_a `` fallacious kb_theory of kb_mixed_language . '' meinhof did this although kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet kb_cold_working by scholars such as lepsius and johnston had substantiated that the languages which kb_he_(letter) would later dub `` nilo-hamitic '' were in kb_fact nilotic languages , with numerous similarities in vocabulary to kb_other_(philosophy) nilotic languages .kb_leo_reinisch reinisch ( 1909 ) had already kb_anatolian_hypothesis linking kb_cushitic_languages and kb_chadic_languages , while urging their more distant affinity with kb_egyptian_language and kb_semitic_languages . however , kb_histidine suggestion found little acceptance . kb_marcel_cohen kb_paul_cohen ( 1924 ) rejected the idea of kb_a distinct `` hamitic '' subgroup , and included kb_hausa_people ( kb_a kb_chadic_languages kb_language ) in kb_histidine comparative hamito-semitic vocabulary . finally , kb_joseph_greenberg greenberg 's 1950 kb_cold_working kb_light-emitting_diode to the widespread rejection of `` hamitic '' as kb_a kb_language category by kb_linguistics . greenberg refuted meinhof 's kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_theories , and rejected the use of kb_race_(classification_of_human_beings) and kb_social_anarchism kb_evidence_(law) . in dismissing the notion of kb_a separate `` nilo-hamitic '' kb_language category in kb_particular , greenberg was `` returning to kb_a view widely held kb_a half century kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet . '' kb_he_(letter) consequently rejoined meinhof 's so-called kb_nilo-hamitic_languages languages with their appropriate nilotic siblings . kb_he_(letter) also added ( and sub-classified ) the kb_chadic_languages , and kb_anatolian_hypothesis the kb_new_world kb_toponymy kb_afroasiatic_languages for the kb_family_(biology) . kb_almost_all all scholars have kb_acceptance#self_acceptance this kb_statistical_classification as the kb_new_world and continued consensus .greenberg 's kb_rutherford_model was fully kb_adaptation in kb_histidine book `` kb_the_languages_of_africa languages of kb_africa '' ( 1963 ) , in which kb_he_(letter) reassigned most of meinhof 's additions to hamitic to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_language_family , notably kb_nilo-saharan . following kb_isaac_schapera schapera and rejecting meinhof , kb_he_(letter) classified the kb_hottentot_language kb_language as kb_a member of the kb_khoisan_languages languages , kb_a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of kb_click_consonant sounds . to khoisan kb_he_(letter) also added the tanzanian kb_hadza_people and kb_sandawe_language , though this view has been discredited as kb_linguistics working on these languages consider them to kb_beryllium kb_language_isolate . despite this , greenberg 's kb_statistical_classification remains kb_a starting point for kb_modern_history kb_cold_working of many languages spoken in kb_africa , and the hamitic category ( and its kb_extension_(kinesiology) to nilo-hamitic ) has no part in this .since the kb_triliteral traditional kb_branches_of_science of the hamitic languages ( kb_berber_languages , kb_cushitic_languages and kb_egyptian_language ) have not been shown to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism an exclusive ( kb_monophyly ) kb_phylogenetics kb_units_of_measurement of their own , separate from kb_other_(philosophy) kb_afroasiatic_languages languages , kb_linguistics no longer use the kb_terminology in this kb_word_sense . each of these kb_branches_of_science is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger kb_afroasiatic_languages kb_family_(biology) .in 1969 , kb_harold_c._fleming fleming kb_anatolian_hypothesis that what had previously been known as kb_western_esotericism kb_cushitic_languages is an independent branch of kb_afroasiatic_languages , suggesting for kb_it the kb_new_world kb_toponymy kb_omotic_languages . this proposal and kb_toponymy have kb_methionine with widespread acceptance .several scholars , including kb_harold_c._fleming fleming and kb_robert_hetzron hetzron , have since questioned the traditional inclusion of beja in kb_cushitic_languages .`` kb_glottolog '' does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of kb_omotic_languages has been established , nor that of kb_ongota_language or the unclassified kb_kujarge_language . kb_it therefore splits off the following kb_group_(mathematics) as small kb_family_(biology) : kb_south_omotic_languages , kb_mao_languages , kb_dizoid_languages , kb_gonga–gimojan_languages ( kb_north kb_omotic_languages apart from the preceding ) , kb_ongota_language , kb_kujarge_language .little kb_agreement_(linguistics) exists on the kb_subgrouping_(linguistics) of the five or six kb_branches_of_science of kb_afroasiatic_languages : kb_semitic_languages , kb_egyptian_language , kb_berber_languages , kb_chadic_languages , kb_cushitic_languages , and kb_omotic_languages . however , kb_christopher_ehret ehret ( 1979 ) , kb_harold_c._fleming fleming ( 1981 ) , and kb_joseph_greenberg greenberg ( 1981 ) all agree that the kb_omotic_languages branch split from the rest kb_first_trimester .otherwise :kb_afroasiatic_languages is

kb_grammatical_number divided by the count of kb_grammatical_number in the kb_class_(set_theory) . the kb_class_(set_theory) is often kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of results of an kb_experiment or an kb_observational_study , or frequently kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of results from kb_a kb_survey_(statistics) . the kb_terminology `` kb_arithmetic kb_mean '' is preferred in some contexts in kb_mathematics and kb_statistics because kb_it helps distinguish kb_it from kb_other_(philosophy) means , such as the kb_geometric_mean and the kb_harmonic_mean .in kb_addition to kb_mathematics and kb_statistics , the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is used frequently in many diverse fields such as kb_economics , kb_anthropological_linguistics , and kb_history , and kb_it is used in almost every academic field to some extent . for example , kb_per_capita_income kb_income is the kb_arithmetic average kb_income of kb_a nation 's kb_population .while the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is often used to report kb_central_tendency , kb_it is not kb_a kb_robust_statistic statistic , kb_meaning_(linguistics) that kb_it is greatly influenced by outliers ( values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values ) . notably , for skewed distributions , such as the kb_distribution_of_income of kb_income for which kb_a few kb_people_(american_magazine) 's incomes are substantially greater than most kb_people_(american_magazine) 's , the kb_arithmetic kb_mean may not coincide with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's notion of `` middle '' , and robust kb_statistics , such as the kb_medes , may kb_beryllium kb_a better description of kb_central_europe tendency .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean ( or kb_mean or average ) , formula_1 ( kb_walter_read formula_2 `` bar '' ) , is the kb_mean of the formula_3 values formula_4 .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is the most commonly used and readily understood kb_measure_(mathematics) of kb_central_europe tendency in kb_a kb_data_set . in kb_statistics , the kb_terminology average refers to any of the measures of kb_central_europe tendency . the kb_arithmetic kb_mean of kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of observed kb_big_data is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as kb_being equal to the kb_addition of the numerical values of each and every kb_observation divided by the total kb_grammatical_number of kb_observations_(pierre_belon) . symbolically , if we have kb_a kb_data_set consisting of the values formula_5 , then the kb_arithmetic kb_mean formula_6 is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity by the kb_chemical_formula :( kb_episcopal_see kb_summation for an explanation of the kb_summation_operator ) .for example , let kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of kb_a firm : 2500 , 2700 , 2400 , 2300 , 2550 , 2650 , 2750 , 2450 , 2600 , 2400. the kb_arithmetic kb_mean isif the kb_data_set is kb_a kb_statistical_population ( i.e. , consists of every possible kb_observation and not just kb_a subset of them ) , then the kb_mean of that kb_population is called the kb_population kb_mean . if the kb_data_set is kb_a kb_sampling_(statistics) ( kb_a subset of the kb_population ) , we call the statistic resulting from this kb_calculation kb_a kb_sample_(statistics) kb_mean .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean has several kb_chemical_property that make kb_it useful , especially as kb_a kb_measure_(mathematics) of kb_central_europe tendency . these include :the kb_arithmetic kb_mean may kb_beryllium contrasted with the kb_medes . the kb_medes is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity such that no more than half the values are larger than , and no more than half are smaller than , the kb_medes . if kb_chemical_element in the kb_big_data kb_arithmetic_progression arithmeticallyif kb_a numerical kb_property , and any kb_sample_(statistics) of kb_big_data from kb_it , could kb_take on any kb_lightness from kb_a kb_continuous_function range , instead of , for example , just integers , then the kb_probability of kb_a kb_grammatical_number falling into some range of possible values can kb_beryllium described by integrating kb_a kb_continuous_probability_distribution distribution across this range , even when the naive kb_probability for kb_a kb_sample_(statistics) kb_grammatical_number taking kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) certain kb_lightness from infinitely many is kb_0_(number) . the kb_analog_device of kb_a kb_weighted_average average in this kb_context_(language_use) , in which there are an kb_infinite_set kb_grammatical_number of possibilities for the precise kb_lightness of the variable in each range , is called the `` kb_mean of the kb_probability_distribution '' . kb_a most widely encountered kb_probability_distribution is called the kb_normal_distribution distribution ; kb_it has the kb_property that all measures of its kb_central_europe tendency , including not just the kb_mean but also the aforementioned kb_medes and the kb_musical_mode ( the kb_triliteral kb_mole_(unit) 's ) , are equal to each kb_other_(philosophy) . this equality does not hold for kb_other_(philosophy) kb_probability distributions , as illustrated for the kb_lognormal_distribution distribution here .kb_particular care must kb_beryllium taken when using cyclic kb_big_data , such as kb_phase_(waves) or angles . naïvely taking the kb_arithmetic kb_mean of 1° and 359° yields kb_a result of

artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range . kb_a kb_solid_solution to this problem is to use the kb_optimization_theory formulation ( kb_viz. , define the kb_mean as the kb_central_europe point : the point about which kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) has the lowest kb_dispersion_(optics) ) , and redefine the difference as kb_a modular kb_distance ( i.e. , the kb_distance on the kb_circle : kb_sulfate the modular kb_distance between 1° and 359° is 2° , not 358° ) .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is often denoted by kb_a bar , for example as in formula_1 ( kb_walter_read formula_2 `` bar '' ) .some software ( kb_text_processing processors , kb_world_wide_web browsers ) may not kb_computer_monitor the x̄ kb_symbol properly . for example , the x̄

kb_a brutal kb_dictatorship , built upon kb_a kb_cult_of_personality kb_personality and enforced by kb_great_purge of terror . in kb_einstein–szilárd_letter to yvonne davet , orwell described ``

reptiles and kb_other_(philosophy) vertebrates . over kb_time_(magazine) , amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity , leaving only the kb_modern_history subclass kb_lissamphibia .the kb_triliteral kb_modern_history kb_order_(biology) of amphibians are kb_anura_(frog) ( the frogs and toads ) , kb_urodela ( the salamanders ) , and kb_caecilian ( the caecilians ) . the kb_grammatical_number of known kb_amphibian kb_species is approximately 7,000 , of which nearly 90 % are frogs . the smallest kb_amphibian ( and kb_vertebrate ) in the kb_world is kb_a kb_frog from

both reptiles and amphibians is called kb_herpetologykb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_amphibian '' is kb_derived_trait from the kb_ancient_greek kb_terminology ἀμφίβιος ( `` amphíbios '' ) , which means `` both kinds of kb_life_(magazine) '' , `` ἀμφί '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` of both kinds '' and `` βιος '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_life_(magazine) '' . the kb_terminology was initially used as kb_a kb_general_(united_states) kb_adjective for kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing that could live on kb_albanian_land_force or in kb_water , including kb_pinniped and otters . traditionally , the kb_class_(biology) amphibia includes all kb_tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes . amphibia in its widest kb_word_sense ( `` kb_sensu_lato '' ) was divided into kb_triliteral kb_class_(biology)the actual kb_grammatical_number of kb_species in each kb_group_(periodic_table) depends on the kb_taxonomy_(general) kb_statistical_classification followed . the kb_2_(number) most

reference database `` kb_amphibian kb_species of the kb_world '' . the kb_grammatical_number of kb_species cited above follows frost and the total kb_grammatical_number of known kb_amphibian kb_species is over 7,000 , of which nearly 90 % are frogs .with the kb_phylogenetics kb_statistical_classification , the taxon kb_labyrinthodontia has been discarded as kb_it is kb_a kb_paraphyly kb_group_(periodic_table) without unique kb_definable_set features apart from kb_cladistics#plesiomorphy kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) characteristics . kb_statistical_classification varies according to the preferred kb_phylogeny of the author and whether they use kb_a kb_cladistics#three_definitions_of_clade or kb_a node-based kb_statistical_classification . traditionally , amphibians as kb_a kb_class_(biology) are kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as all tetrapods with kb_a larval stage , while the kb_group_(periodic_table) that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians ( frogs , salamanders and caecilians ) and all their descendants is called kb_lissamphibia . the kb_phylogeny of kb_paleozoic amphibians is kb_uncertainty , and kb_lissamphibia may possibly fall within kb_extinct kb_group_(mathematics) , like the kb_temnospondyli ( traditionally placed in the subclass kb_labyrinthodontia ) or the kb_lepospondyli , and in some analyses even in the amniotes . this

kb_group_(mathematics) that were formerly placed in amphibia in kb_linnaean_taxonomy kb_taxonomy_(biology) , and included them elsewhere under kb_cladistic_taxonomy . if the kb_common_descent kb_ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in amphibia , kb_it becomes kb_a kb_paraphyly kb_group_(periodic_table) .all kb_modern_history amphibians are included in the subclass kb_lissamphibia , which is usually considered kb_a kb_clade , kb_a kb_group_(periodic_table) of kb_species that have kb_evolution_of_tetrapods from kb_a kb_common_descent kb_ancestor . the kb_triliteral kb_modern_history kb_order_(biology) are kb_anura_(frog) ( the frogs and toads ) , kb_caudata ( or kb_urodela , the salamanders ) , and kb_gymnophiona ( or kb_caecilian , the caecilians ) . kb_it has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from kb_a temnospondyl-like kb_ancestor , and even that caecilians are the kb_sister_group kb_group_(periodic_table) of the advanced kb_reptiliomorpha amphibians , and thus of amniotes . although the fossils of several older proto-frogs with kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) characteristics are known , the oldest `` kb_truth kb_frog '' is `` kb_prosalirus_bitis bitis '' , from the kb_early_jurassic kb_jurassic kb_kayenta_formation formation of arizona . kb_it is anatomically very similar to kb_modern_history frogs . the oldest known kb_caecilian is another kb_early_jurassic kb_jurassic kb_species , `` kb_eocaecilia_micropodia micropodia '' , also from arizona . the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century kb_salamander is `` kb_beiyanerpeton_jianpingensis jianpingensis '' from the kb_late_jurassic kb_jurassic of kb_northern_mountain_range_(albania) kb_china .authorities disagree as to whether salientia is kb_a kb_superorder that includes the kb_order_(biology) kb_anura_(frog) , or whether kb_anura_(frog) is kb_a sub-order of the kb_order_(biology) salientia . the kb_lissamphibia are traditionally divided into kb_triliteral kb_order_(biology) , but an kb_extinct salamander-like kb_family_(biology) , the kb_albanerpetontidae , is now considered part of kb_lissamphibia alongside the kb_superorder salientia . furthermore , salientia includes all kb_triliteral recent kb_order_(biology) plus the kb_triassic proto-frog , `` kb_triadobatrachus '' .the kb_first_trimester kb_major_(united_states) kb_group_(mathematics) of amphibians kb_adaptation in the kb_devonian period , around 370 million years ago , from kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish which were similar to the kb_modern_history kb_coelacanth and kb_lungfish . these kb_ancient_history kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish had kb_evolution_of_tetrapods multi-jointed leg-like kb_fish_fin with digits that enabled them to crawl along the kb_sea_(astronomy) bottom . some kb_fish had kb_adaptation kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) kb_artificial_lung to help them breathe kb_air_(classical_element) when the stagnant pools of the kb_devonian swamps were low in kb_oxygen . they could also use their kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_fish_fin to hoist themselves out of the kb_water and onto dry kb_albanian_land_force if circumstances kb_sulfate required . eventually , their bony kb_fish_fin would kb_evolution into kb_limb_(anatomy) and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods , including kb_modern_history amphibians , reptiles , kb_birds , and mammals . despite kb_being able to crawl on kb_albanian_land_force , many of these kb_prehistory kb_tetrapodomorph kb_fish still spent most of their kb_time_(magazine) in the kb_water . they had started to develop kb_artificial_lung , but still breathed predominantly with gills .many examples of kb_species showing kb_transitional_fossil features have been discovered . `` kb_ichthyostega '' was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) amphibians , with nostrils and more efficient kb_artificial_lung . kb_it had four sturdy kb_limb_(anatomy) , kb_a kb_neck , kb_a kb_tail with kb_fish_fin and kb_a skull very similar to that of the kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish , `` kb_eusthenopteron '' . amphibians kb_evolution_of_tetrapods adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the kb_water for longer periods . their kb_artificial_lung improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger , better able to support the weight of their bodies on kb_albanian_land_force . they kb_adaptation `` hands '' and `` kb_foot '' with five or more digits ; the kb_skin became more capable of retaining kb_human_body fluids and resisting kb_desiccation . the kb_fish 's kb_hyomandibula kb_bone in the kb_hyoid_bone kb_region behind the gills diminished in size and became the kb_stapes of the kb_amphibian kb_ear , an kb_adaptation necessary for kb_hearing_loss on dry kb_albanian_land_force . an affinity between the amphibians and the kb_teleost kb_fish is the multi-folded kb_structure of the kb_tooth and the paired kb_occipital_bone kb_bones_(studio)at the end of the kb_devonian period ( 360 million years ago ) , the seas , kb_list_of_rivers_of_alberta and kb_list_of_lakes_in_alberta were teeming with kb_life_(magazine) while the kb_albanian_land_force was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates , though some , such as `` kb_ichthyostega '' , may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the kb_water . kb_it is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs , dragging their hindquarters in kb_a similar manner to that used by the kb_elephant_seal . in the early kb_carboniferous ( 360 to 345 million years ago ) , the kb_climate_of_albania became wet and warm . extensive swamps kb_adaptation with mosses , ferns , horsetails and kb_calamites . air-breathing arthropods kb_evolution_of_tetrapods and invaded the kb_albanian_land_force where they provided kb_food_industry for the kb_carnivore amphibians that began to kb_ego_psychology to the kb_terrestrial_animal environment . there were no kb_other_(philosophy) tetrapods on the kb_albanian_land_force and the amphibians were at the top of the kb_food_chain , occupying the ecological kb_positional_notation currently held by the kb_crocodile . though equipped with kb_limb_(anatomy) and the ability to breathe kb_air_(classical_element) , most still had kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) tapering kb_human_body and kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_tail . they were the top kb_albanian_land_force kb_predation , sometimes reaching several metres in kb_length , preying on the kb_prespa_lake insects of the period and the many types of kb_fish in the kb_water . they still needed to return to kb_water to lay their shell-less kb_eggs_as_food , and even most kb_modern_history amphibians have kb_a fully kb_aquatic_plant larval stage with gills like their kb_fish ancestors . kb_it was the development of the kb_amniote egg , which prevents the developing kb_embryo from drying out , that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on kb_albanian_land_force and which kb_light-emitting_diode to their kb_dominance_(ecology) in the period that followed .after the kb_carboniferous_rainforest_collapse collapse kb_amphibian kb_dominance_(ecology) gave way to reptiles , and amphibians were further devastated by the kb_permian–triassic_extinction_event kb_extinction_event . during the kb_triassic ( 250 to 200 million years ago ) , the reptiles continued to out-compete the amphibians , leading to kb_a kb_redox in both the amphibians ' size and their importance in the kb_biosphere . according to the kb_fossil_record , kb_lissamphibia , which includes all kb_modern_history amphibians and is the only surviving lineage , may have branched off from the kb_extinct kb_group_(mathematics) kb_temnospondyli and kb_lepospondyli at some period between the late kb_carboniferous and the early kb_triassic . the relative kb_scarcity of kb_fossil kb_evidence_(law) precludes precise dating , but the most recent kb_molecular_genetics kb_science , based on kb_multilocus_sequence_typing sequence typing , suggests kb_a late carboniferous/early kb_permianthe origins and evolutionary relationships between the kb_triliteral main kb_group_(mathematics) of amphibians is kb_a kb_matter of kb_abortion_debate . kb_a kb_2005_games_of_the_small_states_of_europe kb_molecular_genetics kb_phylogeny , based on kb_ribosomal_dna kb_analysis , suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each kb_other_(philosophy) than they are to frogs . kb_it also appears that the kb_divergence of the kb_triliteral kb_group_(mathematics) took kb_place_of_articulation in the kb_paleozoic or early kb_mesozoic ( around 250 million years ago ) , before the breakup of the kb_supercontinent kb_pangaea and soon after their kb_divergence from the kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish . the briefness of this period , and the swiftness with which kb_radiation took kb_place_of_articulation , would help account for the relative kb_scarcity of kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) kb_amphibian fossils . there are kb_prespa_lake gaps in the kb_fossil_record , but the discovery of kb_a kb_gerobatrachus_hottoni hottoni from the early kb_permian in kb_texas in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 provided kb_a missing link with many of the characteristics of kb_modern_history frogs . kb_molecular_phylogenetics suggests that the frog–salamander kb_divergence took kb_place_of_articulation considerably kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet than the kb_paleontology kb_evidence_(law) indicates . newer kb_research indicates that the kb_common_descent kb_ancestor of all lissamphibians lived about 315 million years ago , and that kb_stereospondyli are the closest relatives to the caecilians .as they kb_evolution_of_tetrapods from lunged kb_fish , amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on kb_albanian_land_force , including the need to develop kb_new_world means of locomotion . in the kb_water , the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward , but on kb_albanian_land_force , quite different mechanisms were required . their vertebral columns , kb_limb_(anatomy) , kb_lunar_limb girdles and musculature needed to kb_beryllium kb_strong_nuclear_force enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding . kb_terrestrial_animal adults discarded their kb_lateral_line kb_line_(geometry) kb_systems_analysis and adapted their kb_sensory_system kb_systems_analysis to receive kb_stimulus_(psychology) via the kb_list_of_art_mediums of the kb_air_(classical_element) . they needed to develop kb_new_world methods to regulate their kb_human_body kb_heat_(1972_film) to kb_coping_(psychology) with fluctuations in ambient kb_temperature . they kb_adaptation behaviours suitable for kb_biological_reproduction in kb_a kb_terrestrial_animal environment . their kb_seed_coat were exposed to harmful kb_ultraviolet kb_ray_(geometry) that had previously been absorbed by the kb_water . the kb_skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive kb_water loss .the superclass kb_tetrapoda is divided into four classes of kb_vertebrate kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing with four kb_limb_(anatomy) . reptiles , kb_birds and mammals are amniotes , the kb_eggs_as_food of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes , some of which are impervious . lacking these membranes , amphibians require kb_water bodies for kb_biological_reproduction , although some kb_species have kb_adaptation various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable kb_aquatic_plant larval stage . they are not found in the kb_sea_(astronomy) with the exception of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or kb_2_(number) frogs that live in kb_brackish_water kb_water in kb_mangrove swamps ; the anderson 's kb_salamander meanwhile occurs in brackish or kb_salt_(chemistry) kb_water kb_list_of_lakes_in_alberta . on kb_albanian_land_force , amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their kb_skin damp

kb_it has an average kb_length of and is part of kb_a kb_genus that contains four of the kb_world 's ten smallest kb_frog kb_species . the kb_largest_organisms living kb_amphibian is the

kb_frog ( `` conraua goliath '' ) , which can reach and weigh .amphibians are ectothermic ( cold-blooded ) vertebrates that do not maintain their kb_human_body kb_temperature through internal kb_physiology processes . their kb_metabolic_rate is low and as kb_a result , their kb_food_industry and kb_energy_industry kb_requirement_analysis are limited . in the adult kb_state_of_matter , they

kb_triliteral kb_bicameralism , kb_2_(number) kb_atrium_(heart) and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_ventricle_(heart) . they have kb_a kb_urinary_bladder kb_bladder and kb_metabolic_waste#nitrogen_wastes waste products are excreted primarily as kb_urea . most amphibians lay their kb_eggs_as_food in kb_water and have kb_aquatic_plant kb_larvae that undergo kb_metamorphosis to become kb_terrestrial_animal adults . amphibians breathe by means of kb_a pump action in which kb_air_(classical_element) is kb_first_trimester kb_drawing_(metalworking) into the kb_buccopharyngeal_membrane kb_region through the nostrils . these are then closed and the kb_air_(classical_element) is forced into the kb_artificial_lung by kb_contraction_(grammar) of the throat .

range in size from the kb_goliath_frog kb_frog ( `` conraua goliath '' ) of kb_west_africa to the `` kb_paedophryne_amauensis amauensis '' , kb_first_trimester described in kb_papua_new_guinea kb_new_guinea in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2012 , which is also the smallest known kb_vertebrate . although most kb_species are associated with kb_water and damp habitats , some are specialised to live in kb_trees or in deserts . they are found worldwide except for kb_polar_molecule areas .kb_anura_(frog) is divided into kb_triliteral suborders that are broadly kb_acceptance#self_acceptance by the kb_scientific_community , but the relationships between some kb_family_(biology) remain unclear . future kb_molecular_genetics studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships . the suborder kb_archaeobatrachia contains four kb_family_(biology) of kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) frogs . these are kb_ascaphidae , kb_bombinatoridae , kb_discoglossidae and kb_leiopelmatidae which have few kb_derived_trait features and are probably kb_paraphyly with regard to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_frog kb_lineage_(anthropology) . the six kb_family_(biology) in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder kb_mesobatrachia are the kb_fossorial kb_megophryidae , kb_pelobatidae , kb_pelodytidae , kb_scaphiopodidae and kb_rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily kb_aquatic_plant kb_pipidae . these have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the kb_2_(number) kb_other_(philosophy) suborders . kb_neobatrachiathe kb_order_(biology) kb_caudata ( from the kb_latin `` cauda '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_tail '' ) consists of the salamanders—elongated , low-slung kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing that mostly resemble kb_lizards in kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . this is kb_a kb_symplesiomorphy kb_trait_theory and they are no more closely related to kb_lizards than they are to mammals . salamanders lack claws , have scale-free kb_seed_coat , either smooth or covered with tubercles , and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned . they range in size from the kb_chinese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias davidianus '' ) , which has been reported to grow to kb_a kb_length of , to the diminutive `` kb_thorius_pennatulus pennatulus '' from kb_mexico which seldom exceeds in kb_length . salamanders have kb_a mostly laurasian distribution , kb_being present in much of the kb_holarctic kb_region of the kb_northern_hemisphere . the kb_family_(biology) kb_plethodontidae is also found in kb_central_america and kb_south_america kb_north of the kb_amazon_basin ; kb_south_america was apparently invaded from kb_central_america by about the start of the kb_miocene , 23 million years ago . kb_urodela is kb_a kb_toponymy sometimes used for all the kb_extant_taxon kb_species of salamanders . members of several kb_salamander kb_family_(biology) have become kb_neotenythe suborder kb_cryptobranchoidea contains the kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) salamanders . kb_a kb_grammatical_number of kb_fossil cryptobranchids have been found , but there are only kb_triliteral living kb_species , the kb_chinese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias davidianus '' ) , the kb_japanese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias japonicus '' ) and the kb_hellbender ( `` cryptobranchus alleganiensis '' ) from kb_north_america . these kb_prespa_lake amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult kb_state_of_matter ; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded . kb_a unique kb_i_shot_andy_warhol is their ability to kb_animal_feed by suction , depressing either the kb_left-wing_politics side of their lower kb_jaw or the kb_right-wing_politics . the males excavate nests , persuade females to lay their egg kb_string_section inside them , and guard them . as kb_water_well as breathing with kb_artificial_lung , they respire through the many

in this kb_group_(periodic_table) is kb_plethodontidae , the lungless salamanders , which includes 60 % of all kb_salamander kb_species . the kb_family_(biology) kb_salamandridae includes the kb_truth

lack the cloacal glands used by kb_male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecaethe kb_order_(biology) kb_gymnophiona ( from the kb_ancient_greek `` gymnos '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` naked '' and `` ophis '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` serpent '' ) or kb_caecilian ( from the kb_latin `` an- '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` without '' and the kb_ancient_greek `` poda '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_human_leg '' ) comprises the caecilians . these are kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , cylindrical , limbless kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing with kb_a snake- or kb_annelid kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . the adults vary in kb_length from kb_group_8_element to 75 centimetres ( 3 to 30 inches ) with the exception of kb_thomas_thomson_(chemist) 's kb_caecilian ( `` caecilia thompsoni '' ) , which can reach . kb_a kb_caecilian 's kb_skin has kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of kb_transverse_wave kb_fold_(geology) and in some kb_species contains tiny kb_embedded_system dermal kb_fish_scale . kb_it has rudimentary eyes covered in kb_skin , which are probably limited to discerning differences in kb_light intensity . kb_it also has kb_a pair of short tentacles near the kb_human_eye that can kb_beryllium extended and which have kb_somatosensory_system and kb_olfaction functions . most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp kb_soil , in rotten kb_wood and under kb_plant debris , but some are kb_aquatic_plant . most kb_species lay their kb_eggs_as_food underground and when the kb_larvae hatch , they make their way to adjacent bodies of kb_water . others brood their kb_eggs_as_food and the kb_larvae undergo kb_metamorphosis before the kb_eggs_as_food hatch . kb_a few kb_species give birth to live kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the kb_oviduct . caecilians have kb_a mostly gondwanan kb_structure contains some typical characteristics common to kb_terrestrial_animal vertebrates , such as the presence of highly kb_keratin#cornification outer layers , renewed periodically through kb_a moulting process controlled by the kb_pituitary_gland and kb_thyroid glands . local thickenings ( often called warts ) are common , such as those found on toads . the outside of the kb_skin is shed periodically mostly in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) piece , in kb_contrast_(vision) to mammals and kb_birds where kb_it is shed in kb_lithic_flake . amphibians often kb_eat_(film) the sloughed kb_skin . caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal kb_fish_scale kb_embedded_system in the kb_dermis between the furrows in the kb_skin . the similarity of these to the kb_fish_scale of kb_bony_fish kb_fish is largely superficial . kb_lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony kb_deposit_(geology) in the kb_dermis , but this is an example of kb_convergent_evolutionkb_amphibian kb_skin is permeable to kb_water . kb_gas_exchange can kb_take kb_place_of_articulation through the kb_skin ( kb_cutaneous_respiration respiration ) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the kb_surface_(topology) of kb_water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds . to compensate for their thin and delicate kb_skin , amphibians have kb_evolution_of_tetrapods mucous glands , principally on their heads , backs and tails . the secretions produced by these help keep the kb_skin moist . in kb_addition , most kb_species of kb_amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or kb_poisonous substances . some kb_amphibian toxins can kb_beryllium lethal to humans while others have little effect . the main poison-producing glands , the kb_parotoid_gland , produce the kb_neurotoxin kb_bufotoxin and are located behind the kb_ears of toads , along the backs of frogs , behind the eyes of salamanders and on the kb_upper_egypt kb_surface_(topology) of caecilians .the kb_skin colour of amphibians is produced by kb_triliteral layers of kb_pigment kb_cell_(biology) called chromatophores . these kb_triliteral kb_cell_(biology) layers consist of the melanophores ( occupying the deepest layer ) , the guanophores ( forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules , producing kb_a blue-green colour ) and the lipophores ( yellow , the most superficial layer ) . the colour change displayed by many kb_species is initiated by hormones secreted by the kb_pituitary_gland kb_gland . unlike kb_bony_fish kb_fish , there is no direct control of the kb_pigment kb_cell_(biology) by the kb_nervous_system system , and this results in the colour change taking kb_place_of_articulation more slowly than happens in kb_fish . kb_a vividly coloured kb_skin usually indicates that the kb_species is kb_toxicity and is kb_a warning kb_sign_(mathematics) to kb_predation .amphibians have kb_a kb_skeleton system that is structurally kb_homology_(chemistry) to kb_other_(philosophy) tetrapods , though with kb_a kb_grammatical_number of variations . they all have four kb_limb_(anatomy) except for the legless caecilians and kb_a few kb_species of kb_salamander with kb_redox or no kb_limb_(anatomy) . the kb_bones_(studio) are hollow and lightweight . the musculoskeletal system is kb_strong_nuclear_force to enable kb_it to support the kb_human_head and kb_human_body . the kb_bones_(studio) are fully kb_ossification and the vertebrae kb_interlock with each kb_other_(philosophy) by means of overlapping processes . the kb_pectoral_girdle girdle is kb_catalyst_support by kb_muscle , and the well-developed kb_pelvic_girdle girdle is attached to the backbone by kb_a pair of sacral ribs . the kb_ilium_(bone)in most amphibians , there are four digits on the fore kb_hiking and five on the hind kb_hiking , but no claws on either . some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in kb_appearance_(philosophy) with tiny , stubby kb_human_leg . the kb_siren_(genus) are kb_aquatic_plant salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind kb_limb_(anatomy) . the caecilians are limbless . they kb_burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of kb_muscle kb_contraction_(grammar) moving along the kb_human_body . on the kb_surface_(topology) of the ground or in kb_water they move by undulating their kb_human_body from side to side .in frogs , the hind kb_human_leg are larger than the fore kb_human_leg , especially kb_sulfate in those kb_species that principally move by jumping or swimming . in the walkers and runners the hind kb_limb_(anatomy) are not kb_sulfate kb_prespa_lake , and the burrowers mostly have short kb_limb_(anatomy) and broad bodies . the kb_foot have adaptations for the way of kb_life_(magazine) , with webbing between the toes for swimming , broad kb_adhesive toe pads for climbing , and keratinised tubercles on the hind kb_foot for digging ( frogs usually dig backwards into the kb_soil ) . in most salamanders , the kb_limb_(anatomy) are short and more or less the same kb_length and kb_project at kb_right-wing_politics angles from the kb_human_body . locomotion on kb_albanian_land_force is by kb_walking and the kb_tail often swings from side to side or is used as kb_a prop , particularly when climbing . in their normal gait , only kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) leg is advanced at kb_a kb_time_(magazine) in the manner kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by their ancestors , the kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish . some salamanders in the kb_genus `` kb_aneides '' and certain kb_lungless_salamander climb kb_trees and have kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_limb_(anatomy) , kb_prespa_lake toepads and prehensile tails . in kb_aquatic_plant salamanders and in kb_frog tadpoles , the kb_tail has kb_dorsum_(anatomy) and kb_ventral_fin kb_fish_fin and is moved from side to side as kb_a means of kb_#propulsion . adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones .salamanders use their tails in kb_arms_industry and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in kb_a process known as kb_autotomyamphibians have kb_a juvenile stage and an adult stage , and the circulatory kb_systems_analysis of the kb_2_(number) are distinct . in the juvenile ( or kb_tadpole ) stage , the circulation is similar to that of kb_a kb_fish ; the two-chambered kb_heart pumps the blood through the gills where kb_it is oxygenated , and is kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) around the kb_human_body and back to the kb_heart in kb_a kb_single_bond loop . in the adult stage , amphibians ( especially frogs ) lose their gills and develop kb_artificial_lung . they have kb_a kb_heart that consists of kb_a kb_single_bond kb_ventricle_(heart) and kb_2_(number) kb_atrium_(heart) . when the kb_ventricle_(heart) starts contracting , deoxygenated blood is pumped through the kb_pulmonary_artery artery to the kb_artificial_lung . continued kb_contraction_(grammar) then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the kb_human_body . mixing of the kb_2_(number) bloodstreams is minimized by the kb_comparative_anatomy of the kb_bicameralism .the kb_nervous_system system is basically the same as in kb_other_(philosophy) vertebrates , with kb_a kb_central_europe kb_brain , kb_a kb_spinal_cord cord , and nerves throughout the kb_human_body . the kb_amphibian kb_brain is less kb_water_well kb_adaptation than that of reptiles , kb_birds and mammals but is similar in kb_morphology_(linguistics) and kb_function_(biology) to that of kb_a kb_fish . kb_it is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving kb_pain_in_amphibians . the kb_brain consists of equal parts , kb_cerebrum , kb_midbrain and kb_cerebellum . various parts of the kb_cerebrum process kb_sensory_system input , such as smell in the kb_olfactory_bulb and sight in the optic lobe , and kb_it is additionally the centre of behaviour and kb_learning . the kb_cerebellum is the center of muscular kb_motor_coordination and the kb_medulla_oblongata controls some kb_organ_(music) functions including heartbeat and respiration . the kb_brain sends signals through the kb_spinal_cord cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the kb_human_body . the kb_pineal_body kb_human_body , known to regulate kb_sleep_(1963_film) patterns in humans , is thought to produce the hormones involved in kb_hibernation and kb_aestivation in amphibians .tadpoles retain the kb_lateral_line_system system of their ancestral fishes , but this is kb_lost_film in kb_terrestrial_animal adult amphibians . some caecilians possess kb_electroreception that allow them to locate kb_object_relations_theory around them when submerged in kb_water . the kb_ears are kb_water_well kb_adaptation in frogs . there is no kb_external_fertilization kb_ear , but the kb_prespa_lake circular kb_tympanum_(anatomy) lies on the kb_surface_(topology) of the kb_human_head just behind the kb_human_eye . this vibrates and kb_sound is transmitted through kb_a kb_single_bond kb_bone , the kb_stapes , to the kb_inner_ear kb_ear . only high-frequency sounds like kb_mating calls are heard in this way , but low-frequency noises can kb_beryllium kb_discovery_of_the_chemical_elements through another kb_mechanism_(biology) . there is kb_a patch of specialized haircells , called `` papilla amphibiorum '' , in the kb_inner_ear kb_ear capable of detecting deeper sounds . another kb_i_shot_andy_warhol , unique to frogs and salamanders , is the columella-operculum kb_complex_number adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the kb_transmission_coefficient of both airborne and seismic signals . the kb_ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly kb_adaptation than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each kb_other_(philosophy) through the kb_list_of_art_mediums of kb_sound .the eyes of tadpoles lack lids , but at kb_metamorphosis , the kb_cornea becomes more dome-shaped , the kb_lens_(anatomy) becomes flatter , and eyelidsmany amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with kb_a sticky tip and drawing kb_it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws . some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey , repeatedly kb_thrust_fault their kb_human_head forward sharply causing the kb_food_industry to move backwards in their mouth by kb_inertia . most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing kb_sulfate they possess voluminous stomachs . the short kb_esophagus is lined with kb_cilium that help to move the kb_food_industry to the kb_stomach and kb_mucus produced by glands in the mouth and kb_pharynx eases its passage . the kb_enzyme kb_chitinase produced in the kb_stomach helps kb_digest_(roman_law) the chitinous kb_cuticle of kb_arthropod prey .amphibians possess kb_a kb_pancreas , kb_liver and kb_gall_bladder kb_bladder . the kb_liver is usually kb_prespa_lake with kb_2_(number) lobes . its size is determined by its kb_function_(biology) as kb_a kb_glycogen and kb_fat storage kb_units_of_measurement , and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up . kb_adipose_tissue kb_tissue_(biology) is another important means of storing kb_energy_industry and this occurs in the kb_abdomen ( in internal kb_structural_analysis called kb_fat bodies ) , under the kb_skin and , in some salamanders , in the kb_tail .there are kb_2_(number) kb_kidneysthe kb_artificial_lung in amphibians are kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) compared to those of amniotes , possessing few internal kb_alveolar_septum and kb_prespa_lake kb_pulmonary_alveolus , and consequently having kb_a comparatively slow kb_diffusion rate for kb_oxygen entering the blood . ventilation is accomplished by kb_buccal_pumping pumping . most amphibians , however , are able to exchange gases with the kb_water or kb_air_(classical_element) via their kb_skin . to enable sufficient kb_cutaneous_respiration respiration , the kb_surface_(topology) of their highly vascularised kb_skin must remain moist to allow the kb_oxygen to diffuse at kb_a sufficiently kb_high_middle_ages rate . because kb_oxygen kb_concentration in the kb_water increases at both low temperatures and kb_high_middle_ages kb_flow_(psychology) kb_rates_(tax) , kb_aquatic_plant amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on kb_cutaneous_respiration respiration , as in the kb_telmatobius_culeus kb_water kb_frog and the kb_cryptobranchus . in kb_air_(classical_element) , where kb_oxygen is more concentrated , some small kb_species can rely solely on cutaneous kb_gas_exchange , most famously the kb_plethodontidae , which have neither kb_artificial_lung nor gills . many kb_aquatic_plant salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage , with some ( such as the kb_axolotlfor the purpose of kb_biological_reproduction most amphibians require kb_fresh_water kb_water although some lay their kb_eggs_as_food on kb_albanian_land_force and have kb_adaptation various means of keeping them moist . kb_a few ( e.g . `` kb_fejervarya_raja raja '' ) can inhabit kb_brackish_water kb_water , but there are no kb_truth kb_ocean amphibians . there are reports , however , of kb_particular kb_amphibian populations unexpectedly invading kb_ocean waters . such was the case with the kb_black_sea invasion of the kb_natural_number kb_hybrid_(biology) `` kb_pelophylax_esculentus esculentus '' reported in 2010 .several hundred kb_frog kb_species in adaptive radiations ( e.g. , `` kb_eleutherodactylus '' , the kb_pacific_ocean `` kb_platymantis '' , the australo-papuan microhylids , and many kb_other_(philosophy) kb_tropical frogs ) , however , do not need any kb_water for kb_breeding_in_the_wild in the kb_wildlife . they reproduce via direct development , an ecological and evolutionary kb_adaptation that has allowed them to kb_beryllium completely independent from free-standing kb_water . kb_almost_all all of these frogs live in wet kb_tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests and their kb_eggs_as_food hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult , passing through the kb_tadpole stage within the egg . reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the kb_quantity of rainfall , but the seasonal timing .in the tropics , many amphibians kb_breed continuously or at any kb_time_(magazine) of year . in kb_temperate_climate kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey , breeding is mostly seasonal , usually in the kb_castalian_spring , and is triggered by increasing day kb_length , rising temperatures or rainfall . experiments have shown the importance of kb_temperature , but the trigger event , especially in kb_arid kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey , is often kb_a storm . in anurans , males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal kb_greek_chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active .in caecilians , fertilisation is internal , the kb_male extruding an kb_intromittent_organ kb_organ_(music) , the phallodeum , and inserting kb_it into the female kb_cloaca . the paired müllerian glands inside the kb_male kb_cloaca secrete kb_a kb_fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian kb_prostate glands and which may kb_transport and nourish the kb_sperm . fertilisation probably takes kb_place_of_articulation in the kb_oviduct .the majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation . in most of these , the kb_male kb_deposit_(geology) kb_a kb_spermatophore , kb_a small packet of kb_sperm on top of kb_a gelatinous kb_conical_surface , on the kb_substratum either on kb_albanian_land_force or in the kb_water . the female takes up the kb_sperm packet by grasping kb_it with the lips of the kb_cloaca and pushing kb_it into the vent . the spermatozoa move to the kb_spermatheca in the roof of the kb_cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may kb_beryllium many months later . courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the kb_spermatophore vary between kb_species . in some , the kb_spermatophore may kb_beryllium placed directly into the female kb_cloaca while in others , the female may kb_beryllium guided to the kb_spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called kb_amplexus . certain kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) salamanders in the kb_family_(biology) kb_sirenidae , kb_hynobiidae and kb_cryptobranchidae practice kb_external_fertilization fertilisation in kb_a similar manner to frogs , with the female laying the kb_eggs_as_food in kb_water and the kb_male releasing kb_sperm onto the egg kb_mass_(liturgy) .with kb_a few kb_non-linear_writing , frogs use kb_external_fertilization fertilisation . the kb_male grasps the female tightly with kb_histidine forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back kb_human_leg , or in the case of `` kb_epipedobates_tricolor tricolor '' , around the kb_neck . they remain in kb_amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the kb_eggs_as_food and the kb_male kb_cover_version them with kb_sperm . roughened nuptial pads on the kb_male 's hands kb_aid in retaining grip . often the kb_male collects and retains the egg kb_mass_(liturgy) , forming kb_a sort of basket with the hind kb_foot . an exception is the kb_granular_poison_frog kb_poison kb_frog ( `` oophaga granulifera '' ) where the kb_male and female kb_place_of_articulation their cloacae in close kb_principles_of_grouping while facing in kb_phyllotaxis directions and then release kb_eggs_as_food and kb_sperm simultaneously . the kb_tailed_frog kb_frog ( `` ascaphus truei '' ) exhibits internal fertilisation . the `` kb_tail '' is only possessed by the kb_male and is an kb_extension_(kinesiology) of the kb_cloaca and used to inseminate the female . this kb_frog lives in fast-flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the kb_sperm from kb_being washed away before fertilisation occurs . the kb_sperm may kb_beryllium retained in storage tubes attached to the kb_oviductthere is kb_a direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts , with elaborate courtship displays to keep the female 's attention kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) enough to get her interested in choosing him to kb_mating with . some kb_species store kb_sperm through kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) breeding seasons , as the kb_extra_(australian_tv_channel) kb_time_(magazine) may allow for kb_interaction_(statistics) with rival kb_sperm .most amphibians kb_go_(game) through kb_metamorphosis , kb_a process of significant kb_morphology_(linguistics) change after birth . in typical kb_amphibian development , kb_eggs_as_food are laid in kb_water and kb_larvae are adapted to an kb_aquatic_plant kb_lifestyle_(sociology) . frogs , toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as kb_larvae with kb_external_fertilization gills . kb_metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by kb_thyroxine kb_concentration in the blood , which stimulates kb_metamorphosis , and kb_prolactin , which counteracts kb_thyroxine 's effect . specific events are dependent on kb_threshold_potential values for different kb_tissue_(biology) . because most kb_embryogenesis is outside the parental kb_human_body , kb_it is kb_grammatical_subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of kb_tooth , whisker-like kb_skin extensions or kb_fish_fin . they also make use of kb_a kb_sensory_system kb_lateral_line kb_line_(geometry) kb_organ_(music) similar to that of kb_fish . after kb_metamorphosis , these kb_organ_(anatomy) become redundant and kb_will_and_testament kb_beryllium reabsorbed by controlled kb_cell_(biology) kb_death , called kb_apoptosisthe egg of an kb_amphibian is typically surrounded by kb_a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides . this capsule is permeable to kb_water and gases , and swells considerably as kb_it absorbs kb_water . the ovum is at kb_first_trimester rigidly held , but in fertilised kb_eggs_as_food the innermost layer liquefies and allows the kb_embryo to move freely . this also happens in kb_salamander kb_eggs_as_food , even when they are unfertilised . kb_eggs_as_food of some salamanders and frogs contain kb_unicellular_organism kb_green_algae . these penetrate the jelly kb_envelope_(waves) after the kb_eggs_as_food are laid and may increase the supply of kb_oxygen to the kb_embryo through kb_photosynthesis . they seem to both speed up the development of the kb_larvae and reduce mortality . most kb_eggs_as_food contain the kb_pigment kb_melanin which raises their kb_temperature through the absorption of kb_light and also protects them against kb_ultraviolet_radiation . caecilians , some kb_plethodontidae and certain frogs lay kb_eggs_as_food underground that are unpigmented . in the kb_wood_frog ( `` rana sylvatica '' ) , the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to kb_beryllium up to warmer than its surroundings , which is an advantage in its cool kb_northern_hemisphere kb_habitat .the kb_eggs_as_food may kb_beryllium

kb_water and hatch into free-living kb_larvae that complete their development in kb_water and later transform into either kb_aquatic_plant or kb_terrestrial_animal adults . in many kb_species of kb_frog and in most lungless salamanders ( kb_plethodontidae ) , direct development takes kb_place_of_articulation , the kb_larvae growing within the kb_eggs_as_food and emerging as miniature adults . many caecilians and some kb_other_(philosophy) amphibians lay their kb_eggs_as_food on kb_albanian_land_force , and the newly hatched kb_larvae wriggle or are transported to kb_water bodies . some

kb_other_(philosophy) amphibians , but not caecilians , are kb_ovoviviparous . the kb_eggs_as_food are retained in or on the parent 's kb_human_body , but the kb_larvae subsist on the yolks of their kb_eggs_as_food and receive no nourishment from the adult . the kb_larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth , either before or after kb_metamorphosis , according to their kb_species . the toad kb_genus `` nectophrynoides '' exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or kb_sulfate members .kb_frog kb_larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , kb_vertical_direction flattened tails with kb_fish_fin . the free-living kb_larvae are normally fully kb_aquatic_plant , but the tadpoles of some kb_species ( such as `` kb_nannophrys_ceylonensis ceylonensis '' ) are semi-terrestrial and live among wet kb_rock_(geology) . tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons , gills for respiration (

kb_neoteny occurs when the kb_animal 's growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low kb_water temperatures that may change the response of the kb_tissue_(biology) to

.kb_alaska 's kb_economy_of_alaska depends heavily on increasingly expensive kb_diesel_engine kb_fuel for heating , kb_transportation , electric kb_power_(physics) and kb_light . although kb_wind and kb_hydroelectricity kb_power_(physics) are abundant and underdeveloped , proposals for statewide kb_energy_industry kb_systems_analysis ( e.g . with special kb_single-wire_earth_return#use_in_interties electric interties ) were judged uneconomical ( at the kb_time_(magazine) of the report , 2001 ) due to low ( less than 50¢/gal ) kb_fuel prices , kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) distances and low kb_population . the cost of kb_a gallon of kb_gas in kb_urban_area kb_alaska today is usually 30–60¢ higher than the national average ; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on kb_transportation costs , seasonal usage peaks , nearby kb_petroleum development kb_infrastructure and many kb_other_(philosophy) factors .the kb_alaska_permanent_fund fund is kb_a constitutionally authorized appropriation of kb_palm_oil revenues , established by voters in kb_1976_winter_olympics to manage kb_a surplus in kb_state_of_matter kb_petroleum revenues from kb_palm_oil , largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed kb_trans-alaska_pipeline_system pipeline system . the fund was originally kb_anatolian_hypothesis by kb_governor_(united_states) kb_keith_harvey_miller miller on the kb_eve of the 1969 prudhoe bay lease sale , out of kb_fear that the kb_alabama_legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale ( which amounted to kb_usd 900 million ) at once . kb_it was later championed by kb_governor_(united_states) kb_jay_hammond hammond and kb_kenai,_alaska kb_alaska_house_of_representatives hugh malone . kb_it has served as an attractive kb_politics prospect ever since , diverting revenues which would normally kb_beryllium deposited into the kb_general_(united_states) fund .the kb_alaska_constitution was written kb_sulfate as to discourage dedicating kb_state_of_matter funds for kb_a kb_particular purpose . the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this , mostly due to the kb_politics kb_climate_of_albania of distrust existing during the kb_time_(magazine) of its creation . from its initial principal of kb_usd 734,000 , the fund has grown to kb_usd 50 kb_billion as kb_a result of kb_palm_oil royalties and kb_list_of_australian_capital_cities investment programs . most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside kb_alaska . this has kb_light-emitting_diode to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within kb_alaska , though such kb_a stance has never gained kb_momentum .starting in kb_1982_world_rally_championship_season , dividends from the fund 's kb_annual_plant growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans , ranging from an initial kb_usd 1,000 in kb_1982_world_rally_championship_season ( equal to kb_triliteral years ' payout , as the distribution of payments was held up in kb_a lawsuit over the distribution scheme ) to kb_usd 3,269 in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 ( which included kb_a one-time kb_usd 1,200 `` resource rebate '' ) . every year , the kb_state_of_matter kb_alabama_legislature takes out kb_group_8_element % from the earnings , puts 3 % back into the principal for kb_inflation proofing , and the remaining 5 % is distributed to all qualifying alaskans . to qualify for the permanent fund kb_dividend , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) must have lived in the kb_state_of_matter for kb_a kb_minimum of 12 months , maintain constant residency kb_grammatical_subject to allowable absences , and not kb_beryllium kb_grammatical_subject to kb_court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying kb_biological_classification or may kb_grammatical_subject the payment amount to civil garnishment .the permanent fund is often considered to kb_beryllium kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the leading examples of kb_a `` kb_basic_income '' policy in the kb_world .the cost of

the short 100-day kb_growing_season kb_season limits the crops that can kb_beryllium grown , but the kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons . the

, small farms and farmers ' kb_market_(economics) in recent years , with the highest percentage increase ( 46 % ) in kb_the_nation nation in growth in farmers ' kb_market_(economics) in 2011 , compared to 17 % nationwide . the kb_peony kb_industry has also taken off , as the kb_growing_season kb_season allows farmers to kb_harvest during kb_a gap in supply elsewhere in the kb_world , thereby filling kb_a niche in the kb_flower market .kb_alaska , with no kb_county_(united_states) , lacks county fairs . however , kb_a small assortment of kb_state_of_matter and local fairs ( with the kb_alaska_state_fair fair in kb_palmer,_alaska the kb_largest_organisms ) , are held mostly in the late summer . the fairs are mostly located in communities with kb_historic_site or kb_electric_current kb_agriculture activity , and kb_i_shot_andy_warhol local farmers exhibiting produce in kb_addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as kb_carnival rides , concerts and kb_food_industry . `` kb_alaska grown '' is used as an kb_agriculture slogan .kb_alaska has an kb_abundance_of_the_chemical_elements of kb_seafood , with the kb_primary_education fisheries in the kb_bering_sea kb_sea_(astronomy) and the kb_north kb_pacific_ocean . kb_seafood is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the few kb_food_industry items that is often cheaper within the kb_state_of_matter than outside kb_it . many alaskans kb_take advantage of kb_salmon seasons to kb_harvest portions of their kb_household kb_diet_(nutrition) while kb_fishing for subsistence , as kb_water_well as kb_sport . this includes kb_fish taken by hook , net or kb_wheel .hunting for subsistence , primarily kb_caribou , kb_moose , and kb_dall_sheep kb_sheep is still common in the kb_state_of_matter , particularly in remote kb_the_bush_(alaska) communities . an example of kb_a traditional native kb_food_industry is kb_akutaq , the eskimo kb_ice_cream , which can consist of reindeer kb_fat , kb_seal_(emblem) kb_palm_oil , dried kb_fish kb_meat and local berries .kb_alaska 's reindeer herding is concentrated on kb_seward_peninsula , where kb_wildlife kb_caribou can kb_beryllium prevented

with spurs to kb_whittier,_alaska , kb_palmer,_alaska and kb_north_pole . the cities , towns , villages , and kb_region served by arr tracks are known statewide as `` the railbelt '' . in recent years , the ever-improving kb_road_surface highway system began to kb_eclipse the railroad 's importance in kb_alaska 's kb_economy_of_alaska .the railroad played kb_a vital role in kb_alaska 's development , moving kb_cargo into kb_alaska while transporting kb_natural_resources southward ( i.e. , kb_coal from the usibelli kb_coal mine near kb_healy,_alaska to kb_seward,_alaska and kb_gravel from the kb_matanuska_valley kb_valley to kb_anchorage,_alaska ) . kb_it is kb_water_well known for its summertime tour passenger service .the kb_alaska_railroad was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the last railroads in kb_north_america to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some kb_gravel trains . kb_it continues to offer kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the last kb_request_stop routes in the kb_country_music . kb_a stretch of about of track along an kb_area kb_north of kb_talkeetna,_alaska remains inaccessible by road ; the railroad provides the only kb_transportation to rural homes and cabins in the kb_area . until kb_construction of the parks highway in the 1970s , the railroad provided the only kb_albanian_land_force access to most of the kb_region along its entire route .in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_southeast_alaska , the kb_white_pass_and_yukon_route and kb_yukon route also partly runs through the kb_state_of_matter from kb_skagway,_alaska northwards into kb_canada ( kb_british_columbia and kb_yukon ) , crossing the kb_border_crossings_of_albania at kb_white_american pass summit . this kb_line_(geometry) is now mainly used by tourists , often arriving

kb_kodiak_island_borough,_alaskathe bulk of remaining commercial kb_flight offerings come from small kb_regional_power commuter airlines such as kb_ravn_alaska kb_alaska , kb_penair , and kb_frontier_flying_service service . the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered kb_the_bush_(alaska) flying kb_service_(economics) using kb_general_aviation kb_aircraft such as the kb_cessna_caravan caravan , the most popular kb_aircraft in use in the kb_state_of_matter . much of this service can kb_beryllium attributed to the kb_alaska bypass kb_airmail kb_program_(computing) which subsidizes bulk kb_airmail kb_childbirth to alaskan rural communities . the kb_program_(computing) requires 70 % of that kb_subsidy to kb_goto_(command) carriers kb_world_health_organization offer passenger service to the communities .many communities have small kb_air_(classical_element) taxi kb_service_(economics) . these operations originated from the demand for customized kb_transport to remote areas . perhaps the most quintessentially alaskan kb_plane_(geometry) is kb_the_bush_(alaska) kb_the_bush_(alaska) kb_seaplane . the kb_world 's busiest kb_seaplane kb_base_(chemistry) is kb_lake_hood_seaplane_base , located kb_next to kb_ted_stevens_anchorage_international_airport stevens kb_anchorage,_alaska international kb_airport , where flights

kb_technology permits innovations like kb_conservation_tillagesince the kb_1940s , kb_agricultural_productivity has increased dramatically , due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive kb_mechanized_farming , kb_fertilizers and kb_pesticides . the vast majority of this kb_energy_industry input comes from kb_fossil_fuel sources . between the kb_1960s_in_the_united_states and the 1980s , the kb_green_revolution transformed kb_agriculture around kb_the_globe_(toronto_newspaper) globe , with kb_world kb_cereal production increasing significantly ( between 70 % and 390 % for kb_wheat and 60 % to 150 % for kb_rice , depending on geographic kb_area ) as kb_world_population doubled . heavy reliance on kb_petrochemicals has raised concerns that kb_palm_oil shortages could increase costs and reduce kb_agriculture output .industrialized kb_agriculture depends on kb_fossil fuels in kb_2_(number) fundamental ways : direct consumption on the kb_farm and manufacture of inputs used on the kb_farm . direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate kb_farm vehicles and kb_machinery .indirect consumption includes the manufacture of kb_fertilizers , kb_pesticides , and kb_farm kb_machinery . in kb_particular , the production of kb_nitrogen_fertilizer can account for over half of kb_agriculture kb_energy_industry usage . together , direct and indirect consumption by kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) farms accounts for about kb_alkaline_earth_metal % of kb_the_nation nation 's kb_energy_industry use . direct and indirect kb_energy_industry consumption by kb_usa_davis_cup_team farms peaked in 1979 , and has since gradually declined . kb_food_systems encompass not just kb_agriculture but off-farm kb_fish_processing , packaging , transporting , marketing , consumption , and disposal of kb_food_industry and food-related items . kb_agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of kb_food_industry system kb_energy_industry use in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) .kb_agriculture kb_economics refers to kb_economics as kb_it relates to the `` production , distribution and consumption of [ kb_agriculture ] goods and kb_service_(economics) '' . combining kb_agricultural_sector with kb_general_(united_states) kb_theories of marketing and kb_business as kb_a discipline of kb_science began in the late 1800s , and grew significantly through the 20th century . although the kb_science of kb_agriculture kb_economics is relatively recent , kb_major_(united_states) trends in kb_agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout kb_history , ranging from tenant farmers and kb_sharecropping in the post-american kb_american_civil_war kb_war kb_southern_united_states kb_sovereign_state to the kb_european_eel kb_feudal system of kb_manorialism . in the united kb_sovereign_state , and elsewhere , kb_food_industry costs attributed to kb_food_processing , distribution , and kb_agricultural_marketing , sometimes referred to as the kb_agricultural_value_chain , have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined . this is related to the greater kb_efficiency of farming , combined with the increased level of kb_value_added ( e.g . more highly processed products ) provided by the supply chain . kb_market_concentration kb_concentration has increased in the sector as kb_water_well , and although the total effect of the increased kb_market_concentration kb_concentration is likely increased kb_efficiency , the changes

kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_taxation , kb_subsidy , tariffs and kb_other_(philosophy) measures . since at least the kb_1960s_in_the_united_states , kb_a combination of kb_trade restrictions , kb_exchange_rate_policy rate policies and kb_subsidy have affected farmers in both the developing and the kb_developed_world . in the 1980s , non-subsidized farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low kb_globalization prices for kb_farm products . between the mid-1980s and the early kb_2000s_in_angola , several international agreements limited kb_agriculture tariffs , kb_subsidy and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_trade restrictions .however , , there was still kb_a significant amount of policy-driven kb_distortion in kb_globalization kb_agriculture kb_decay_product prices . the kb_triliteral kb_agriculture products with the greatest amount of kb_trade kb_distortion were kb_sugar , kb_milk and kb_rice , mainly due to kb_taxation . among the oilseedskb_agricultural_science is kb_a broad multidisciplinary field of kb_biology that encompasses the parts of exact , kb_natural_number ,

adverse kb_environmental_awareness effects such as kb_soil_retrogression_and_degradation , kb_waste_management kb_management , and kb_bioremediation .the kb_scientific_method kb_science of kb_agriculture began in the kb_18th_century century , when kb_johann_friedrich_mayer_(agriculturist) friedrich mayer conducted experiments on the use of kb_gypsum ( hydrated kb_calcium_sulphate ) as kb_a kb_fertilizer . kb_research became more kb_iupac_nomenclature when in 1843 , kb_john_lawes and kb_henry_gilbert gilbert began kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of long-term kb_agronomy field experiments at

kb_hatch_act_of_1887 act of 1887 provided funding for what kb_it was the kb_first_trimester to call `` kb_agricultural_science '' , driven by farmers ' kb_interest in kb_fertilizers . in kb_agriculture kb_entomology , the kb_united_states_department_of_agriculture began to kb_research kb_biology control in 1881 ; kb_it instituted its kb_first_trimester kb_prespa_lake kb_program_(computing) in 1905 , searching kb_europe and kb_japan for kb_natural_number enemies of the kb_lymantria_dispar_dispar and kb_brown-tail kb_moth , establishing parasitoids ( such as solitary wasps ) and kb_predation of both pests in the usa .kb_agricultural_policy is the kb_set_(mythology) of kb_forms_of_government decisions and kb_orthopraxy relating to domestic kb_agriculture and imports of foreign kb_agriculture products . governments usually implement kb_agriculture policies with the goal of achieving kb_a specific outcome in the domestic kb_agriculture kb_decay_product kb_market_(economics) . some overarching themes include kb_risk kb_management and adjustment ( including policies related to kb_climate_change , kb_food_safety and kb_natural_number disasters ) , kb_economic_stability ( including policies related to taxes ) , kb_natural_resources and environmental kb_sustainability ( especially kb_water_resource_management ) , kb_research_and_development development , and market access for domestic commodities ( including kb_foreign_relations_of_albania with kb_globalization organizations and agreements with kb_other_(philosophy) countries ) . kb_agricultural_policy can also touch on kb_food_quality , ensuring that the kb_food_industry supply is of kb_a kb_consistent and known quality , kb_food_security , ensuring that the kb_food_industry supply meets the kb_population 's needs , and kb_conservation_biology . policy programs can range from financial programs , such as kb_subsidy , to encouraging producers to enroll in kb_pledge_of_allegiance_(united_states)#legal_challenges quality assurance programs .there are many influences on the creation of kb_agricultural_policy , including consumers , kb_agribusiness , kb_trade lobbies and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_group_(mathematics) . kb_agribusiness interests hold kb_a kb_prespa_lake amount of influence over policy making , in the

'' in kb_histidine kb_letter_(alphabet) to orwell , kb_he_(letter) predicted :kb_thomas_henry_huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the kb_developed_world might make for itself . from these , kb_he_(letter) made some warnings in kb_histidine writings and talks . in kb_a 1958 televised kb_interview_(magazine) conducted by journalist kb_mike_wallace wallace , kb_thomas_henry_huxley outlined several kb_major_(united_states) concerns : the difficulties and dangers of kb_world overpopulation ; the tendency toward distinctly kb_hierarchical kb_social_anarchism organisation ; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of kb_technology in kb_mass_(liturgy) kb_society susceptible to persuasion ; the tendency to promote kb_modern_history politicians to kb_a naive kb_state_school as well-marketed commodities .in 1953 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley and maria kb_applied_science for kb_citizenship_in_the_united_states kb_sovereign_state citizenship and presented themselves for kb_hypothesis . when kb_thomas_henry_huxley refused to kb_bear arms for the kb_usa_davis_cup_team and would not kb_state_of_matter that kb_histidine objections were based on kb_religion ideals , the only excuse allowed under the kb_mccarran_internal_security_act act , the judge had to adjourn the proceedings . kb_he_(letter) withdrew kb_histidine kb_application_(computing) . nevertheless , kb_he_(letter) remained in the kb_usa_davis_cup_team in 1959 kb_thomas_henry_huxley turned down an offer of kb_a kb_knight_bachelor kb_bachelor's_degree by the kb_harold_macmillan#prime_minister_(1957–1963) kb_forms_of_government without putting forward kb_a kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving ; kb_histidine brother kb_julian_(emperor) had been kb_kbe in 1958 , while another brother andrew would kb_beryllium kb_kbe in 1974 .beginning in 1939 and continuing until kb_death_of_alexander_the_great in 1963 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley had an extensive kb_continental_association with the kb_vedanta_society_of_southern_california of kb_southern_europe kb_california , founded and headed by kb_swami_prabhavananda . together with kb_gerald_heard heard , kb_christopher_isherwood isherwood and kb_other_(philosophy) followers , kb_he_(letter) was initiated by the kb_swami and was taught kb_meditation and kb_spirituality practices .in 1944 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley wrote the introduction to the `` kb_bhagavad_gita gita : the song of kb_god '' , translated by kb_swami_prabhavananda and kb_christopher_isherwood isherwood , which was published by the kb_vedanta_society_of_southern_california of kb_southern_europe kb_california .from 1941 until kb_u.s._presidential_election,_1960 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley contributed 48 kb_article_(grammar) to `` kb_vedanta and the kb_western_culture '' , published by the society . kb_he_(letter) also served on the editorial board with isherwood , heard , and kb_playwright kb_john_van_druten druten from kb_1951_in_literature through 1962 .kb_thomas_henry_huxley also occasionally lectured at the kb_hollywood and santa kb_barbara_branden kb_vedanta kb_egyptian_temple . kb_2_(number) of those lectures have been released on cd : `` kb_knowledge_and_understanding understanding '' and `` kb_world_health_organization are we ? '' from 1955. nonetheless , kb_thomas_henry_huxley 's agnosticism , together with kb_histidine speculative propensity , made kb_it difficult for him to fully embrace any kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of institutionalised kb_religion .in the kb_castalian_spring of 1953 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley had kb_histidine kb_first_trimester experience with the kb_psychedelic_drug drug kb_mescaline . kb_thomas_henry_huxley had initiated kb_a correspondence with kb_physician kb_humphry_osmond osmond , kb_a kb_kingdom_of_great_britain kb_psychiatrist then employed in kb_a kb_canadians institution , and eventually asked him to supply kb_a dose of kb_mescaline ; osmond obliged and kb_supervised_learning kb_thomas_henry_huxley 's session in kb_southern_europe kb_california . after the publication of `` kb_the_doors_of_perception of kb_machine_perception '' , in which kb_he_(letter) recounted this experience , kb_thomas_henry_huxley and kb_swami_prabhavananda disagreed about the kb_meaning_(linguistics) and importance of the kb_psychedelic_drug drug experience , which may have caused the relationship to cool , but kb_thomas_henry_huxley continued to write kb_article_(grammar) for the society 's kb_academic_journal , lecture at the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina , and attend kb_social_anarchism functions . kb_thomas_henry_huxley later had an kb_the_doors_of_perception#later_experience on kb_lysergic_acid_diethylamide that kb_he_(letter) considered more profound than those detailed in kb_the_doors_of_perception of kb_machine_perception .kb_thomas_henry_huxley wrote that `` '' the kb_religious_experience is doubly valuable ; kb_it is valuable because kb_it gives the experiencer kb_a better understanding of himself and the kb_world and because kb_it may help him to kb_lead kb_a less self-centered and more kb_creativity kb_life_(magazine) . '' ''differing accounts exist about the details of the quality of kb_thomas_henry_huxley 's kb_eyesight at specific points in kb_histidine kb_life_(magazine) . in about 1939 kb_thomas_henry_huxley encountered the kb_bates_method for better kb_eyesight , and kb_a teacher , kb_margaret_darst_corbett darst corbett , kb_world_health_organization was able to teach the method to him . in 1940 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley kb_baltimore_colts_relocation_to_indianapolis from kb_hollywood to kb_a `` ranchito '' in the kb_high_middle_ages kb_desert kb_hamlet of llano , kb_california , in kb_northern_hemisphere los angeles county . kb_thomas_henry_huxley then said that kb_histidine sight improved dramatically with the kb_bates_method and the extreme and pure kb_natural_number lighting of the southwestern kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) kb_desert . kb_he_(letter) reported that , for the kb_first_trimester kb_time_(magazine) in more than 25 years , kb_he_(letter) was able to kb_walter_read without glasses and without kb_strain_(biology) . kb_he_(letter) even tried driving kb_a kb_car along the dirt road beside the kb_ranch . kb_he_(letter) wrote kb_a book about kb_histidine successes with the kb_bates_method , `` kb_the_art_of_seeing kb_art of seeing '' , which was published in 1942 ( kb_usa_davis_cup_team ) , 1943 ( kb_united_kingdom ) . the book contained some generally disputed kb_theories , and its publication created kb_a growing kb_degree_(angle) of popular kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war about kb_thomas_henry_huxley 's kb_eyesight .kb_it was , and is , widely believed that kb_thomas_henry_huxley was nearly kb_blindness since the illness in kb_histidine teens , despite the kb_partial_order recovery that had enabled him to kb_science at kb_oxford . for example , some ten years after publication of `` kb_the_art_of_seeing kb_art of seeing '' , in 1952 , kb_bennett_cerf cerf was present when kb_thomas_henry_huxley spoke at kb_a kb_hollywood banquet , wearing no glasses and apparently kb_reading_abbey kb_histidine paper from the lectern without difficulty : `` then suddenly kb_he_(letter) faltered—and the disturbing kb_truth became obvious . kb_he_(letter) was n't kb_reading_abbey kb_histidine address at all . kb_he_(letter) had learned kb_it by kb_heart . to refresh kb_histidine kb_memory kb_he_(letter) brought the paper closer and closer to kb_histidine eyes . when kb_it was only an kb_inch or kb_sulfate away kb_he_(letter) still could n't kb_walter_read kb_it , and had to kb_fish for kb_a magnifying kb_glass in kb_histidine pocket to make the typing visible to him . kb_it was an agonising moment .

kb_algae have become heterotrophs ( also called colorless or apochlorotic kb_algae ) , sometimes kb_parasitic , relying entirely on kb_external_fertilization kb_energy_industry sources and have

in kb_australian_english . the kb_etymology is obscure . although some speculate that kb_it is related to kb_latin `` algēre '' , `` kb_beryllium cold '' , no kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving is known to associate kb_seaweed with kb_temperature . kb_a more likely source is `` alliga '' , `` binding , entwining '' .the kb_ancient_greek word for kb_seaweed was φῦκος ( `` phŷcos '' ) , which could kb_mean either the kb_seaweed ( probably kb_red_fox kb_algae ) or kb_a kb_red_fox kb_dye kb_derived_trait from kb_it . the kb_latinisation_of_names , `` fūcus '' , meant primarily the

based on kb_plastidkb_carl_linnaeus , in `` kb_species_plantarum '' ( 1753 ) , the starting point for kb_modern_history kb_botanical_nomenclature nomenclature , recognized 14 kb_genus of kb_algae , of which only four are currently considered among kb_algae . in `` kb_10th_edition_of_systema_naturae naturae '' , kb_carl_linnaeus described the kb_genus `` kb_volvox '' and `` kb_corallina '' , and kb_a kb_species of `` kb_acetabularia '' ( as `` kb_madrepora '' ) , among the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing .in 1768 , kb_samuel_gottlieb_gmelin gmelin ( 1744–1774 ) published the `` historia fucorum '' , the kb_first_trimester kb_cold_working dedicated to kb_ocean kb_algae and the kb_first_trimester book on kb_marine_biology to use the then kb_new_world binomial nomenclature of kb_carl_linnaeus . kb_it included elaborate illustrations of kb_seaweed and kb_ocean kb_algae on folded kb_leaf .kb_w.h.harvey ( 1811–1866 ) and kb_lamouroux ( 1813 ) were the kb_first_trimester to divide kb_macroscopic_scale kb_algae into four kb_division_(sport) based on their pigmentation . this is the kb_first_trimester use of kb_a biochemical criterion in kb_plant systematics . harvey 's four kb_division_(sport) are : kb_red_fox kb_algae ( rhodospermae ) , kb_robert_brown_(scottish_botanist_from_montrose) kb_algae ( melanospermae ) , kb_green_algae ( chlorospermae ) , and diatomaceae .at this kb_time_(magazine) , kb_microscopic_scale kb_algae were discovered and reported by kb_a different kb_group_(periodic_table) of workers ( e.g. , kb_otto_friedrich_müller f. müller and kb_christian_gottfried_ehrenberg ) studying the kb_infusoria ( kb_microscopic_scale organisms ) . unlike kb_macroalgae , which were clearly viewed as plants , kb_microalgae were frequently considered kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing because they are often kb_motility . even the nonmotile ( coccoid ) kb_microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the kb_biological_life_cycle of plants , kb_macroalgae , or kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing .although used as kb_a kb_taxonomy_(general) category in some pre-darwinian kb_biological_classification , e.g. , kb_carl_linnaeus ( 1753 ) , kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann jussieu ( 1789 ) , horaninow ( 1843 ) , agassiz ( 1859 ) , wilson & cassin ( 1864 ) , in further kb_biological_classification , the `` kb_algae '' are seen as an artificial , kb_polyphyletic kb_group_(periodic_table) .throughout the 20th century , most kb_biological_classification treated the following kb_group_(mathematics) as kb_division_(sport) or classes of kb_algae : cyanophytes , rhodophytes , chrysophytes , xanthophytes , kb_diatom , phaeophytes , kb_dinoflagellate#history ( kb_cryptomonad and dinophytes ) , euglenophytes , and kb_chlorophyta . later , many kb_new_world kb_group_(mathematics) were discovered ( e.g. , kb_bolidophyceae ) , and others were splintered from older kb_group_(mathematics) : charophytes and glaucophytes ( from kb_chlorophyta ) , many heterokontophytes ( e.g. , kb_synurophyceae from chrysophytes , or eustigmatophytes from xanthophytes ) , haptophytes ( from chrysophytes ) , and chlorarachniophytes ( from xanthophytes ) .with the abandonment of plant-animal dichotomous kb_statistical_classification , most kb_group_(mathematics) of kb_algae ( sometimes all ) were included in protista , later also abandoned in favour of kb_eukaryota . however , as kb_a legacy of the older kb_plant kb_life_(magazine) scheme , some kb_group_(mathematics) that were also treated as protozoans in the kb_past still have duplicated kb_biological_classification ( kb_episcopal_see ambiregnal protists ) .some kb_parasitic kb_algae ( e.g. , the kb_green_algae `` kb_prototheca '' and `` kb_helicosporidium '' , kb_parasites of metazoans , or `` kb_cephaleuros '' , kb_parasites of plants ) were originally classified as kb_fungi , sporozoans , or protistans of `` kb_incertae_sedis sedis '' , while others ( e.g. , the kb_green_algae `` kb_phyllosiphon '' and `` kb_rhodochytrium '' , kb_parasites of plants , or the kb_red_fox kb_algae `` kb_pterocladiophila '' and `` kb_gelidiocolax_mammillatus mammillatus '' , kb_parasites of kb_other_(philosophy) kb_red_fox kb_algae , or the dinoflagellates `` kb_oodinium '' , kb_parasites of kb_fish ) had their relationship with kb_algae conjectured early . in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_noun_case , some kb_group_(mathematics) were originally characterized as kb_parasitic kb_algae ( e.g. , `` kb_chlorochytrium '' ) , but later were seen as kb_endophytic kb_algae . some filamentous kb_bacteria ( e.g. , `` kb_beggiatoa '' ) were originally seen as kb_algae . furthermore , kb_group_(mathematics) like the kb_apicomplexans are also kb_parasites kb_derived_trait from ancestors that possessed plastids , but are not included in any kb_group_(periodic_table) traditionally seen as kb_algae .the kb_first_trimester kb_embryophyte probably

kb_group_(mathematics) to exhibit three-dimensional kb_multicellular kb_thallus are the kb_red_algae and kb_brown_algae , and some kb_chlorophyta . apical growth is constrained to subsets of these kb_group_(mathematics) : the kb_florideophyceae kb_red_algae , various kb_brown_algae , and the charophytes . the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of charophytes is quite different from those of kb_red_algae and kb_brown_algae , because they have distinct nodes , separated by internode 'stems ' ; whorls of kb_branches_of_science reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes . conceptacles are another kb_polyphyletic kb_trait_theory ; they appear in the kb_coralline_algae kb_algae and the kb_hildenbrandiales , as kb_water_well as the kb_brown_algae .most of the simpler kb_algae are kb_unicellular_organism flagellates or amoeboids , but kb_colonialism and nonmotile kb_theory_of_forms have kb_adaptation independently among several of the kb_group_(mathematics) . some of the more common organizational levels , more than kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of which may occur in the kb_biological_life_cycle of kb_a kb_species , arein kb_triliteral lines , even higher levels of organization have been reached , with full kb_tissue_(biology) kb_planetary_differentiation . these are the kb_robert_brown_(scottish_botanist_from_montrose) kb_algae , —some of which may reach 50 kb_mole_(unit) in kb_length ( kelps ) —the kb_red_fox kb_algae , and the kb_green_algae . the most kb_complex_number kb_theory_of_forms are found among the kb_charophyte kb_algae ( kb_episcopal_see kb_charales and kb_charophyta ) , in kb_a lineage that eventually kb_light-emitting_diode to the higher kb_embryophyte . the kb_list_of_azerbaijani_inventions_and_discoveries that defines these nonalgal plants is the presence of female reproductive kb_organ_(anatomy) with protective kb_cell_(biology) layers that protect the kb_zygote and developing kb_embryo . hence , the kb_embryophyte are referred to as the embryophytes .many kb_algae , particularly members of the kb_characeae , have served as kb_rutherford_model experimental organisms to kb_natural_language_understanding the mechanisms of the kb_water permeability of membranes , kb_osmoregulation , kb_turgor_regulation regulation , kb_salt_tolerance , kb_cytoplasmic_streaming streaming , and the generation of

kb_evolutionary_biology biologist kb_ronald_fisher fisher . in the anova setting , the observed kb_variance in kb_a kb_particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation . in its simplest kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , anova provides kb_a kb_statistical_test of whether the kb_population means of several kb_group_(mathematics) are equal , and therefore generalizes the `` t '' -test to more than kb_2_(number) kb_group_(mathematics) . anova is useful for comparing ( testing ) kb_triliteral or more kb_group_(periodic_table) means for kb_statistical_significance . kb_it is conceptually similar to kb_multiple_comparisons_problem t-tests , but is more kb_conservative , resulting in fewer kb_type_i_errors kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics , and is therefore suited to kb_a wide range of practical kb_problems_(aristotle) .while the kb_analysis of kb_variance reached fruition in the 20th century , antecedents extend kb_century_(cricket) into the kb_past according to stigler . these include hypothesis testing , the partitioning of sums of kb_square_(algebra) , experimental techniques and the additive kb_rutherford_model . kb_laplace was performing hypothesis testing in the 1770s . the development of least-squares methods by kb_laplace and kb_carl_friedrich_gauss circa 1800 provided an improved method of combining kb_observations_(pierre_belon) ( over the existing practices then used in kb_astronomy and geodesy ) . kb_it also initiated much kb_science of the contributions to sums of kb_square_(algebra) . kb_laplace knew how to estimate kb_a kb_variance from kb_a residual ( rather than kb_a total ) kb_sum_of_squares_(statistics) kb_square_(algebra) . by 1827 , kb_laplace was using kb_least_squares kb_square_(algebra) methods to address anova kb_problems_(aristotle) regarding measurements of atmospheric tides . before 1800 , astronomers had kb_isolationism kb_observational_astronomy kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics resultingfrom reaction times ( the `` kb_personal_equation '' ) and had kb_adaptation methods of kb_redox the kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics . the experimental methods used in the kb_science of the kb_personal_equation were later kb_acceptance#self_acceptance by the emerging field of kb_psychology which kb_adaptation kb_strong_nuclear_force ( full kb_factorial_experiment ) experimental methods to which randomization and kb_blind_experiment were soon added . an eloquent non-mathematical explanation of the additive effects kb_rutherford_model waskb_one-way_analysis_of_variance in 1885 .kb_ronald_fisher fisher introduced the kb_terminology kb_variance and kb_anatolian_hypothesis its formal kb_analysis in kb_a 1918 article `` kb_the_correlation_between_relatives_on_the_supposition_of_mendelian_inheritance correlation between relatives on the supposition of kb_mendelian inheritance '' . kb_histidine kb_first_trimester kb_application_(computing) of the kb_analysis of kb_variance was published in 1921. kb_analysis of kb_variance became widely known after kb_being included in fisher 's 1925 book `` kb_statistical_methods_for_research_workers kb_research workers '' .randomization models were kb_adaptation by several researchers . the kb_first_trimester was published in kb_poland by kb_jerzy_neyman neyman kb_analysis of kb_variance can kb_beryllium used as an exploratory kb_tool to explain kb_observations_(pierre_belon) . kb_a kb_dog show provides an example . kb_a kb_dog show is not kb_a random sampling of the kb_breed : kb_it is typically limited to dogs that are adult , pure-bred , and exemplary . kb_a histogram of kb_dog weights from kb_a show might plausibly kb_beryllium rather kb_complex_number , like the yellow-orange distribution shown in the illustrations . suppose we wanted to predict the weight of kb_a kb_dog based on kb_a certain kb_set_(mythology) of characteristics of each kb_dog . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) way to do that is to `` explain '' the distribution of weights by dividing the kb_dog kb_population into kb_group_(mathematics) based on those characteristics . kb_a successful grouping kb_will_and_testament split dogs such that ( kb_a ) each kb_group_(periodic_table) has kb_a low kb_variance of kb_dog weights ( kb_meaning_(linguistics) the kb_group_(periodic_table) is relatively homogeneous ) and ( kb_riboflavin ) the kb_mean of each kb_group_(periodic_table) is distinct ( if kb_2_(number) kb_group_(mathematics) have the same kb_mean , then kb_it is n't reasonable to conclude that the kb_group_(mathematics) are , in kb_fact , separate in any meaningful way ) .in the illustrations to the kb_right-wing_politics , kb_group_(mathematics) are kb_interpretatio_graeca as `` x '' , `` x '' , etc . in the kb_first_trimester illustration , the dogs are divided according to the kb_decay_product ( kb_interaction ) of kb_2_(number) kb_binary_number groupings : kb_thomas_young_(scientist) vs kb_old_testament , and short-haired vs long-haired ( e.g. , kb_group_(periodic_table) 1 is kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , short-haired dogs , kb_group_(periodic_table) kb_alkaline_earth_metal is kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , long-haired dogs , etc. ) . since the distributions of kb_dog weight within each of the kb_group_(mathematics) ( shown in blue ) has kb_a relatively kb_prespa_lake kb_variance , and since the means are very similar across kb_group_(mathematics) , grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in kb_dog weights : knowing which kb_group_(periodic_table) kb_a kb_dog is in does n't allow kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) to predict its weight much better than simply knowing the kb_dog is in kb_a kb_dog show . thus , this grouping fails to explain the variation in the overall distribution ( yellow-orange ) .an attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as `` pet vs working kb_breed '' and `` less athletic vs more athletic '' would probably kb_beryllium somewhat more successful ( fair fit ) . the heaviest show dogs are likely to kb_beryllium big , kb_strong_nuclear_force , working breeds , while breeds kept as pets tend to kb_beryllium smaller and thus lighter . as shown by the kb_second illustration , the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the kb_first_trimester case , and the means are more distinguishable . however , the significant overlap of distributions , for example , means that we can not distinguish `` x '' and `` x '' reliably . grouping dogs according to kb_a kb_coin flip might produce distributions that kb_look_(american_magazine) similar .an attempt to explain weight by kb_breed is likely to produce kb_a very good fit . all chihuahuas are kb_light and all st bernards are heavy . the difference in weights between setters and kb_pointer_(computer_programming) does not justify separate breeds . the kb_analysis of kb_variance provides the formal tools to justify these kb_intuition_(knowledge) judgments . kb_a common use of the method is the kb_analysis of experimental kb_big_data or the development of models . the method has some advantages over correlation : not all of the kb_big_data must kb_beryllium numeric and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) result of the method is kb_a kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition in the kb_confidence_and_supply in an explanatory relationship .anova is kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_statistical_hypothesis_testing testing heavily used in the kb_analysis of experimental kb_big_data . kb_a test result ( calculated from the kb_null_hypothesis and the kb_sample_(statistics) ) is called kb_statistical_physics significant if kb_it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance , `` assuming the kb_truth of the kb_null_hypothesis '' . kb_a kb_statistical_physics significant result , when kb_a kb_probability ( `` p '' -value ) is less than kb_a pre-specified kb_threshold_potential ( kb_statistical_significance ) , justifies the rejection of the kb_null_hypothesis , but only if the kb_a_priori_and_a_posteriori kb_probability of the kb_null_hypothesis is not kb_high_middle_ages .in the typical kb_application_(computing) of anova , the kb_null_hypothesis is that all kb_group_(mathematics) are random samples from the same kb_population . for example , when studying the effect of different treatments on similar samples of patients , the kb_null_hypothesis would kb_beryllium that all treatments have the same effect ( perhaps kb_none_(liturgy) ) . rejecting the kb_null_hypothesis is taken to kb_mean that the differences in observed effects between treatment kb_group_(mathematics) are unlikely to kb_beryllium due to random chance .by kb_construction , hypothesis testing limits the rate of kb_type_i_errors kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics ( false positives ) to kb_a kb_statistical_significance . experimenters also wish to kb_limit_(mathematics) kb_type_ii_errors kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics ( false negatives ) .the rate of kb_type_ii_errors kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics depends largely on kb_sample_(statistics) size ( the rate is larger for smaller samples ) , kb_importancelevel ( when the standard of proof is kb_high_middle_ages , the chances of overlookingkb_a discovery are also kb_high_middle_ages ) and kb_effect_size size ( kb_a smaller kb_effect_size size is more prone to kb_type_(biology) ii kb_error ) .the terminology of anova is largely from the kb_statistical_mechanicskb_design_of_experiments of experiments . the experimenter adjusts factors andmeasures responses in an attempt to determine an effect . factors areassigned to experimental units by kb_a combination of randomization andkb_randomized_block_design to ensure the kb_validity_(logic) of the results . kb_blind_experiment keeps theweighing impartial . responses show kb_a variability that is partiallythe result of the effect and is partially random kb_error .anova is the synthesis of several kb_idea and kb_it is used for kb_cross-platform_softwarepurposes . as kb_a consequence , kb_it is difficult to define concisely or precisely .`` kb_classical_conditioning '' anova for balanced kb_big_data does kb_triliteral things at once :in short , anova is kb_a kb_statistical_mechanics kb_tool used in several ways to develop and confirm an explanation for the observed kb_big_data .additionally :as kb_a result :anova `` has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) enjoyed the status of kb_being the most used ( some wouldsay abused ) kb_statistical_mechanics technique in kb_psychology kb_research . ''anova `` is probably the most useful technique in the field ofkb_statistical_mechanics inference . ''anova is difficult to teach , particularly for kb_complex_number experiments , with kb_restricted_randomization designs kb_being kb_notorious_(1946_film) . in some kb_noun_case the properkb_application_(computing) of the method is best determined by problem kb_pattern_recognitionfollowed by the consultation of kb_a classic authoritative test .( condensed from the `` kb_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology kb_engineering kb_statistics handbook '' : kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) 5.7. kb_aglossary of doe terminology . )there are kb_triliteral classes of models used in the kb_analysis of kb_variance , and these are outlined here .the fixed-effects kb_rutherford_model ( kb_class_(biology) kb_iodine ) of kb_analysis of kb_variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or more treatments to the kb_british_subject of the kb_experiment to kb_episcopal_see whether the kb_response_variable variable values change . this allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of kb_response_variable variable values that the treatment would generate in the kb_population as kb_a whole .random-effects kb_rutherford_model ( kb_class_(biology) ii ) is used when the treatments are not fixed . this occurs when the various kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors levels are sampled from kb_a larger kb_population . because the levels themselves are random kb_variable_(mathematics) , some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments ( kb_a multi-variable generalization of kb_simple_polygon differences ) differ from the fixed-effects kb_rutherford_model .kb_a mixed-effects kb_rutherford_model ( kb_class_(biology) iii ) contains experimental factors of both fixed and random-effects types , with appropriately different interpretations and kb_analysis for the kb_2_(number) types .example :teaching experiments could kb_beryllium performed by kb_a kb_college or kb_aarhus_university kb_departments_of_franceto find kb_a good introductory textbook , with each text considered kb_atreatment . the fixed-effects kb_rutherford_model would compare kb_a kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of candidatekb_literature . the random-effects kb_rutherford_model would determine whether importantdifferences exist among kb_a kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of randomly selected kb_literature . themixed-effects kb_rutherford_model would compare the ( fixed ) incumbent kb_literature torandomly selected alternatives .kb_definable_set fixed and random effects has proven elusive , with competingdefinitions arguably leading toward kb_a kb_linguistic_anthropology quagmire .the kb_analysis of kb_variance has been studied from several approaches , the most common of which uses kb_a kb_linear_model that relates the response to the treatments and kb_periodic_table_block . note that the kb_rutherford_model is kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history in parameters but may kb_beryllium nonlinear across kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors levels . kb_interpretation_(logic) is easy when kb_big_data is balanced across factors but much deeper understanding is needed for unbalanced kb_big_data .the kb_analysis of kb_variance can kb_beryllium presented in terms of kb_a kb_linear_model , which makes the following assumptions about the kb_probability_distribution of the responses :the separate assumptions of the textbook kb_rutherford_model imply that the kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics are independently , identically , and normally distributed for fixed effects models , that is , that the kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics ( formula_1 ) are independent andin kb_a kb_randomized_controlled_trial controlled kb_experiment , the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units , following the experimental protocol . this randomization is objective and declared before the kb_experiment is carried out . the objective random-assignment is used to test the kb_importance of the kb_null_hypothesis , following the kb_idea of kb_charles_sanders_peirce peirce and kb_ronald_fisher fisher . this design-based kb_analysis was discussed and kb_adaptation by kb_francis_j._anscombe j. anscombe at kb_rothamsted_experimental_station experimental station and by kb_oscar_kempthorne at kb_iowa_state_university kb_aarhus_university . kempthorne and kb_histidine students make an assumption of `` kb_units_of_measurement treatment additivity '' , which is discussed in the books of kempthorne and kb_david_r._cox cox .in its simplest kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , the assumption of unit-treatment additivity kb_sovereign_state that the observed response formula_3 from experimental kb_units_of_measurement formula_4 when receiving treatment formula_5 can kb_beryllium written as the kb_addition of the kb_units_of_measurement 's response formula_6 and the treatment-effect formula_7 , that isthe assumption of unit-treatment additivity implies that , for every treatment formula_5 , the formula_5th treatment has exactly the same effect formula_11 on every kb_experiment kb_units_of_measurement .the assumption of kb_units_of_measurement treatment additivity usually can not kb_beryllium directly kb_falsifiability , according to cox and kempthorne . however , many `` consequences '' of treatment-unit additivity can kb_beryllium kb_falsifiability . for kb_a randomized kb_experiment , the assumption of unit-treatment additivity `` implies '' that the kb_variance is constant for all treatments . therefore , by kb_contraposition , kb_a necessary condition for unit-treatment additivity is that the kb_variance is constant .the use of kb_units_of_measurement treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design-based inference that is standard in finite-population kb_survey_sampling .kempthorne uses the randomization-distribution and the assumption of `` kb_units_of_measurement treatment additivity '' to produce kb_a `` kb_derived_trait kb_linear_model '' , very similar to the textbook kb_rutherford_model discussed previously . the test kb_statistics of this kb_derived_trait kb_linear_model are closely approximated by the test kb_statistics of an appropriate normal kb_linear_model , according to approximation theorems and kb_simulation studies . however , there are differences . for example , the randomization-based kb_analysis results in kb_a small but ( strictly ) kb_negative_number correlation between the kb_observations_(pierre_belon) . in the randomization-based kb_analysis , there is `` no assumption '' of kb_a `` normal '' distribution and certainly `` no assumption '' of `` kb_independence '' . on the contrary , `` the kb_observations_(pierre_belon) are dependent '' !the randomization-based kb_analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious kb_algebra_over_a_field and extensive kb_time_(magazine) . since the randomization-based kb_analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using kb_a normal kb_linear_model , most kb_teachers emphasize the normal kb_linear_model approach . few statisticians kb_space_debris to model-based kb_analysis of balanced randomized experiments .however , when kb_applied_science to kb_big_data from non-randomized experiments or kb_observational_study , model-based kb_analysis lacks the warrant of randomization . for kb_observational_astronomy kb_big_data , the derivation of kb_confidence_and_supply intervals must use `` subjective '' models , as emphasized by kb_ronald_fisher fisher and kb_histidine followers . in practice , the estimates of treatment-effects from kb_observational_study generally are often inconsistent . in practice , `` kb_statistical_mechanics models '' and kb_observational_astronomy kb_big_data are useful for suggesting kb_hypothesis that should kb_beryllium treated very cautiously by the kb_state_school .the normal-model based anova kb_analysis assumes the kb_independence , normality andhomogeneity of variances of the residuals . therandomization-based kb_analysis assumes only the homogeneity of thevariances of the residuals ( as kb_a consequence of unit-treatmentadditivity ) and uses the randomization procedure of the kb_experiment .both these analyses require kb_homoscedasticity , as an assumption for the normal-model kb_analysis and as kb_a consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomization-based kb_analysis .however , studies of processes thatchange variances rather than means ( called kb_dispersion_(optics) effects ) havebeen successfully conducted using anova . there are`` no '' necessary assumptions for anova in its full generality , but the`` kb_fluorine '' -test used for anova hypothesis testing has assumptions and practicallimitations which are of continuing kb_interest .kb_problems_(aristotle) which do not satisfy the assumptions of anova can often kb_beryllium transformed to satisfy the assumptions .the kb_property of unit-treatment additivity is not kb_invariant_(mathematics) under kb_a `` change of scale '' , kb_sulfate statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit-treatment additivity . if the kb_response_variable variable is expected to follow kb_a parametric kb_family_(biology) of kb_probability distributions , then the kb_statistician may specify ( in the protocol for the kb_experiment or kb_observational_study ) that the responses kb_beryllium transformed to stabilize the kb_variance . also , kb_a kb_statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms kb_beryllium kb_applied_science to the responses , which are believed to follow kb_a multiplicative kb_rutherford_model .according to kb_augustin-louis_cauchy 's kb_functional_equation equation kb_theorem , the kb_logarithm is the only kb_continuous_function transformation that transforms real kb_multiplication to kb_addition .anova is used in the kb_analysis of comparative experiments , those inwhich only the difference in outcomes is of kb_interest . the kb_statistical_mechanicskb_importance of the kb_experiment is determined by kb_a kb_ratio of kb_2_(number)variances . this kb_ratio is independent of several possible alterationsto the experimental kb_observations_(pierre_belon) : adding kb_a constant to allkb_observations_(pierre_belon) does not alter kb_importance . multiplying allkb_observations_(pierre_belon) by kb_a constant does not alter kb_importance . kb_sulfate anovakb_statistical_significance result is independent of constant bias andkb_fouling kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics as kb_water_well as the units used in expressing kb_observations_(pierre_belon) .in the era of kb_mechanics kb_calculation kb_it was common tosubtract kb_a constant from all kb_observations_(pierre_belon) ( when kb_cognate todropping leading digits ) to simplify kb_big_data kb_azerbaijan_in_the_eurovision_song_contest_2009 . this is an example of kb_big_datakb_coding_(social_sciences) .the calculations of anova can kb_beryllium characterized as kb_computing kb_a kb_grammatical_numberof means and variances , dividing kb_2_(number) variances and comparing the kb_ratioto kb_a handbook kb_lightness to determine kb_statistical_significance . calculatingkb_a treatment effect is then trivial , `` the effect of any treatment isestimated by taking the difference between the kb_mean of thekb_observations_(pierre_belon) which receive the treatment and the kb_general_(united_states) kb_mean '' .anova uses traditional standardized terminology . the definitionalequation of kb_sample_(statistics) kb_variance isformula_12 , where thedivisor is called the kb_degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics) kb_freedom ( df ) , the kb_summation is calledthe kb_sum_of_squares_(statistics) kb_square_(algebra) ( kb_schutzstaffel ) , the result is called the kb_mean kb_square ( ms ) andthe squared terms are deviations from the kb_sample_(statistics) kb_mean . anovaestimates 3 kb_sample_(statistics) variances : kb_a total kb_variance based on all thekb_observation deviations from the grand kb_mean , an kb_error kb_variance based onall the kb_observation deviations from their appropriatetreatment means , and kb_a treatment kb_variance . the treatment kb_variance isbased on the deviations of treatment means from the grand kb_mean , theresult kb_being multiplied by the kb_grammatical_number of kb_observations_(pierre_belon) in eachtreatment to account for the difference between the kb_variance ofkb_observations_(pierre_belon) and the kb_variance of means .the fundamental technique is kb_a partitioning of the total kb_sum_of_squares_(statistics) kb_square_(algebra) `` kb_schutzstaffel '' into components related to the effects used in the kb_rutherford_model . for example , the kb_rutherford_model for kb_a simplified anova with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_type_(biology) of treatment at different levels .the kb_grammatical_number of kb_degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics) kb_freedom `` df '' can kb_beryllium partitioned in kb_a similar way : kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of these components ( that for kb_error ) specifies kb_a kb_chi-squared_distribution distribution which describes the associated kb_sum_of_squares_(statistics) kb_square_(algebra) , while the same is kb_truth for `` treatments '' if there is no treatment effect .kb_episcopal_see also kb_lack-of-fit_sum_of_squares kb_sum_of_squares_(statistics) kb_square_(algebra) .the `` kb_fluorine '' -test is used for comparing the factors of the total deviation . for example , in one-way , or single-factor anova , kb_statistical_significance is tested for by comparing the kb_fluorine test statisticwhere `` ms '' is kb_mean kb_square , formula_17 = kb_grammatical_number of treatments andformula_18 = total kb_grammatical_number of kb_noun_caseto the `` kb_fluorine '' -distribution with formula_19 , formula_20 kb_degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics) kb_freedom . using the `` kb_fluorine '' -distribution is kb_a kb_natural_number candidate because the test statistic is the kb_ratio of kb_2_(number) kb_image_scaling sums of kb_square_(algebra) each of which follows kb_a kb_image_scaling kb_chi-squared_distribution distribution .the expected kb_lightness of kb_fluorine is formula_21 ( where kb_neutron is the treatment kb_sample_(statistics) size )which is 1 for no treatment effect . as values of kb_fluorine increase above 1 , the kb_evidence_(law) is increasingly inconsistent with the kb_null_hypothesis . kb_2_(number) apparent experimental methods of increasing kb_fluorine are increasing the kb_sample_(statistics) size and kb_redox the kb_error kb_variance by tight experimental controls .there are kb_2_(number) methods of concluding the anova hypothesis test , both of which produce the same result :the anova `` kb_fluorine '' -test is known to kb_beryllium nearly optimal in the kb_word_sense of minimizing false kb_negative_number kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics for kb_a fixed rate of kb_false_positive kb_positive_number kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics ( i.e . maximizing kb_power_(physics) for kb_a fixed kb_statistical_significance ) . for example , to test the hypothesis that various kb_medical_abortion treatments have exactly the same effect , the `` kb_fluorine '' -test 's `` p '' -values closely approximate the kb_permutation_test test 's p-values : the approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced . such permutation tests characterize kb_uniformly_most_powerful_test with maximum kb_power_(physics) against all kb_alternative_hypothesis kb_hypothesis , as observed by rosenbaum . the anova `` kb_fluorine '' -test ( of the null-hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect ) is recommended as kb_a practical test , because of its robustness against many alternative distributions .anova consists of separable parts ; partitioning sources of kb_varianceand hypothesis testing can kb_beryllium used individually . anova is used tosupport kb_other_(philosophy) kb_statistical_mechanics tools . kb_regression_analysis is kb_first_trimester used to fit morekb_complex_number models to kb_big_data , then anova is used to compare models with theobjective of kb_artificial_selection kb_simple_polygon ( kb_alkyl ) models that adequately describe thekb_big_data . `` such models could kb_beryllium fit without any reference to anova , butanova tools could then kb_beryllium used to make some kb_word_sense of the fitted models ,and to test kb_hypothesis about batches of coefficients . ''`` [ w ] e think of the kb_analysis of kb_variance as kb_a way of understanding and structuringmultilevel models—not as an alternative to kb_regression_analysis but as kb_a kb_toolfor summarizing kb_complex_number high-dimensional inferences ...

kb_isomer exists . although this is not strictly necessary , the usage is still common in kb_noun_case where there is an important difference in kb_chemical_property between the straight-chain and

kb_de_jure distinct from the alkanes , this kb_class_(biology) of kb_hydrocarbons is referred to by some as the `` cyclic alkanes . '' as their description implies , they contain kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or more kb_ring_(mathematics) .kb_simple_polygon cycloalkanes have kb_a kb_prefix `` cyclo- '' to distinguish them from alkanes . cycloalkanes are kb_english_alphabet#letter_names as per their kb_open-chain_compound counterparts with respect to the kb_grammatical_number of kb_carbon atoms in their backbones , e.g. , kb_cyclopentane ( ch ) is kb_a kb_cycloalkane with 5 kb_carbon atoms just like kb_pentane ( ch ) , but they are joined up in kb_a five-membered kb_ring_(mathematics) . in kb_a similar manner , kb_propane and kb_cyclopropane , kb_butane and kb_cyclobutane , etc .substituted cycloalkanes are kb_english_alphabet#letter_names similarly to substituted alkanes — the kb_cycloalkane kb_ring_(mathematics) is stated , and the kb_substituents are according to their kb_positional_notation on the kb_ring_(mathematics) , with the numbering decided by the kb_cahn–ingold–prelog_priority_rules priority kb_biological_rules .the trivial ( non-systematic ) kb_toponymy for alkanes is 'paraffins ' . together , alkanes are known as the 'paraffin series ' . trivial names for kb_chemical_compound are usually historical kb_artifact_(archaeology) . they were kb_neologism before the development of kb_iupac_nomenclature names , and have been retained due to familiar usage in kb_industry . cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes .kb_it is almost certain that the kb_terminology 'paraffin ' stems from the kb_petrochemical_industry . branched-chain alkanes are called isoparaffins . the use of the kb_terminology `` paraffin '' is kb_a kb_general_(united_states) kb_terminology and often does not distinguish between pure kb_chemical_compound and mixtures of isomers , i.e. , kb_chemical_compound of the same kb_chemical_formula , e.g. , kb_pentane and kb_isopentanealkanes experience kb_intermolecular van der waals kb_afsharid_dynasty . stronger kb_intermolecular van der waals kb_afsharid_dynasty give rise to greater kb_boiling_points points of alkanes .there are kb_2_(number) determinants for the kb_strength_of_materials of the van der waals kb_afsharid_dynasty :under kb_standard_conditions conditions , from ch to ch alkanes are gaseous ; from ch to ch they are liquids ; and after ch they are solids . as the kb_boiling_point point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight , kb_it should not kb_beryllium kb_a surprise that the kb_boiling_point point has almost kb_a kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history relationship with the size ( kb_molecular_weight ) of the kb_molecule . as kb_a kb_rule_of_thumb of thumb , the kb_boiling_point point kb_ice_rise 20–30 °c for each kb_carbon added to the chain ; this rule applies to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_homologous_series .kb_a straight-chain kb_alkane kb_will_and_testament have kb_a kb_boiling_point point higher than kb_a branched-chain kb_alkane due to the greater kb_surface_area in contact , thus the greater van der waals kb_afsharid_dynasty , between adjacent molecules . for example , compare kb_isobutane ( 2-methylpropane ) and kb_n-butane ( kb_butane ) , which kb_boil at −12 and 0 °c , and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which kb_boil at 50 and 58 °c , respectively . for the latter case , kb_2_(number) molecules 2,3-dimethylbutane can `` lock '' into each kb_other_(philosophy) better than the cross-shaped 2,2-dimethylbutane , hence the greater van der waals kb_afsharid_dynasty .on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , cycloalkanes tend to have higher kb_boiling_points points than their kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules , which give kb_a kb_plane_(geometry) of kb_intermolecular contact .the kb_melting_point points of the alkanes follow kb_a similar trend to kb_boiling_points points for the same kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving as outlined above . that is , ( all kb_other_(philosophy) things kb_being equal ) the larger the kb_molecule the higher the kb_melting_point . there is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) significant difference between kb_boiling_points points and kb_melting_point points . solids have more kb_rigid_airship and fixed kb_structure than liquids . this kb_rigid_airship kb_structure requires kb_energy_industry to break down . thus the better put together kb_solid kb_structural_analysis kb_will_and_testament require more kb_energy_industry to break apart . for alkanes , this can kb_beryllium seen from the graph above ( i.e. , the blue kb_line_(geometry) ) . the odd-numbered alkanes have kb_a lower trend in kb_melting_point points than even numbered alkanes . this is because even numbered alkanes pack kb_water_well in the kb_solid kb_phase_(matter) , forming kb_a well-organized kb_structure , which requires more kb_energy_industry to break apart . the odd-numbered alkanes pack less kb_water_well and kb_sulfate the `` looser '' organized kb_solid packing kb_structure requires less kb_energy_industry to break apart .the kb_melting_point points of branched-chain alkanes can kb_beryllium either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes , again depending on the ability of the kb_alkane in kb_question to pack kb_water_well in the kb_solid kb_phase_(matter) : this is particularly kb_truth for kb_isoalkanes ( 2-methyl isomers ) , which often have kb_melting_point points higher than those of the kb_philosophy_of_history#cyclical_and_linear_history analogues .alkanes do not conduct electricity in any way , nor are they substantially kb_relative_static_permittivity by an kb_electric_field field . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , they do not kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_hydrogen bonds and are kb_insoluble in kb_polar_molecule solvents such as kb_water . since the kb_hydrogen bonds between kb_individual kb_water molecules are aligned away from an kb_alkane kb_molecule , the coexistence of an kb_alkane and kb_water leads to an increase in kb_molecular_genetics kb_order_(biology) ( kb_a kb_redox in kb_entropy ) . as there is no significant kb_chemical_bond between kb_water molecules and kb_alkane molecules , the kb_second_law_of_thermodynamics of kb_thermodynamics suggests that this kb_redox in kb_entropy should kb_beryllium minimized by minimizing the contact between kb_alkane and kb_water : alkanes are said to kb_beryllium kb_hydrophobe in that they repel kb_water .their kb_solubility in kb_nonpolar solvents is relatively good , kb_a kb_property that is called kb_lipophilicitythe kb_molecular_genetics kb_structure of the alkanes directly kb_affect_(psychology) their kb_health and kb_protein_sequencing characteristics . kb_it is kb_derived_trait from the kb_electron_configuration of kb_carbon , which has four valence electrons . the kb_carbon atoms in alkanes are always kb_orbital_hybridization , that is to say that the valence electrons are said to kb_beryllium in four kb_cognate orbitals kb_derived_trait from the combination of the 2s kb_atomic_orbital and the kb_triliteral 2p orbitals . these orbitals , which have kb_identical_particles energies , are arranged spatially in the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_a kb_tetrahedron , the kb_angle of cos ( − ) ≈ 109.47° between them .an kb_alkane kb_molecule has only kb_c–h_bond and c–c kb_single_bond bonds . the former result from the overlap of an sp kb_atomic_orbital of kb_carbon with the 1s kb_atomic_orbital of kb_a kb_hydrogen ; the latter by the overlap of kb_2_(number) sp orbitals on different kb_carbon atoms . the kb_chemical_bond lengthsthe spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp orbitals—they are tetrahedrally arranged , with an kb_angle of 109.47° between them . kb_structural_engineer formulae that represent the bonds as kb_being at kb_right-wing_politics angles to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) another , while both common and useful , do not correspond with the kb_reality .the kb_structural_engineer kb_chemical_formula and the kb_chemical_bond angles are not usually sufficient to completely describe the kb_geometry of kb_a kb_molecule . there is kb_a further kb_degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry) kb_freedom for each kb_carbon–carbon_bond kb_chemical_bond : the kb_torsion_angle between the atoms or kb_group_(mathematics) kb_bound_morpheme to the atoms at each end of the kb_chemical_bond . the spatial arrangement described by the kb_torsion_tensor angles of the kb_molecule is known as its kb_conformational_isomerismkb_ethane kb_theory_of_forms the simplest case for studying the kb_conformational_isomerism of alkanes , as there is only kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) c–c kb_chemical_bond . if kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) looks down the kb_axis_powers of the c–c kb_chemical_bond , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_will_and_testament kb_episcopal_see the so-called kb_newman_projection projection . the kb_hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear kb_carbon atoms have an kb_angle of 120° between them , resulting from the projection of the kb_base_(chemistry) of the kb_tetrahedron onto kb_a flat kb_plane_(geometry) . however , the kb_torsion_angle between kb_a given kb_hydrogen_atom attached to the front kb_carbon and kb_a given kb_hydrogen_atom attached to the rear kb_carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360° . this is kb_a consequence of the free kb_rotation_(mathematics) about kb_a carbon–carbon kb_single_bond . despite this apparent kb_freedom , only kb_2_(number) limiting conformations are important : kb_eclipsed kb_conformational_isomerism and kb_staggered_conformation kb_conformational_isomerism .the kb_2_(number) conformations , also known as rotamers , differ in kb_energy_industry : the kb_staggered_conformation kb_conformational_isomerism is 12.6 kb_kilojoule_per_mole lower in kb_energy_industry ( more stable ) than the kb_eclipsed kb_conformational_isomerism ( the least stable ) .this difference in kb_energy_industry between the kb_2_(number) conformations , known as the kb_torsion_energy , is low compared to the kb_thermal_conductivity kb_energy_industry of an kb_ethane kb_molecule at ambient kb_temperature . there is constant kb_rotation_(mathematics) about the c–c kb_chemical_bond . the kb_time_(magazine) taken for an kb_ethane kb_molecule to pass from kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_staggered_conformation kb_conformational_isomerism to the kb_next , kb_cognate to the kb_rotation_(mathematics) of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) ch kb_group_(periodic_table) by 120° relative to the kb_other_(philosophy) , is of the kb_order_(biology) of 10 seconds .the case of kb_higher_alkanes alkanes is more kb_complex_number but based on similar principles , with the antiperiplanar kb_conformational_isomerism always kb_being the most favored around each kb_carbon–carbon_bond kb_chemical_bond . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , alkanes are usually shown in kb_a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models . the actual kb_structure kb_will_and_testament always differ somewhat from these idealized kb_theory_of_forms , as the differences in kb_energy_industry between the conformations are small compared to the kb_thermal_conductivity kb_energy_industry of the molecules : kb_alkane molecules have no fixed kb_structural_engineer kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , whatever the models may suggest .virtually all kb_organic_compounds contain carbon–carbon , and carbon–hydrogen bonds , and kb_sulfate show some of the features of alkanes in their kb_emission_spectrum . alkanes are notable for having no kb_other_(philosophy) kb_group_(mathematics) , and therefore for the `` absence '' of kb_other_(philosophy) kb_characteristic_(algebra) kb_spectroscopy features of kb_a different kb_functional_group kb_group_(periodic_table) like kb_alcohol_(chemistry) , kb_aldehyde , kb_carboxylic_acid etc .the carbon–hydrogen kb_stretching kb_musical_mode gives kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force absorption between 2850 and 2960 kb_wavenumber , while the carbon–carbon kb_stretching kb_musical_mode absorbs between 800 and 1300 kb_wavenumber . the carbon–hydrogen bending modes depend on the kb_nature of the kb_group_(periodic_table) : kb_methyl_group kb_group_(mathematics) show bands at 1450 kb_wavenumber and 1375 kb_wavenumber , while methylene kb_group_(mathematics) show bands at 1465 kb_wavenumber and 1450 kb_wavenumber . kb_carbon chains with more than four kb_carbon atoms show kb_a weak absorption at around 725 kb_wavenumber .the kb_proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at `` δ '' = 0.5–1.5 . the carbon-13 resonances depend on the kb_grammatical_number of kb_hydrogen atoms attached to the kb_carbon : `` δ '' = 8–30 ( kb_primary_education , kb_methyl_group , –ch ) , 15–55 ( kb_secondary_school , methylene , –ch– ) , 20–60 ( kb_tertiary_healthcare , methyne , kb_c–h_bond ) and quaternary . the carbon-13 kb_resonance of quaternary kb_carbon atoms is characteristically weak , due to the lack of kb_nuclear_overhauser_effect overhauser effect and the kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_relaxation_time , and can kb_beryllium missed in weak samples , or samples that have not been run for kb_a sufficiently kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_time_(magazine) .alkanes have kb_a kb_high_middle_ages kb_ionization_energy , and the kb_molecular_genetics kb_ion is usually weak . the fragmentation kb_pattern can kb_beryllium difficult to interpret , but , in the case of branched chain alkanes , the kb_carbon_chain is preferentially cleaved at kb_tertiary_healthcare or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals . the fragment resulting from the loss of kb_a kb_single_bond kb_methyl_group ( `` kb_mole_(unit) '' − 15 ) is often absent , and kb_other_(philosophy) fragments are often spaced by intervals of fourteen kb_mass_(liturgy) units , corresponding to sequential loss of ch kb_group_(mathematics) .alkanes are only weakly kb_reactivity_(chemistry) with kb_ionic_crystal and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_polar_molecule substances . the kb_acid_dissociation_constant constant ( kb_pka ) values of all alkanes are above 60 , hence they are practically kb_inert_gas to acids and kb_base_(chemistry) ( kb_episcopal_see : kb_carbon acids ) . this inertness is the source of the kb_terminology `` paraffins '' ( with the kb_meaning_(linguistics) here of `` lacking affinity '' ) . in kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil the kb_alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years .however kb_redox reactions of alkanes , in kb_particular with kb_oxygen and the halogens , are possible as the kb_carbon atoms are in kb_a strongly kb_redox condition ; in the case of kb_methane , the lowest possible kb_oxidation_state for kb_carbon ( −4 ) is reached . reaction with kb_oxygen ( `` if '' present in sufficient kb_quantity to satisfy the reaction kb_stoichiometry ) leads to kb_combustion without any smoke , producing kb_carbon_dioxide and kb_water . kb_free_radical_halogenation halogenation reactions occur with halogens , leading to the production of kb_haloalkanes . in kb_addition , alkanes have been shown to interact with , and bind to , certain kb_transition_metal complexes in kb_carbon-hydrogen_bond_activation activation .free radicals , molecules with unpaired electrons , play kb_a kb_prespa_lake role in most reactions of alkanes , such as kb_cracking_(chemistry) and kb_protestant_reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers .in highly branched alkanes , the kb_bond_angle may differ significantly from the optimal kb_lightness ( 109.5° ) in kb_order_(biology) to allow the different kb_group_(mathematics) sufficient kb_space . this kb_causes_of_autism kb_a tension in the kb_molecule , known as kb_steric_hindrance hindrance , and can substantially increase the kb_reactivity_(chemistry) .all alkanes react with kb_oxygen in kb_a kb_combustion reaction , although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the kb_grammatical_number of kb_carbon atoms increases . the kb_general_(united_states) equation for complete kb_combustion is :in the absence of sufficient kb_oxygen , kb_carbon_monoxide or even kb_soot can kb_beryllium formed , as shown kb_#ecclesiastical_history :for example , kb_methane :kb_episcopal_see the kb_standard_enthalpy_change_of_formation_(data_table)#alkanes of formation table for detailed kb_big_data .the kb_standard_enthalpy_change_of_combustion enthalpy change of kb_combustion , δ '' kb_hydrogen '' , for alkanes increases by about 650 kb_kilojoule_per_mole per ch kb_group_(periodic_table) . branched-chain alkanes have lower values of δ '' kb_hydrogen '' than straight-chain alkanes of the same kb_grammatical_number of kb_carbon atoms , and kb_sulfate can kb_beryllium seen to kb_beryllium somewhat more stable .alkanes react with halogens in kb_a so-called `` kb_free_radical_halogenation halogenation '' reaction . the kb_hydrogen atoms of the kb_alkane are progressively replaced by kb_halogen atoms . free radicals are the kb_reactivity_(chemistry) kb_species that participate in the reaction , which usually leads to kb_a kb_mixture of products . the reaction is highly kb_exothermickb_cracking_(chemistry) breaks larger molecules into smaller ones . this can kb_beryllium done with kb_a kb_thermal_conductivity or catalytic method . the kb_thermal_conductivity kb_cracking_(chemistry) process follows kb_a kb_homolysis_(chemistry) kb_mechanism_(biology) with formation of free-radicals . the catalytic kb_cracking_(chemistry) process involves the presence of kb_acid kb_catalysis ( usually kb_solid acids such as kb_silica-alumina and zeolites ) , which promote kb_a kb_heterolytic_cleavage ( asymmetric ) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of kb_ions of kb_phyllotaxis charges , usually kb_a kb_carbocation and the very unstable kb_hydride kb_anion . carbon-localized free radicals and kb_cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement , c–c scission in kb_positional_notation kb_beta_decay ( i.e. , kb_cracking_(chemistry) ) and kb_intramolecular and kb_intermolecular kb_hydrogen transfer or kb_hydride transfer . in both types of processes , the corresponding kb_reactivity_(chemistry) intermediates ( radicals , kb_ions ) are permanently regenerated , and thus they proceed by kb_a self-propagating chain kb_mechanism_(biology) . the chain of reactions is eventually terminated by kb_political_radicalism or kb_ion kb_recombination_(cosmology) .dragan and kb_histidine colleague were the kb_first_trimester to report about isomerization in alkanes . isomerization and kb_protestant_reformation are processes in which straight-chain alkanes are heated in the presence of kb_a kb_platinum kb_catalyst . in isomerization , the alkanes become branched-chain isomers . in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_lexical_semantics , kb_it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens , keeping the same kb_molecular_weight . in kb_protestant_reformation , the alkanes become cycloalkanes or kb_aromatic kb_hydrocarbons , giving off kb_hydrogen as kb_a by-product . both of these processes raise the kb_octane_number of the kb_matter . kb_butane is the most common kb_alkane that is put under the process of isomerization , as kb_it makes many branched alkanes with kb_high_middle_ages kb_octane kb_grammatical_number .alkanes kb_will_and_testament react with kb_steam in the presence of kb_a kb_nickel kb_catalyst to give kb_hydrogen . alkanes can kb_beryllium kb_chlorosulfonation and kb_nitration , although both reactions require special conditions . the kb_fermentation_(biochemistry) of alkanes to carboxylic acids is of some technical importance . in the kb_reed_reaction reaction , kb_sulfur_dioxide , kb_chlorine and kb_light convert kb_hydrocarbons to kb_sulfonic_acid kb_chlorides . kb_nucleophilic_abstraction kb_abstraction can kb_beryllium used to separate an kb_alkane from

kb_methane , 1.5 kb_parts_per_million kb_ethane ) . kb_titan_(mythology) ( 1.6 % kb_methane ) , kb_a kb_satellite of kb_saturn , was examined by the `` kb_christiaan_huygens '' kb_interplanetary_probe , which indicated that kb_titan_(mythology) 's kb_earth's_atmosphere periodically rains kb_liquid kb_methane onto the kb_moon 's kb_surface_(topology) . also on kb_titan_(mythology) the cassini mission has imaged seasonal methane/ethane kb_list_of_lakes_in_alberta near the kb_polar_molecule kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey of kb_titan_(mythology) . kb_methane and kb_ethane have also been kb_discovery_of_the_chemical_elements in the kb_tail of the kb_comet kb_hyakutake . kb_protein_sequencing kb_analysis showed that the abundances of kb_ethane and kb_methane were roughly equal , which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar kb_space , away from the kb_sun , which would have kb_evaporation these kb_volatiles molecules . alkanes have also been kb_discovery_of_the_chemical_elements in meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites .kb_trace_radioisotope of kb_methane kb_gas ( about 0.0002 % or kb_battle_of_anguilla ppb ) occur in the kb_earth 's kb_earth's_atmosphere , produced primarily by kb_methanogenesis microorganisms , such as kb_archaea in the gut of ruminants .the most important commercial sources for alkanes are kb_natural_gas and kb_palm_oil . kb_natural_gas contains primarily kb_methane and kb_ethane , with some kb_propane and kb_butane : kb_palm_oil is kb_a kb_mixture of kb_liquid alkanes and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hydrocarbons environment and converted over many millions of years at kb_high_middle_ages temperatures and kb_high_middle_ages kb_pressure to their kb_electric_current kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . kb_natural_gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction :these kb_hydrocarbon kb_deposit_(geology) , collected in porous kb_rock_(geology) trapped beneath impermeable cap kb_rock_(geology) , comprise commercial kb_oil_fields . they have formed over millions of years and once exhausted can not kb_beryllium readily replaced . the depletion of these kb_hydrocarbons reserves is the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) for what is known as the kb_energy_crisis .kb_methane is also present in what is called kb_biogas , produced by kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing and decaying kb_matter , which is kb_a possible kb_renewable_energy_source source .alkanes have kb_a low kb_solubility in kb_water , kb_sulfate the content in the oceans is negligible ; however , at kb_high_middle_ages pressures and low temperatures ( such as at the bottom of the oceans ) , kb_methane can co-crystallize with kb_water to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_solid kb_methane_clathratecertain types of kb_bacteria can kb_metabolism alkanes : they prefer even-numbered kb_carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-numbered chains .on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , certain kb_archaea , the methanogens , produce kb_prespa_lake quantities of kb_methane by the kb_metabolism of kb_carbon_dioxide or kb_other_(philosophy) kb_oxidation kb_organic_compounds . the kb_energy_industry is released by the kb_redox of kb_hydrogen :methanogens are also the producers of kb_marsh_gas kb_gas in kb_wetlands , and release about kb_2_(number) kb_billion kb_tonnes of kb_methane per year—the atmospheric content of this kb_gas is produced nearly exclusively by them . the kb_methane output of kb_cattle and kb_other_(philosophy) herbivores , which can release 30 to 50 gallons per day , and of kb_termites , is also due to methanogens . they also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the kb_intestines of humans . kb_methanogenesis kb_archaea are , hence , at the end of the kb_carbon_cycle , with kb_carbon kb_being released back into kb_earth's_atmosphere kb_earth's_atmosphere after having been fixed by kb_photosynthesis . kb_it is probable that our kb_electric_current kb_deposit_(geology) of kb_natural_gas were formed in kb_a similar way .alkanes also play kb_a role , if kb_a minor role , in the kb_biology of the kb_triliteral kb_eukaryote kb_group_(mathematics) of organisms : kb_fungi , plants and kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing . some specialized yeasts , e.g. , `` candida tropicale '' , `` kb_pichia '' sp. , `` kb_rhodotorula '' sp. , can use alkanes as kb_a source of kb_carbon or kb_energy_industry . the fungus `` kb_amorphotheca_resinae resinae '' prefers the longer-chain alkanes in kb_aviation_fuel , and can cause serious kb_problems_(aristotle) for kb_aircraft in kb_tropical kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey .in plants , the kb_solid long-chain alkanes are found in the kb_plant_cuticle and kb_epicuticular_wax kb_beeswax of many kb_species , but are only rarely kb_major_(united_states) kb_electoral_district . they protect the kb_plant against kb_water loss , prevent the kb_leaching_(agriculture) of important kb_minerals by the kb_rain , and protect against kb_bacteria , kb_fungi , and harmful insects . the kb_carbon chains in kb_plant alkanes are usually odd-numbered , between 27 and 33 kb_carbon atoms in kb_length and are made by the plants by kb_decarboxylation of even-numbered fatty acids . the exact kb_function_composition of the layer of kb_beeswax is not only species-dependent but changes also with the kb_season and such kb_environmental_factors factors as lighting conditions , kb_temperature or kb_humidity .more kb_volatiles short-chain alkanes are also produced by and found in kb_plant kb_tissue_(biology) . the kb_jeffrey_pine kb_pine is noted for producing exceptionally kb_high_middle_ages levels of `` kb_neutron '' -heptane in its kb_resin , for which kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving its distillate was designated as the kb_0_(number) point for kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_octane_rating . floral scents have also kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) been known to contain kb_volatiles kb_alkane components , and `` kb_neutron '' -nonane is kb_a significant component in the scent of some kb_rosaceae . kb_emission_spectra of gaseous and kb_volatiles alkanes such as kb_ethane , kb_pentane , and kb_hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels , though they are not generally considered to kb_beryllium kb_a kb_major_(united_states) component of biogenic kb_air_pollution .edible kb_vegetable kb_cooking_oil also typically contain small kb_egyptian_fraction of biogenic alkanes with kb_a wide kb_visible_spectrum of kb_carbon kb_grammatical_number , mainly kb_group_8_element to kb_35_arietis , usually peaking in the low to kb_upper_egypt 20s , with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram ( kb_part_per_million per million by weight ) and sometimes over kb_a hundred for the total kb_alkane kb_fraction_(mathematics) .alkanes are found in kb_animal products , although they are less important than unsaturated kb_hydrocarbons . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) example is the kb_shark kb_liver_oil , which is approximately 14 % kb_pristane ( 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane , ch ) . they are important as pheromones , kb_protein_sequencing messenger materials , on which insects depend for kb_communication . in some kb_species , e.g . the support beetle `` kb_xylotrechus_colonus colonus '' , kb_pentacosane ( ch ) , 3-methylpentaicosane ( ch ) and 9-methylpentaicosane ( ch ) are transferred by kb_human_body contact . with others like the kb_tsetse_fly kb_flight `` glossina morsitans morsitans '' , the kb_pheromone contains the four alkanes 2-methylheptadecane ( ch ) , 17,21-dimethylheptatriacontane ( ch ) , 15,19-dimethylheptatriacontane ( ch ) and 15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane ( ch ) , and acts by smell over longer distances . kb_waggle_dance kb_honey beeskb_one_(australian_tv_channel) example , in which both kb_plant and kb_animal alkanes play kb_a role , is the ecological relationship between the kb_sand_bee ( `` kb_andrena_nigroaenea nigroaenea '' ) and the kb_early_spider_orchid kb_spider kb_orchid ( `` kb_ophrys_sphegodes sphegodes '' ) ; the latter is dependent for kb_pollination on the former . kb_sand bees use pheromones in kb_order_(biology) to identify kb_a kb_mating ; in the case of `` a. nigroaenea '' , the females emit kb_a kb_mixture of kb_tricosane ( ch ) , kb_pentacosane ( ch ) and kb_heptacosaneas stated kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet , the most important source of alkanes is kb_natural_gas and kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil . alkanes are separated in an kb_oil_refinery by kb_fractional_distillation kb_distillation and processed into many different products .the kb_fischer–tropsch_process process is kb_a method to kb_biosynthesis kb_liquid kb_hydrocarbons , including alkanes , from kb_carbon_monoxide and kb_hydrogen . this method is used to produce substitutes for kb_petroleum distillates .there is usually little need for alkanes to kb_beryllium synthesized in the kb_laboratory , since they are usually commercially kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance . also , alkanes are generally kb_reactivity_(chemistry) chemically or biologically , and do not undergo kb_functional_group kb_group_(periodic_table) interconversions cleanly . when alkanes are produced in the kb_laboratory , kb_it is often kb_a side-product of kb_a reaction . for example , the use of `` kb_neutron '' -butyllithium as kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_base_(chemistry) gives the conjugate kb_acid , `` kb_neutron '' -butane as kb_a side-product :however , at times kb_it may kb_beryllium desirable to make kb_a kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) of kb_a kb_molecule into an alkane-like functionality ( kb_alkyl kb_group_(periodic_table) ) using the above or similar methods . for example , an kb_ethyl_group is an kb_alkyl kb_group_(periodic_table) ; when this is attached to kb_a kb_hydroxyl kb_group_(periodic_table) , kb_it gives kb_ethanol , which is not an kb_alkane . to kb_women's_suffrage kb_sulfate , the best-known methods are kb_hydrogenation of kb_alkenes :alkanes or kb_alkyl kb_group_(mathematics) can also kb_beryllium prepared directly from kb_alkyl halides in the kb_corey–house_synthesis reaction . the kb_barton–mccombie_deoxygenation deoxygenation removes kb_hydroxy_group kb_group_(mathematics) from alcohols e.g .and the kb_clemmensen_reduction kb_redox removes kb_carbonyl kb_group_(mathematics) from kb_aldehydes and ketones to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism alkanes or alkyl-substituted kb_chemical_compound e.g . :the applications of alkanes depend on the kb_grammatical_number of kb_carbon atoms . the kb_first_trimester four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes , and in some countries for electricity generation . kb_methane and kb_ethane are the main components of kb_natural_gas ; they are normally stored as gases under kb_pressure . kb_it is , however , easier to kb_transport them as liquids : this requires both kb_dynamic_range_compression and cooling of the kb_gas .kb_propane and kb_butane are gases at atmospheric kb_pressure that can kb_beryllium liquefied at fairly low pressures and are commonly known as kb_liquified_petroleum_gas kb_petroleum kb_gas ( lpg ) . kb_propane is used in kb_propane kb_gas burners and as kb_a kb_fuel for road vehicles , kb_butane in kb_space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters . both are used as propellants in kb_aerosol sprays .from kb_pentane to kb_octane the alkanes are highly kb_volatiles liquids . they are used as fuels in internal kb_combustion engines , as they vaporize easily on kb_azerbaijan_in_the_eurovision_song_contest_2009 into the kb_combustion_chamber without forming droplets , which would impair the uniformity of the kb_combustion . branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition , which kb_causes_of_autism kb_engine_knocking , than their straight-chain kb_homology_(chemistry) . this propensity to premature ignition is measured by the kb_octane_rating of the kb_fuel , where kb_2,2,4-trimethylpentane ( `` isooctane '' ) has an arbitrary kb_lightness of 100 , and kb_heptane has kb_a kb_lightness of kb_0_(number) . apart from their use as fuels , the middle alkanes are also good solvents for kb_nonpolar substances .alkanes from kb_nonane to , for instance , kb_hexadecane ( an kb_alkane with sixteen kb_carbon atoms ) are liquids of higher kb_viscosity , less and less suitable for use in kb_gasoline . they kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism instead the

kb_toponymy for kb_hexadecane . however , the higher kb_melting_point points of these alkanes can cause kb_problems_(aristotle) at low temperatures and in kb_polar_molecule

kb_asphalt , used , for example , in road surfacing . however , the kb_higher_alkanes alkanes have little kb_lightness and are usually split into lower alkanes by kb_cracking_(chemistry) .some

on the kb_type_(biology) of case and the kb_biological_rules of the kb_court in the kb_jurisdiction where the case was prosecuted . there are many types of kb_standard_of_review of kb_review for appeals , such as `` kb_trial_de_novo '' and kb_abuse_of_discretion of discretion . however , most appeals begin when kb_a party kb_file_(tool) kb_a kb_petition_for_review kb_review to kb_a higher kb_court for the purpose of overturning the kb_lower_court kb_court 's decision .an kb_appellate_court kb_court is kb_a kb_court that hears kb_noun_case on kb_appeal from another kb_court . depending on the kb_particular kb_law kb_biological_rules that apply to each circumstance , kb_a party to kb_a kb_court_case kb_world_health_organization is unhappy with the result might kb_beryllium able to challenge that result in an kb_appellate_court kb_court on specific grounds . these grounds typically could include kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics of kb_law , kb_fact , procedure or due process . in different jurisdictions , appellate courts are also called appeals courts , courts of appeals , superior courts , or supreme courts .the specific procedures for appealing , including even whether there is kb_a kb_right-wing_politics of kb_appeal from kb_a kb_particular kb_type_(biology) of decision , can vary greatly from kb_state_of_matter to kb_state_of_matter . the kb_right-wing_politics to file an kb_appeal can also vary from kb_state_of_matter to kb_state_of_matter ; for example , the kb_new_jersey_constitution vests kb_judicial_power kb_power_(physics) in kb_a supreme kb_court , kb_a superior kb_court , and kb_other_(philosophy) courts of limited kb_jurisdiction , with an kb_appellate_court kb_court kb_being part of the superior kb_court .kb_a party kb_world_health_organization kb_file_(tool) an kb_appeal is called an `` appellant '' , `` kb_plaintiff in kb_error '' , `` petitioner '' or `` pursuer '' , and kb_a party on the kb_other_(philosophy) side is called kb_a `` appellee '' . kb_a `` cross-appeal '' is an kb_appeal brought by the respondent . for example , suppose at kb_jury_trial the judge found for the kb_plaintiff and kb_totally_ordered_set the kb_defendant to pay kb_usd 50,000 . if the kb_defendant kb_file_(tool) an kb_appeal arguing that kb_he_(letter) should not have to pay any kb_money , then the kb_plaintiff might file kb_a cross-appeal arguing that the kb_defendant should have to pay kb_usd 200,000 instead of kb_usd 50,000 .the appellant is the party kb_world_health_organization , having kb_lost_film part or all their kb_lawsuit in kb_a kb_lower_court kb_court decision , is appealing to kb_a higher kb_court to have their case reconsidered . this is usually done on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) that the kb_lower_court kb_court judge erred in the kb_application_(computing) of kb_law , but kb_it may also kb_beryllium possible to kb_appeal on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of kb_court misconduct , or that kb_a finding of kb_fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the kb_evidence_(law) .the appellant in the kb_new_world case can kb_beryllium either the kb_plaintiff ( or claimant ) , kb_defendant , third-party kb_intervenor , or respondent ( appellee ) from the kb_lower_case case , depending on kb_world_health_organization was the losing party . the winning party from the kb_lower_court kb_court , however , is now the respondent . in unusual kb_noun_case the appellant can kb_beryllium the victor in the kb_court kb_#ecclesiastical_history , but still kb_appeal .an appellee is the party to an kb_appeal in which the kb_lower_court kb_court kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition was in its favor . the appellee is required to respond to the kb_petition , oral arguments , and kb_law kb_brief_(law) of the appellant . in kb_general_(united_states) , the appellee takes the procedural posture that the kb_lower_court kb_court 's decision should kb_beryllium affirmed .an kb_appeal `` as of kb_right-wing_politics '' is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) that is guaranteed by kb_statute or some underlying kb_constitution_of_albania or kb_law kb_principle_(chemistry) . the kb_appellate_court kb_court can not refuse to listen to the kb_appeal . an kb_appeal `` by leave '' or `` permission '' requires the appellant to obtain leave to kb_appeal ; in such kb_a situation either or both of the kb_lower_court kb_court and the kb_court may have the discretion to kb_ulysses_s._grant or refuse the appellant 's demand to kb_appeal the kb_lower_court kb_court 's decision . in the supreme kb_court , kb_review in most kb_noun_case is kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance only if the kb_court exercises its discretion and grants kb_a writ of certiorari .in kb_tort , kb_equity_(law) , or kb_other_(philosophy) civil matters either party to kb_a previous case may file an kb_appeal . in criminal matters , however , the kb_state_of_matter or prosecution generally has no kb_appeal `` as of kb_right-wing_politics '' . and due to the kb_double_jeopardy jeopardy kb_principle_(chemistry) , the kb_state_of_matter or prosecution may never kb_appeal kb_a kb_jury or bench verdict of acquittal . but in some jurisdictions , the kb_state_of_matter or prosecution may kb_appeal `` as of kb_right-wing_politics '' from kb_a kb_trial_court 's dismissal of an kb_indictment in whole or in part or from kb_a kb_trial_court 's granting of kb_a kb_defendant 's suppression kb_motion_(physics) . likewise , in some jurisdictions , the kb_state_of_matter or prosecution may kb_appeal an issue of kb_law `` by leave '' from kb_the_trial kb_trial_court or the kb_appellate_court kb_court . the ability of the prosecution to kb_appeal kb_a decision in favor of kb_a kb_defendant varies significantly internationally . all parties must present grounds to kb_appeal , or kb_it kb_will_and_testament not kb_beryllium heard .by kb_fan_convention in some kb_law reports , the appellant is kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_first_trimester . this can kb_mean that where kb_it is the kb_defendant kb_world_health_organization appeals , the kb_toponymy of the case in kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law reports reverses ( in some kb_noun_case twice ) as the appeals kb_cold_working their way up the kb_court hierarchy . this is not always kb_truth , however . in the kb_united_states_federal_courts , the parties ' names always stay in the same kb_order_(biology) as the kb_lower_court kb_court when an kb_appeal is taken to the kb_united_states_courts_of_appeals courts of appeals , and are re-ordered only if the kb_appeal reaches the supreme kb_court .many jurisdictions recognize kb_2_(number) types of appeals , particularly in the criminal kb_context_(language_use) . the kb_first_trimester is the traditional `` direct '' kb_appeal in which the appellant kb_file_(tool) an kb_appeal with the kb_next higher kb_court of kb_review . the kb_second is the collateral kb_appeal or post-conviction kb_petition , in which the petitioner-appellant kb_file_(tool) the kb_appeal in kb_a kb_court of kb_first_trimester instance—usually the kb_court that tried the case .the kb_key_(cryptography) distinguishing kb_von_neumann_algebra#factors between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in kb_state_court_(united_states) , and the latter in kb_united_states_federal_courts .kb_relief in post-conviction is rare and is most often found in kb_list_of_australian_capital_cities or violent kb_felony kb_noun_case . the typical scenario involves an incarcerated kb_defendant locating kb_dna kb_evidence_(law) demonstrating the kb_defendant 's actual innocence .`` appellate kb_review '' is the kb_general_(united_states) kb_terminology for the process by which courts with appellate kb_jurisdiction kb_take kb_jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts . kb_it is distinguished from kb_judicial_review kb_review , which refers to the kb_court 's overriding kb_constitution_of_albania or kb_statute kb_right-wing_politics to determine if kb_a kb_legislative act or kb_administration_(government) decision is defective for jurisdictional or kb_other_(philosophy) reasons ( which may vary by kb_jurisdiction ) .in most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate kb_review is by filing an kb_appeal of the kb_final_judgment kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition . generally , an kb_appeal of the kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition kb_will_and_testament also allow kb_appeal of all kb_other_(philosophy) kb_order_(biology) or rulings made by kb_the_trial kb_trial_court in the course of the case . this is because such kb_order_(biology) can not kb_beryllium appealed `` as of kb_right-wing_politics '' . however , certain critical interlocutory kb_court kb_order_(biology) , such as the denial of kb_a request for an interim kb_injunction , or an kb_order_(biology) holding kb_a kb_grammatical_person in kb_contempt_of_court of kb_court , can kb_beryllium appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of .there are kb_2_(number) distinct kb_theory_of_forms of appellate kb_review , `` direct '' and `` collateral '' . for example , kb_a criminal kb_defendant may kb_beryllium convicted in kb_state_of_matter kb_court , and lose on `` direct kb_appeal '' to higher kb_state_of_matter appellate courts , and if unsuccessful , mount kb_a `` collateral '' action such as filing for kb_a writ of kb_habeas_corpus corpus in the kb_united_states_federal_courts . generally speaking , `` [ d ] irect kb_appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of kb_a kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition and allege kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics of kb_law or kb_fact . ... [ collateral kb_review ] , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , provide [ kb_sulfur ] an independent and civil kb_inquiry into the kb_validity_(logic) of kb_a conviction and kb_sentence_(law) , and as such are generally limited to challenges to kb_constitution_of_albania , jurisdictional , or kb_other_(philosophy) fundamental violations that occurred at kb_jury_trial .

kb_law courts , appellate kb_review of kb_lower_court kb_court decisions may also kb_beryllium obtained by filing kb_a kb_petition_for_review kb_review by kb_prerogative_writ writ in certain kb_noun_case . there is no corresponding kb_right-wing_politics to kb_a writ in any pure or kb_continental_dollar kb_civil_law_(legal_system) kb_law kb_law kb_systems_analysis , though some mixed kb_systems_analysis such as kb_province_of_quebec_(1763–1791) recognize these prerogative writs .after exhausting the kb_first_trimester kb_appeal as of kb_right-wing_politics , defendants usually kb_petition the highest kb_state_of_matter kb_court to kb_review the decision . this kb_appeal is known as kb_a direct kb_appeal . the highest kb_state_of_matter kb_court , generally known as the supreme kb_court , exercises discretion over whether kb_it kb_will_and_testament kb_review the case . on direct kb_appeal , kb_a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an kb_error that occurred at kb_jury_trial or some kb_other_(philosophy) stage in the adjudicative process .an appellant 's kb_lawsuit ( kb_sulfur ) must usually kb_beryllium preserved at kb_jury_trial . this means that the kb_defendant had to kb_space_debris to the kb_error when kb_it occurred in kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial . because kb_constitution_of_albania claims are of great kb_apparent_magnitude , appellate courts might kb_beryllium more lenient to kb_review the kb_lawsuit even if kb_it was not preserved . for example , kb_connecticut applies the following standard to kb_review unpreserved claims : 1.the record is adequate to kb_review the alleged kb_lawsuit of kb_error ; 2. the kb_lawsuit is of kb_constitution_of_albania kb_apparent_magnitude alleging the violation of kb_a fundamental kb_right-wing_politics ; 3. the alleged kb_constitution_of_albania violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the kb_defendant of kb_a fair kb_jury_trial ; 4. if kb_grammatical_subject to harmless kb_error kb_analysis , the kb_state_of_matter has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged kb_constitution_of_albania violation beyond kb_a reasonable doubt .all kb_sovereign_state have kb_a post-conviction kb_relief process . similar to kb_united_states_courts_of_appeals post-conviction kb_relief , an appellant can kb_petition the kb_court to correct alleged fundamental kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics that were not corrected on direct kb_review . typical claims might include kb_ineffective_assistance_of_counsel assistance of counsel and actual innocence based on kb_new_world kb_evidence_(law) . these proceedings are normally separate from the direct kb_appeal , however some kb_sovereign_state allow for collateral kb_relief to kb_beryllium sought on direct kb_appeal . after direct kb_appeal , the conviction is considered final . an kb_appeal from the post conviction kb_court proceeds just as kb_a direct kb_appeal . that is , kb_it goes to the intermediate kb_appellate_court kb_court , followed by the highest kb_court . if the kb_petition is granted the appellant could kb_beryllium released from incarceration , the kb_sentence_(law) could kb_beryllium modified , or kb_a kb_new_world kb_jury_trial could kb_beryllium kb_totally_ordered_set .kb_a `` notice of kb_appeal '' is kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism or document that in many kb_noun_case is required to begin an kb_appeal . the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism is completed by the appellant or by the appellant 's kb_law representative . the kb_nature of this kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism can vary greatly from kb_country_music to kb_country_music and from kb_court to kb_court within kb_a kb_country_music .the specific kb_biological_rules of the kb_law system kb_will_and_testament dictate exactly how the kb_appeal is officially begun . for example , the appellant might have to file the notice of kb_appeal with the kb_appellate_court kb_court , or with the kb_court from which the kb_appeal is taken , or both .some courts have samples of kb_a notice of kb_appeal on the kb_court 's own kb_world_wide_web site . in kb_new_jersey , for example , the kb_administration_(government) kb_office of the kb_court has promulgated kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of notice of kb_appeal for use by appellants , though using this exact kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism is not mandatory and the failure to use kb_it is not kb_a jurisdictional kb_congenital_disorder provided that all pertinent kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) is kb_set_(mythology) forth in whatever kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of notice of kb_appeal is used .the deadline for beginning an kb_appeal can often kb_beryllium very short : traditionally , kb_it is measured in days , not months . this can vary from kb_country_music to kb_country_music , as kb_water_well as within kb_a kb_country_music , depending on the specific kb_biological_rules in kb_force . in the kb_usa_davis_cup_team kb_united_states_courts_of_appeals kb_court system , criminal defendants must file kb_a notice of kb_appeal within 10 days of the kb_azerbaijan_in_the_eurovision_song_contest_2009 of either the kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition or the kb_order_(biology) kb_being appealed , or the kb_right-wing_politics to kb_appeal is forfeited .generally speaking the kb_appellate_court kb_court examines the record of kb_evidence_(law) presented in kb_the_trial kb_trial_court and kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law that the kb_lower_court kb_court kb_applied_science and decides whether that decision was legally kb_sound or not . the kb_appellate_court kb_court kb_will_and_testament typically kb_beryllium deferential to the kb_lower_court kb_court 's findings of kb_fact ( such as whether kb_a kb_defendant committed kb_a kb_particular act ) , unless clearly erroneous , and kb_sulfate kb_will_and_testament focus on the kb_court 's kb_application_(computing) of kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law to those facts ( such as whether the act found by the kb_court to have occurred fits kb_a kb_law kb_definition at issue ) .if the kb_appellate_court kb_court finds no kb_congenital_disorder , kb_it `` affirms '' the kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition . if the kb_appellate_court kb_court does find kb_a kb_law kb_congenital_disorder in the decision `` kb_#ecclesiastical_history '' ( i.e. , in the kb_lower_court kb_court ) , kb_it may `` modify '' the ruling to correct the kb_congenital_disorder , or kb_it may nullify ( `` kb_obverse_and_reverse '' or `` vacate '' ) the whole decision or any part of kb_it . kb_it may , in kb_addition , send the case back ( `` remand '' or `` remit '' ) to the kb_lower_court kb_court for further proceedings to remedy the kb_congenital_disorder .in some kb_noun_case , an kb_appellate_court kb_court may kb_review kb_a kb_lower_court kb_court decision `` kb_trial_de_novo '' ( or completely ) , challenging even the kb_lower_court kb_court 's findings of kb_fact . this might kb_beryllium the proper kb_standard_of_review of kb_review , for example , if the kb_lower_court kb_court resolved the case by granting kb_a pre-trial kb_motion_to_dismiss dismiss or kb_motion_(physics) for kb_summary_judgment kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition which is usually based only upon written submissions to kb_the_trial kb_trial_court and not on any kb_jury_trial testimony .another situation is where kb_appeal is by way of `` re-hearing '' . certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial to kb_beryllium heard afresh in the kb_appellate_court kb_court .sometimes , the kb_appellate_court kb_court finds kb_a kb_congenital_disorder in the procedure the parties used in filing the kb_appeal and dismisses the kb_appeal without considering its merits , which has the same effect as affirming the kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition kb_#ecclesiastical_history . ( this would happen , for example , if the appellant waited too kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , under the kb_appellate_court kb_court 's kb_biological_rules , to file the kb_appeal . )generally , there is no kb_jury_trial in an kb_appellate_court kb_court , only consideration of the record of the kb_evidence_(law) presented to kb_the_trial kb_trial_court and all the pre-trial and kb_trial_court proceedings are reviewed—unless the kb_appeal is by way of re-hearing , kb_new_world kb_evidence_(law) kb_will_and_testament usually only kb_beryllium considered on kb_appeal in `` very '' rare instances , for example if that kb_material kb_evidence_(law) was unavailable to kb_a party for some very significant kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving such as kb_prosecutorial_misconduct misconduct .in some kb_systems_analysis , an kb_appellate_court kb_court kb_will_and_testament only consider the written decision of the kb_lower_court kb_court , together with any written kb_evidence_(law) that was before that kb_court and is relevant to the kb_appeal . in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_systems_analysis , the kb_appellate_court kb_court kb_will_and_testament normally consider the record of the kb_lower_court kb_court . in those kb_noun_case the record kb_will_and_testament kb_first_trimester kb_beryllium certified by the kb_lower_court kb_court .the appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the kb_appeal and the appellee ( or respondent ) can present arguments against kb_it . arguments of the parties to the kb_appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers , if represented , or `` kb_pro_se se '' if the party has not engaged kb_law kb_representation_(arts) . those arguments are presented in written kb_brief_(law) and sometimes in kb_oral_argument kb_argument_of_a_function to the kb_court at kb_a kb_hearing_loss . at such hearings each party is allowed kb_a brief presentation at which the appellate kb_book_of_judges kb_amplitude-shift_keying questions based on their kb_review of the record kb_#ecclesiastical_history and the submitted kb_brief_(law) .in an kb_adversarial_system system , appellate courts do not have the kb_power_(physics) to kb_review kb_lower_court kb_court decisions unless kb_a party appeals kb_it . therefore , if kb_a kb_lower_court kb_court has ruled in an improper manner , or against kb_precedent , that kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition kb_will_and_testament stand if not appealed – even if kb_it might have been overturned on kb_appeal .the united kb_sovereign_state kb_law system generally recognizes kb_2_(number) types of appeals : kb_a kb_jury_trial `` kb_trial_de_novo '' or an kb_appeal on the record .kb_a kb_trial_de_novo novo is usually kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance for kb_review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural kb_attribute_(role-playing_games) of kb_a formal judicial kb_jury_trial . if unchallenged , these decisions have the kb_power_(physics) to settle more minor kb_law disputes once and for all . if kb_a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such kb_a kb_tribunal , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) generally has the kb_power_(physics) to request kb_a kb_jury_trial `` kb_trial_de_novo '' by kb_a kb_court_of_record record . in such kb_a proceeding , all issues and kb_evidence_(law) may kb_beryllium kb_adaptation newly , as though never heard before , and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) is not restricted to the kb_evidence_(law) heard in the lower proceeding . sometimes , however , the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as kb_evidence_(law) , thus helping to curb frivolous appeals .in some kb_noun_case , an kb_application_(computing) for `` kb_trial_de_novo novo '' effectively erases the kb_prior kb_jury_trial as if kb_it had never taken kb_place_of_articulation . the supreme kb_court of kb_virginia has stated that ' '' this kb_court has repeatedly held that the effect of an kb_appeal to circuit kb_court is to `` annul the kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition of the inferior kb_tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous kb_jury_trial . '' ' the only exception to this is that if kb_a kb_defendant appeals kb_a conviction for kb_a crime having kb_cross-platform_software levels of offenses , where they are convicted on kb_a lesser offense , the kb_appeal is of the lesser offense ; the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses . `` [ kb_a ] kb_jury_trial on the same charges in the circuit kb_court does not violate kb_double_jeopardy jeopardy principles , . . . kb_grammatical_subject only to the limitation that conviction in [ the ] kb_united_states_territorial_court for an offense lesser included in the kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_electric_charge constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense ,permitting kb_trial_de_novo novo in the circuit kb_court only for the lesser-included offense . ''in an kb_appeal on the record from kb_a decision in kb_a judicial proceeding , both appellant and respondent are kb_bound_morpheme to kb_base_(chemistry) their arguments wholly on the proceedings and kb_human_body of kb_evidence_(law) as they were presented in the lower kb_tribunal . each seeks to prove to the higher kb_court that the result they desired was the just result . kb_stare_decisis and kb_case_law kb_law kb_female_body_shape prominently in the arguments . in kb_order_(biology) for the kb_appeal to succeed , the appellant must prove that the kb_lower_court kb_court committed kb_reversible_error , that is , an impermissible action by the kb_court acted to cause kb_a result that was unjust , and which would not have resulted had the kb_court acted properly . some examples of kb_reversible_error would kb_beryllium erroneously instructing the kb_jury on kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law applicable to the case , permitting seriously kb_improper_argument kb_argument_of_a_function by an attorney , admitting or excluding kb_evidence_(law) improperly , acting outside the kb_court 's kb_jurisdiction , injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to kb_women's_suffrage kb_sulfate , juror misconduct , etc . the failure to formally kb_space_debris at the kb_time_(magazine) , to what kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) views as improper action in the kb_lower_court kb_court , may result in the affirmance of the kb_lower_court kb_court 's kb_last_judgment#esoteric_christian_tradition on the grounds that kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) did not `` preserve the issue for kb_appeal '' by objecting .in kb_noun_case where kb_a judge rather than kb_a kb_jury decided issues of kb_fact , an kb_appellate_court kb_court kb_will_and_testament apply an `` kb_abuse_of_discretion of discretion '' kb_standard_of_review of kb_review . under this standard , the kb_appellate_court kb_court gives deference to the kb_lower_court kb_court 's view of the kb_evidence_(law) , and reverses its decision only if kb_it were kb_a clear kb_abuse_of_discretion of discretion . this is usually kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as kb_a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness . on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , the kb_appellate_court kb_court normally gives less deference to kb_a kb_lower_court kb_court 's decision on issues of kb_law , and may kb_obverse_and_reverse if kb_it finds that the kb_lower_court kb_court kb_applied_science the wrong kb_law standard .in some kb_noun_case , an appellant may successfully argue that kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law under which the lower decision was rendered was kb_constitutionality or otherwise invalid , or may convince the higher kb_court to kb_order_(biology) kb_a kb_new_world kb_jury_trial on the kb_basis_(linear_algebra) that kb_evidence_(law) kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet sought was concealed or only recently discovered . in the case of kb_new_world kb_evidence_(law) , there must kb_beryllium kb_a kb_high_middle_ages kb_probability that its presence or absence would have made kb_a kb_material difference in kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial . another issue suitable for kb_appeal in criminal kb_noun_case is effective assistance of counsel . if kb_a kb_defendant has been convicted and can prove that kb_histidine kb_lawyer did not adequately handle kb_histidine case and that there is kb_a reasonable kb_probability that the result of kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial would have been different had the kb_lawyer given competent kb_representation_(arts) , kb_he_(letter) is entitled to kb_a kb_new_world kb_jury_trial .kb_a kb_lawyer traditionally starts an kb_oral_argument kb_argument_of_a_function to any kb_appellate_court kb_court with the kb_lexical_semantics `` may kb_it please the kb_court .

.if the kb_defendant pleads kb_plea#guilty_and_not_guilty_pleas kb_guilt_(law) , kb_a date is kb_set_(mythology) for kb_a kb_preliminary_hearing kb_hearing_loss or kb_a kb_jury_trial .in the kb_past ,

( אבק ) , `` kb_dust '' ( or in post-biblical kb_word_sense kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_sand used as kb_a writing kb_surface_(topology) '' ) .the preferred plural of `` abacus '' is kb_a kb_grammatical_subject of disagreement , with both `` abacuses '' and `` abaci '' ( hard `` kb_vitamin_c '' ) in use . the kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) of an abacus is called an `` abacist '' .the period 2700–2300 bc saw the kb_first_trimester kb_appearance_(philosophy) of the kb_sumerian_language abacus , kb_a table of successive columns which delimited the successive kb_order_(biology)

'' kb_it can kb_beryllium expressed in kb_hexadecimal or any of the following kb_grammatical_number , and because the kb_calculation method at that kb_time_(magazine) is kb_a kb_chinese_characters catty equal to sixteen tael（一斤十六兩）which means kb_hexadecimal , the abacus is kb_aircraft_design_process as kb_a two-five bead .`` kb_suanpan '' can kb_beryllium used for functions kb_other_(philosophy) than counting . unlike the kb_simple_polygon counting board used in kb_elementary_school schools , very efficient kb_suanpan techniques have been kb_adaptation to do kb_multiplication , kb_division_(mathematics) , kb_addition , kb_subtraction , kb_square_root and kb_cube_root kb_root_of_a_function operations at kb_high_middle_ages speed . there are currently schools teaching students how to use kb_it .in the kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) scroll `` kb_along_the_river_during_the_qingming_festival the kb_river during the qingming festival '' painted by kb_zhang_zeduan zeduan during the kb_song_dynasty kb_dynasty ( 960–1297 ) , kb_a `` kb_suanpan '' is clearly visible beside an account book and kb_physician 's prescriptions on the counter of an kb_apothecary 's ( feibao ) .the similarity of the kb_roman_abacus to the kb_chinese_characters kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) suggests that kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) could have inspired the kb_other_(philosophy) , as there is some kb_evidence_(law) of kb_a kb_trade relationship between the kb_roman_empire and kb_china . however , no direct connection can kb_beryllium demonstrated , and the similarity of the abacuses may kb_beryllium coincidental , both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per kb_hand . where the kb_roman_empire kb_rutherford_model ( like most kb_modern_history kb_korean_language and kb_japanese_language ) has 4 plus 1 bead per kb_decimal kb_place_of_articulation , the standard `` kb_suanpan '' has 5 plus kb_alkaline_earth_metal . ( incidentally , this allows use with kb_a kb_hexadecimal kb_numeral_system system , which was used for traditional kb_chinese_characters measures of weight . ) instead of running on wires as in the kb_chinese_characters , kb_korean_language , and kb_japanese_language models , the beads of kb_roman_empire kb_rutherford_model run in grooves , presumably making kb_arithmetic calculations much slower .another possible source of the `` kb_suanpan '' is kb_chinese_characters kb_counting_rods kb_rod_cell , which operated with kb_a kb_decimal but lacked the kb_concept of kb_0_(number) as kb_a kb_place_of_articulation holder . the kb_0_(number) was probably introduced to the kb_chinese_characters in the kb_tang_dynasty ( 618–907 ) when kb_air_travel in the kb_indian_ocean and the kb_middle_east kb_east_africa would have provided direct contact with kb_indian_subcontinent , allowing them to acquire the kb_concept of kb_0_(number) and the kb_decimal_pointthe normal method of kb_calculation in kb_ancient_rome , as in kb_greece , was by moving counters on kb_a smooth table . originally pebbles ( `` calculi '' ) were used . later , and in kb_middle_ages , jetons were manufactured . marked lines indicated units , fives , tens etc . as in the kb_roman_numeral system . this system of 'counter casting ' continued into the late kb_roman_empire and in kb_middle_ages , and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century . due to kb_pope_sylvester_ii ii 's reintroduction of the abacus with modifications , kb_it became widely used in kb_europe once again during the 11th century this abacus used beads on wires , unlike the traditional kb_roman_empire counting boards , which meant the abacus could kb_beryllium used much faster .writing in the 1st century bc , kb_horace refers to the kb_beeswax abacus , kb_a board covered with kb_a thin layer of kb_black_sea kb_beeswax on which columns and figures were kb_inscribed_figure using kb_a stylus .kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) example of kb_archaeology kb_evidence_(law) of the kb_roman_abacus , shown here in kb_reconstruction_era , dates to the 1st century kb_anno_domini . kb_it has eight kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or no beads in each . the groove marked kb_iodine indicates units , x tens , and kb_sulfate on up to millions . the beads in the shorter grooves denote fives –five units , five tens etc. , essentially in kb_a kb_bi-quinary_coded_decimal coded kb_decimal , related to the kb_roman_numerals . the short grooves on the kb_right-wing_politics may have been used for marking kb_roman_empire `` ounces '' ( i.e . kb_egyptian_fraction ) .the kb_decimal kb_grammatical_number system invented in kb_indian_subcontinent replaced the abacus in kb_western_europe .the `` kb_abhidharmakośabhāṣya '' of kb_vasubandhu ( 316-396 ) , kb_a kb_sanskrit kb_cold_working on kb_buddhist_philosophy , says that the second-century kb_council_of_europe kb_philosophy kb_vasumitrain kb_japanese_language , the abacus is called `` kb_soroban '' ( , lit . `` counting tray '' ) , imported from kb_china in the 14th century . kb_it was probably in use by the working kb_class_(biology) kb_a century or more before the kb_ruling_class kb_class_(biology) started , as the kb_class_(biology) kb_structure did not allow for devices used by the lower kb_class_(biology) to kb_beryllium kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome or used by the kb_ruling_class kb_class_(biology) . the 1/4 abacus , which is suited to kb_decimal kb_calculation popular appeared circa 1930 , and became widespread as the kb_japanese_language abandoned kb_hexadecimal weight kb_calculation which was still common in kb_china .today 's kb_japanese_language abacus is kb_a 1:4 kb_type_(biology) , four-bead abacus was introduced from kb_china in the muromachi era . kb_it adopts the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of the kb_upper_egypt deck kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) bead and the bottom four beads . the top bead on the kb_upper_egypt deck was equal to five and the bottom kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) is equal to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) like the kb_chinese_characters or kb_korean_language abacus , and the kb_decimal kb_grammatical_number can kb_beryllium expressed , kb_sulfate the abacus is kb_aircraft_design_process as kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) four abacus . the beads are always in the kb_shape of kb_a kb_diamond . the kb_quotient_ring kb_division_(mathematics) is generally used instead of the kb_division_(mathematics) method ; at the same kb_time_(magazine) , in kb_order_(biology) to make the kb_multiplication and kb_division_(mathematics) digits consistently use the kb_division_(mathematics) kb_multiplication . later , kb_japan had kb_a 3:5 abacus called天三算盤 , which is now the ize rongji kb_class_(set_theory) of shansi village in yamagata kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey . there were also had 2:5 beads abacus .with the four-bead abacus kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) , kb_it is also common to use kb_japanese_language abacus around the kb_world . there are also improved kb_japanese_language abacus in various places . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the japanese-made abacus made in kb_china is an aluminum frame kb_plastic bead abacus . the file is kb_next to the four beads , and the `` clearing '' kb_button_(control) , kb_news_media the clearing kb_button_(control) , immediately put the kb_upper_egypt bead to the kb_upper_egypt kb_positional_notation , the lower bead is dialed to the lower kb_positional_notation , immediately clearing , easy to use .the abacus is still manufactured in kb_japan today even with the proliferation , practicality , and affordability of pocket kb_electronic_computer calculators . the use of the kb_soroban is still taught in kb_japanese_language kb_primary_education schools as part of kb_mathematics , primarily as an kb_aid to faster kb_mental_health kb_calculation . using visual kb_imagery of kb_a kb_soroban , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) can arrive at the answer in the same kb_time_(magazine) as , or even faster than , is possible with kb_a kb_health instrument .the kb_chinese_characters abacus migrated from kb_china to kb_koreasome sources mention the use of an abacus called kb_a `` nepohualtzintzin '' in kb_ancient_history kb_aztec kb_albanian_culture . this mesoamerican abacus used kb_a 5-digit base-20 system .kb_the_word_(free_love) word nepōhualtzintzin comes from kb_nahuatl and kb_it is formed by the kb_semitic_root ; `` kb_[neon '' – kb_personal_property - ; `` pōhual '' or `` pōhualli '' – the account - ; and `` tzintzin '' – small similar kb_chemical_element . its complete kb_meaning_(linguistics) was taken as : counting with small similar kb_chemical_element by somebody . its use was taught in the kb_calmecac to the `` temalpouhqueh '' , kb_world_health_organization were students dedicated to kb_take the accounts of skies , from kb_childhood .the nepōhualtzintzin was divided in kb_2_(number) main parts separated by kb_a bar or intermediate cord . in the kb_left-wing_politics part there were four beads , which in the kb_first_trimester row have kb_unitary_state values ( 1 , kb_alkaline_earth_metal , 3 , and 4 ) , and in the kb_right-wing_politics side there are kb_triliteral beads with values of 5 , 10 , and 15 respectively . in kb_order_(biology) to know the kb_lightness of the respective beads of the kb_upper_egypt rows , kb_it is enough to multiply by 20 ( by each row ) , the kb_lightness of the corresponding account in the kb_first_trimester row .altogether , there were kb_boron_group rows with 7 beads in each kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) , which made up 91 beads in each nepōhualtzintzin . this was kb_a kb_base_(chemistry) kb_grammatical_number to kb_natural_language_understanding , 7 times kb_boron_group , kb_a close relation conceived between kb_natural_number kb_phenomenon , the kb_underworld and the kb_cycle_(graph_theory) of the heavens . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) nepōhualtzintzin ( 91 ) represented the kb_grammatical_number of days that kb_a kb_season of the year lasts , kb_2_(number) nepōhualtzitzin ( 182 ) is the kb_grammatical_number of days of the kb_corn 's cycle , from its sowing to its kb_harvest , kb_triliteral nepōhualtzintzin ( 273 ) is the kb_grammatical_number of days of kb_a baby 's kb_gestation , and four nepōhualtzintzin ( 364 ) completed kb_cyclic_compound and approximate kb_a year ( 1 days short ) . when translated into kb_modern_history kb_apollo_guidance_computer kb_arithmetic , the nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the kb_18-point_agreement in kb_floating_point point , which calculated stellar as kb_water_well as infinitesimal amounts with kb_absolute_morality kb_precision_(arithmetic) , meant that no round off was allowed .the rediscovery of the nepōhualtzintzin was due to the kb_mexican_people kb_civil_engineering kb_jacques-louis_david esparza kb_944_hidalgo , kb_world_health_organization in kb_histidine wanderings throughout kb_mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in kb_gold , jade , encrustations of kb_electron_shell , etc . there have also been found very kb_old_testament nepōhualtzintzin attributed to the kb_olmec kb_albanian_culture , and even some bracelets of mayan kb_evolution , as kb_water_well as kb_a diversity of kb_theory_of_forms and materials in kb_other_(philosophy) cultures .kb_lake_george_(new_york) i. sanchez , `` kb_arithmetic in kb_maya_civilization '' , austin-texas , 1961 found another kb_base_(chemistry) 5 , kb_base_(chemistry) 4 abacus in the kb_yucatán_peninsula kb_peninsula that also computed calendar kb_big_data . this was kb_a finger abacus , on kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_hand 0 , 1 , kb_alkaline_earth_metal , 3 , and 4 were used ; and on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand 0 , 1 , kb_alkaline_earth_metal and 3 were used . note the use of kb_0_(number) at kb_operation_barbarossa beginning and end of the kb_2_(number) kb_cycle_(graph_theory) . sanchez worked with kb_sylvanus_morley morley , kb_a noted mayanist .the kb_quipu of the incas was kb_a system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical kb_big_data , like advanced tally sticks – but not used to perform calculations . calculations were carried out using kb_a kb_yupana ( kb_quechua_languages for `` counting kb_tool '' ; kb_episcopal_see kb_female_body_shape ) which was still in use after the kb_umayyad_conquest_of_hispania of kb_peru . the working kb_principle_(chemistry) of kb_a kb_yupana is unknown , but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical kb_basis_(linear_algebra) of these instruments was kb_anatolian_hypothesis by kb_italian_language kb_mathematician nicolino kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann pasquale . by comparing the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of several yupanas , researchers found that calculations were based using the kb_fibonacci_sequence sequencethe kb_russian_alphabet abacus , the `` schoty '' ( счёты ) , usually has kb_a kb_single_bond slanted deck , with ten beads on each wire ( except kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) wire , usually positioned near the kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) , with four beads for quarter-ruble kb_egyptian_fraction ) . older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks , which were minted until 1916. the kb_russian_alphabet abacus is often used kb_vertical_direction , with wires from kb_left_to_right kb_right-wing_politics in the manner of kb_a book . the wires are usually bowed to kb_bulge_(astronomy) upward in the center , to keep the beads pinned to either of the kb_2_(number) sides . kb_it is cleared when all the beads are moved to the kb_right-wing_politics . during manipulation , beads are moved to the kb_left-wing_politics . for easy viewing , the middle kb_alkaline_earth_metal beads on each wire ( the 5th and 6th bead ) usually are of kb_a different kb_color from the kb_other_(philosophy) eight beads . likewise , the kb_left-wing_politics bead of the thousands wire ( and the million wire , if present ) may have kb_a different kb_color .as kb_a kb_simple_polygon , cheap and reliable kb_analyzer , the kb_russian_alphabet abacus was in use in all shops and kb_market_(economics) throughout the kb_commonwealth_of_independent_states kb_soviet_union , and the usage of kb_it was taught in most schools until the 1990s . even the 1874 invention of kb_mechanical_calculator , kb_odhner_arithmometer arithmometer , had not replaced them in kb_russian_empire and likewise the kb_mass_production of felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the kb_soviet_union . the kb_russian_alphabet abacus began to lose popularity only after the kb_mass_production of kb_pocket_calculator had started in the kb_soviet_union in 1974. today kb_it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld kb_calculator .the kb_russian_alphabet abacus was brought to kb_france around 1820 by the kb_mathematician kb_jean-victor_poncelet poncelet , kb_world_health_organization served in kb_napoleon 's kb_british_army and had been kb_a prisoner of kb_war in kb_russian_empire . the abacus had fallen out of use in kb_western_europe in the 16th century with the rise of kb_decimal notation and algorismic methods . to poncelet 's kb_france contemporaries , kb_it was something kb_new_world . poncelet used kb_it , not for any kb_applied_science purpose , but as kb_a teaching and demonstration kb_aid . the kb_ottoman_empire and the kb_armenian_languagearound the kb_world , abacuses have been used in pre-schools and kb_elementary_school schools as an kb_aid in teaching the kb_numeral_system system and kb_arithmetic .in kb_western_world , kb_a bead frame similar to the kb_russian_alphabet abacus but with straight wires and kb_a vertical frame has been common ( kb_episcopal_see image ) . kb_it is still often seen as kb_a kb_plastic or wooden toy .the wire frame may kb_beryllium used either with positional notation like kb_other_(philosophy) abacuses ( thus the 10-wire version may represent kb_grammatical_number up to 9,999,999,999 ) , or each bead may represent kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_units_of_measurement ( kb_sulfate that e.g . 74 can kb_beryllium represented by shifting all beads on 7 wires and 4 beads on the 8th wire , kb_sulfate kb_grammatical_number up to 100 may kb_beryllium represented ) . in the bead frame shown , the gap between the 5th and 6th wire , corresponding to the kb_color change between the 5th and the 6th bead on each wire , suggests the latter use .the red-and-white abacus is used in contemporary kb_primary_education schools for kb_a wide range of number-related lessons . the twenty bead version , referred to by its kb_dutch_language kb_toponymy `` rekenrek '' ( `` calculating frame '' ) , is often used , sometimes on kb_a string of beads , sometimes on kb_a kb_rigid_airship framework .by kb_learning how to calculate with abacus , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) can improve kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's kb_mental_health kb_calculation which becomes faster and more accurate in doing kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number calculations . kb_mental_abacus kb_mental_health kb_calculation ( amc ) was kb_derived_trait from the abacus which means doing kb_calculation , including kb_addition , kb_subtraction , kb_multiplication , and kb_division_(mathematics) , in kb_mind with an imagined abacus . kb_it is kb_a kb_high-level_programming_language cognitive skill that run through calculations with an effective kb_algorithm . kb_people_(american_magazine) doing long-term amc kb_military_education_and_training show higher numerical kb_memory capacity and have more effectively connected neural pathways . they are able to retrieve kb_memory to deal with kb_complex_number processes to calculate . the kb_fish_processing of amc involves both the kb_visuospatial_function and visuomotor kb_fish_processing which generate the visual abacus and perform the kb_movement_(sign_language) of the imaginary bead . since the only kb_object_(philosophy) needed to kb_beryllium remembered is the finial kb_positional_notation of beads , kb_it takes less kb_memory and less kb_computation kb_time_(magazine) .an adapted abacus , invented by tim cranmer , called kb_a cranmer abacus is still commonly used by individuals kb_world_health_organization are kb_blindness . kb_a piece of kb_hardness fabric or kb_rubber is placed behind the beads kb_sulfate that they do not move inadvertently . this keeps the beads in kb_place_of_articulation while the users kb_sentience or manipulate them . they use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions kb_multiplication , kb_division_(mathematics) , kb_addition , kb_subtraction , kb_square_root and kb_cube_root kb_root_of_a_function .although kb_blindness students have benefited from talking calculators , the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early kb_grade_(education) , both in kb_state_school schools and kb_state_of_matter schools for the kb_blindness . kb_blindness students also complete mathematical assignments using kb_a braille-writer and kb_nemeth_braille kb_code ( kb_a kb_type_(biology) of kb_braille kb_code for kb_mathematics ) but kb_prespa_lake kb_multiplication and kb_long_divisionthe kb_binary_number abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate kb_grammatical_number . the abacus shows how kb_grammatical_number ,

forming kb_a kb_covalent_bond with an kb_lone_pair ( kb_a kb_lewis_acid ) .the kb_first_trimester category of acids is the kb_proton donors or kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted acids . in the special case of kb_aqueous_solutions solutions , kb_proton donors kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_hydronium_ion kb_water and are known as kb_acid-base_reaction#arrhenius_theory acids . kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted and kb_thomas_martin_lowry generalized the arrhenius kb_theory to include non-aqueous solvents . kb_a kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted or arrhenius kb_acid usually contains kb_a kb_hydrogen_atom bonded to kb_a kb_chemical_structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of kb_hydrogen .aqueous kb_acid-base_reaction#arrhenius_theory acids have kb_characteristic_(algebra) kb_chemical_property which provide kb_a practical description of an kb_acid . acids kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_aqueous_solutions solutions with kb_a sour taste , can kb_turn_(geometry) blue kb_litmus kb_red_fox , and react with kb_base_(chemistry) and certain metals ( like kb_calcium ) to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_salt_(chemistry) . kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_acid '' is kb_derived_trait from the kb_latin `` acidus/acēre '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` sour '' . an kb_aqueous_solution kb_solid_solution of an kb_acid has kb_a kb_ph less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid ' ( as in 'dissolved in kb_acid ' ) , while the strict kb_definition refers only to the kb_solution . kb_a lower kb_ph means kb_a higher acidity , and thus kb_a higher kb_concentration of kb_hydron_(chemistry) kb_ions in the kb_solid_solution . kb_chemical_substance or substances having the kb_property of an kb_acid are said to kb_beryllium acidic .common aqueous acids include kb_hydrochloric_acid kb_acid ( kb_a kb_solid_solution of kb_hydrogen_chloride which is found in kb_gastric_acid kb_acid in the kb_stomach and activates kb_digestive_enzymes ) , acetic kb_acid ( kb_vinegar is kb_a dilute kb_aqueous_solution kb_solid_solution of this kb_liquid ) , kb_sulfuric_acid ( used in kb_car_batteries ) , and citric kb_acid ( found in citrus fruits ) . as these examples show , acids ( in the colloquial kb_word_sense ) can kb_beryllium solutions or pure substances , and can kb_beryllium kb_derived_trait from acids ( in the strict kb_word_sense ) that are solids , liquids , or gases . kb_strong_nuclear_force acids and some concentrated weak acids are kb_corrosive_substance , but there are kb_non-linear_writing such as carboranes and kb_boric_acid kb_acid .the kb_second category of acids are kb_lewis_acids_and_bases , which kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_covalent_bond with an kb_lone_pair . an example is kb_boron_trifluoride ( bf ) , whose kb_boron kb_atom has kb_a vacant kb_atomic_orbital which can kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_covalent_bond by sharing kb_a kb_lone_pair pair of electrons on an kb_atom in kb_a kb_base_(chemistry) , for example the kb_nitrogen kb_atom in kb_ammonia ( nh ) . kb_meriwether_lewis considered this as kb_a generalization of the kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted kb_definition , kb_sulfate that an kb_acid is kb_a kb_protein_sequencing kb_species that accepts kb_electron pairs either directly `` or '' by releasing kb_protons ( kb_hydrogen ) into the kb_solid_solution , which then accept kb_electron pairs . however , kb_hydrogen_chloride , acetic kb_acid , and most kb_other_(philosophy) brønsted-lowry acids can not kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_covalent_bond with an kb_lone_pair and are therefore not kb_lewis_acids_and_bases . conversely , many kb_lewis_acids_and_bases are not arrhenius or brønsted-lowry acids . in kb_modern_history terminology , an `` kb_acid '' is implicitly kb_a kb_brønsted–lowry_acid–base_theory and not kb_a kb_lewis_acid , since chemists almost always refer to kb_a kb_lewis_acid explicitly as `` kb_a kb_lewis_acid '' .kb_modern_history definitions are concerned with the fundamental kb_protein_sequencing reactions common to all acids .most acids encountered in everyday kb_life_(magazine) are kb_aqueous_solutions solutions , or can kb_beryllium kb_fall_of_communism_in_albania in kb_water , kb_sulfate the arrhenius and brønsted-lowry definitions are the most relevant .the brønsted-lowry kb_definition is the most widely used kb_definition ; unless otherwise specified , acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of kb_a kb_proton ( kb_hydrogen ) from an kb_acid to kb_a kb_base_(chemistry) .kb_hydronium kb_ions are acids according to all kb_triliteral definitions . although alcohols and amines can kb_beryllium brønsted-lowry acids , they can also kb_function_(biology) as kb_meriwether_lewis kb_base_(chemistry)the kb_sweden chemist kb_svante_arrhenius arrhenius attributed the kb_chemical_property of acidity to kb_hydron_(chemistry) ( kb_hydrogen ) or kb_protons in 1884. an arrhenius kb_acid is kb_a kb_matter that , when added to kb_water , increases the kb_concentration of kb_hydrogen kb_ions in the kb_water . note that chemists often write kb_hydrogen ( `` aq '' ) and refer to the kb_hydrogen_ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free kb_hydrogen kb_atomic_nucleus , kb_a kb_proton , does not exist alone in kb_water , kb_it exists as the kb_hydronium_ion , kb_water . thus , an arrhenius kb_acid can also kb_beryllium described as kb_a kb_matter that increases the kb_concentration of kb_hydronium kb_ions when added to kb_water . examples include kb_molecular_genetics substances such as hcl and acetic kb_acid .an arrhenius kb_base_(chemistry) , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , is kb_a kb_matter which increases the kb_concentration of kb_lithium_hydroxide ( kb_hydroxide ) kb_ions when kb_fall_of_communism_in_albania in kb_water . this decreases the kb_concentration of kb_hydronium because the kb_ions react to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_water molecules :kb_water + kb_hydroxide ⇌ kb_water + kb_waterdue to this kb_chemical_equilibrium , any increase in the kb_concentration of kb_hydronium is accompanied by kb_a decrease in the kb_concentration of kb_lithium_hydroxide . thus , an arrhenius kb_acid could also kb_beryllium said to kb_beryllium kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) that decreases kb_lithium_hydroxide kb_concentration , while an arrhenius kb_base_(chemistry) increases kb_it .in an acidic kb_solid_solution , the kb_concentration of kb_hydronium kb_ions is greater than 10 kb_mole_(unit)while the arrhenius kb_concept is useful for describing many reactions , kb_it is also quite limited in its kb_scope_(mouthwash) . in 1923 chemists kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted nicolaus kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted and kb_thomas_martin_lowry kb_thomas_martin_lowry independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of kb_a kb_proton . kb_a brønsted-lowry kb_acid ( or simply kb_brønsted–lowry_acid–base_theory ) is kb_a kb_species that donates kb_a kb_proton to kb_a brønsted-lowry kb_base_(chemistry) . brønsted-lowry acid-base kb_theory has several advantages over arrhenius kb_theory . consider the following reactions of acetic kb_acid ( chcooh ) , the kb_organic_acid that gives kb_vinegar its kb_characteristic_(algebra) taste :both kb_theories easily describe the kb_first_trimester reaction : chcooh acts as an arrhenius kb_acid because kb_it acts as kb_a source of kb_water when kb_fall_of_communism_in_albania in kb_water , and kb_it acts as kb_a kb_brønsted–lowry_acid–base_theory by donating kb_a kb_proton to kb_water . in the kb_second example chcooh undergoes the same transformation , in this case donating kb_a kb_proton to kb_ammonia ( nh ) , but does not relate to the arrhenius kb_definition of an kb_acid because the reaction does not produce kb_hydronium . nevertheless , chcooh is both an arrhenius and kb_a brønsted-lowry kb_acid .brønsted-lowry kb_theory can kb_beryllium used to describe reactions of kb_molecule in nonaqueous kb_solid_solution or the kb_gas kb_phase_(matter) . kb_hydrogen_chloride ( hcl ) and kb_ammonia combine under several different conditions to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_ammonium_chloride , nhcl . in kb_aqueous_solution kb_solid_solution hcl behaves as kb_hydrochloric_acid kb_acid and exists as kb_hydronium and kb_chloride kb_ions . the following reactions illustrate the limitations of arrhenius 's kb_definition :as with the acetic kb_acid reactions , both definitions kb_cold_working for the kb_first_trimester example , where kb_water is the kb_solvent and kb_hydronium_ion is formed by the hcl kb_solution . the kb_next kb_2_(number) reactions do not involve the formation of kb_ions but are still proton-transfer reactions . in the kb_second reaction kb_hydrogen_chloride and kb_ammonia ( kb_fall_of_communism_in_albania in kb_benzene ) react to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_solid kb_ammonium_chloride in kb_a kb_benzene kb_solvent and in the kb_ipad_(third_generation) gaseous hcl and nh combine to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_solid .kb_a kb_ipad_(third_generation) , only marginally related kb_concept was kb_anatolian_hypothesis in 1923 by kb_gilbert_n._lewis kb_noun kb_meriwether_lewis , which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve kb_a kb_proton transfer . kb_a kb_lewis_acid is kb_a kb_species that accepts kb_a pair of electrons from another kb_species ; in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_lexical_semantics , kb_it is an kb_lone_pair acceptor . kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted acid-base reactions are kb_proton transfer reactions while kb_meriwether_lewis acid-base reactions are kb_lone_pair transfers . many kb_lewis_acids_and_bases are not brønsted-lowry acids . kb_contrast_(vision) how the following reactions are described in terms of kb_acid-base_chemistry kb_chemistry :in the kb_first_trimester reaction kb_a kb_fluoride , kb_fluorine , gives up an kb_lone_pair to kb_boron_trifluoride to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_decay_product kb_tetrafluoroborate . kb_fluoride `` loses '' kb_a pair of valence electrons because the electrons shared in the b—f kb_chemical_bond are located in the kb_region of kb_space between the kb_2_(number) kb_atomic_nucleus and are therefore more distant from the kb_fluoride kb_atomic_nucleus than they are in the lone kb_fluoride . bf is kb_a kb_lewis_acid because kb_it accepts the kb_lone_pair from kb_fluoride . this reaction can not kb_beryllium described in terms of kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted kb_theory because there is no kb_proton transfer . the kb_second reaction can kb_beryllium described using either kb_theory . kb_a kb_proton is transferred from an unspecified kb_brønsted–lowry_acid–base_theory to kb_ammonia , kb_a kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted kb_base_(chemistry) ; alternatively , kb_ammonia acts as kb_a kb_lewis_base and transfers kb_a kb_lone_pair pair of electrons to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_a kb_chemical_bond with kb_a kb_hydrogen_ion . the kb_species that gains the kb_lone_pair is the kb_lewis_acid ; for example , the kb_oxygen kb_atom in kb_water gains kb_a pair of electrons when kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the h—o bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the kb_chemical_bond become localized on kb_oxygen . depending on the kb_context_(language_use) , kb_a kb_lewis_acid may also kb_beryllium described as an kb_nitrogen_tetroxide or an kb_electrophile . kb_organic_chemistry kb_johannes_nicolaus_brønsted acids , such as acetic , citric , or oxalic kb_acid , are not kb_lewis_acids_and_bases . they dissociate in kb_water to produce kb_a kb_lewis_acid , kb_hydrogen , but at the same kb_time_(magazine) also yield an equal amount of kb_a kb_lewis_base ( kb_acetate , kb_citrate , or kb_oxalate , respectively , for the acids mentioned ) . few , if any , of the acids discussed in the following are kb_lewis_acids_and_bases .reactions of acids are often generalized in the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism ha kb_hydrogen + kb_a , where ha represents the kb_acid and kb_a is the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) . this reaction is referred to as protolysis . the kb_protonated kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism ( ha ) of an kb_acid is also sometimes referred to as the free kb_acid .acid-base conjugate pairs differ by kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton , and can kb_beryllium interconverted by the kb_addition or removal of kb_a kb_proton ( kb_protonation and kb_deprotonation , respectively ) . note that the kb_acid can kb_beryllium the kb_electric_charge kb_species and the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) can kb_beryllium kb_neutral_solution in which case the generalized reaction scheme could kb_beryllium written as ha kb_hydrogen + a. in kb_solid_solution there exists an kb_chemical_equilibrium between the kb_acid and its kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) . the kb_equilibrium_constant `` kb_potassium '' is an expression of the kb_chemical_equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the kb_ions in kb_solid_solution . brackets indicate kb_concentration , such that [ kb_water ] means `` the kb_concentration of kb_water '' . the kb_acid_dissociation_constant constant `` kb_potassium '' is generally used in the kb_context_(language_use) of acid-base reactions . the numerical kb_lightness of `` kb_potassium '' is equal to the kb_decay_product of the concentrations of the products divided by the kb_concentration of the reactants , where the reactant is the kb_acid ( ha ) and the products are the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) and kb_hydrogen .the stronger of kb_2_(number) acids kb_will_and_testament have kb_a higher `` kb_potassium '' than the weaker kb_acid ; the kb_ratio of kb_hydron_(chemistry) to kb_acid kb_will_and_testament kb_beryllium higher for the stronger kb_acid as the stronger kb_acid has kb_a greater tendency to lose its kb_proton . because the range of possible values for `` kb_potassium '' spans many kb_order_(biology) of kb_apparent_magnitude , kb_a more manageable constant , p '' kb_potassium '' is more frequently used , where p '' kb_potassium '' = −log `` kb_potassium '' . stronger acids have kb_a smaller p '' kb_potassium '' than weaker acids . experimentally determined p '' kb_potassium '' at 25 °c in kb_aqueous_solution kb_solid_solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference kb_material .in the kb_classical_conditioning naming system , acids are kb_english_alphabet#letter_names according to their anions . that kb_ionic_crystal kb_suffix is dropped and replaced with kb_a kb_new_world kb_suffix ( and sometimes kb_prefix ) , according to the table kb_#ecclesiastical_history .for example , hcl has kb_chloride as its kb_anion , kb_sulfate the -ide kb_suffix makes kb_it kb_take the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_hydrochloric_acid kb_acid . in the kb_international_union_of_pure_and_applied_chemistry naming system , `` aqueous '' is simply added to the kb_toponymy of the kb_ionic_compound . thus , for kb_hydrogen_chloride , the kb_international_union_of_pure_and_applied_chemistry kb_toponymy would kb_beryllium aqueous kb_hydrogen_chloride . the kb_prefix `` hydro- '' is added only if the kb_acid is made up of just kb_hydrogen and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_other_(philosophy) kb_chemical_element .kb_classical_conditioning naming system :the kb_strength_of_materials of an kb_acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose kb_a kb_proton . kb_a kb_acid_strength is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) that completely dissociates in kb_water ; in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_lexical_semantics , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_mole_(unit) of kb_a kb_acid_strength ha kb_dissolve_(filmmaking) in kb_water yielding kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_mole_(unit) of kb_hydrogen and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_mole_(unit) of the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) , kb_a , and kb_none_(liturgy) of the kb_protonated kb_acid ha . in kb_contrast_(vision) , kb_a kb_weak_acid kb_acid only partially dissociates and at kb_chemical_equilibrium both the kb_acid and the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) are in kb_solid_solution . examples of kb_strong_nuclear_force acids are kb_hydrochloric_acid kb_acid ( hcl ) , kb_hydroiodic_acid kb_acid ( hi ) , kb_hydrobromic_acid kb_acid ( hbr ) , kb_perchloric_acid kb_acid ( hclo ) , kb_nitric_acid kb_acid ( hno ) and kb_sulfuric_acid ( hso ) . in kb_water each of these essentially ionizes 100 % . the stronger an kb_acid is , the more easily kb_it loses kb_a kb_proton , h. kb_2_(number) kb_key_(cryptography) factors that contribute to the ease of kb_deprotonation are the kb_chemical_polarity of the h—a kb_chemical_bond and the size of kb_atom kb_a , which determines the kb_strength_of_materials of the h—a kb_chemical_bond . kb_acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) .stronger acids have kb_a larger `` kb_potassium '' and kb_a more kb_negative_number p '' kb_potassium '' than weaker acids .sulfonic acids , which are kb_organic_chemistry oxyacids , are kb_a kb_class_(biology) of kb_strong_nuclear_force acids . kb_a common example is kb_toluenesulfonic_acid kb_acid ( tosylic kb_acid ) . unlike kb_sulfuric_acid itself , sulfonic acids can kb_beryllium solids . in kb_fact , kb_polystyrene functionalized into kb_polystyrene sulfonate is kb_a kb_solid strongly acidic kb_plastic that is filterable .superacids are acids stronger than 100 % kb_sulfuric_acid . examples of superacids are kb_fluoroantimonic_acid kb_acid , kb_magic_acid and kb_perchloric_acid kb_acid . superacids can permanently protonate kb_water to give kb_ionic_crystal , crystalline kb_hydronium `` kb_salt_(chemistry) '' . they can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations .while `` kb_potassium '' measures the kb_strength_of_materials of an kb_acid kb_chemical_compound , the kb_strength_of_materials of an aqueous kb_acid kb_solid_solution is measured by kb_ph , which is an indication of the kb_concentration of kb_hydronium in the kb_solid_solution . the kb_ph of kb_a kb_simple_polygon kb_solid_solution of an kb_acid kb_chemical_compound in kb_water is determined by the dilution of the kb_chemical_compound and the kb_chemical_compound 's `` kb_potassium '' .monoprotic acids , also known as monobasic acids , are those acids that are able to donate kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton per kb_molecule during the process of kb_dissociation_(chemistry) ( sometimes called kb_ionization ) as shown kb_#ecclesiastical_history ( symbolized by ha ) :common examples of monoprotic acids in kb_mineral_reserve acids include kb_hydrochloric_acid kb_acid ( hcl ) and kb_nitric_acid kb_acid ( hno ) . on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , for kb_organic_acids the kb_terminology mainly indicates the presence of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_carboxylic_acid kb_acid kb_group_(periodic_table) and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic kb_acid . examples in kb_organic_acids include kb_formic_acid kb_acid ( hcooh ) , acetic kb_acid ( chcooh ) and kb_benzoic_acid kb_acid ( chcooh ) .polyprotic acids , also known as polybasic acids , are able to donate more than kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton per kb_acid kb_molecule , in kb_contrast_(vision) to monoprotic acids that only donate kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton per kb_molecule . specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names , such as diprotic ( or dibasic ) kb_acid ( kb_2_(number) potential kb_protons to donate ) , and triprotic ( or tribasic ) kb_acid ( kb_triliteral potential kb_protons to donate ) .kb_a diprotic kb_acid ( here symbolized by ha ) can undergo kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or kb_2_(number) dissociations depending on the kb_ph . each kb_dissociation_(chemistry) has its own kb_dissociation_(chemistry) constant , kb_potassium and kb_potassium .the kb_first_trimester kb_dissociation_(chemistry) constant is typically greater than the kb_second ; i.e. , `` kb_potassium '' > `` kb_potassium '' . for example , kb_sulfuric_acid ( hso ) can donate kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_bisulfate kb_anion ( hso ) , for which `` kb_potassium '' is very kb_prespa_lake ; then kb_it can donate kb_a kb_second kb_proton to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_sulfate kb_anion ( kb_sulfate ) , wherein the `` kb_potassium '' is intermediate kb_strength_of_materials . the kb_prespa_lake `` kb_potassium '' for the kb_first_trimester kb_dissociation_(chemistry) makes kb_sulfuric_acid kb_a kb_acid_strength . in kb_a similar manner , the weak unstable kb_carbonic_acid kb_acid can lose kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_proton to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_bicarbonate kb_anion and lose kb_a kb_second to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism kb_lithium_carbonate kb_anion ( kb_cobalt ) . both `` kb_potassium '' values are small , but `` kb_potassium '' > `` kb_potassium '' .kb_a triprotic kb_acid ( ha ) can undergo kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) , kb_2_(number) , or kb_triliteral dissociations and has kb_triliteral kb_dissociation_(chemistry) constants , where `` kb_potassium '' > `` kb_potassium '' > `` kb_potassium '' .an kb_inorganic example of kb_a triprotic kb_acid is orthophosphoric kb_acid ( hpo ) , usually just called kb_phosphoric_acid kb_acid . all kb_triliteral kb_protons can kb_beryllium successively kb_lost_film to yield hpo , then hpo , and finally kb_po_(river) , the orthophosphate kb_ion , usually just called kb_phosphate . even though the positions of the kb_triliteral kb_protons on the original kb_phosphoric_acid kb_acid kb_molecule are kb_cognate , the successive `` kb_potassium '' values differ since kb_it is energetically less favorable to lose kb_a kb_proton if the kb_conjugate_acid kb_base_(chemistry) is more negatively kb_electric_charge . an kb_organic_chemistry example of kb_a triprotic kb_acid is citric kb_acid , which can successively lose kb_triliteral kb_protons to finally kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism the kb_citrate kb_ion .although the subsequent loss of each kb_hydrogen_ion is less favorable , all of the conjugate kb_base_(chemistry) are present in kb_solid_solution . the fractional kb_concentration , `` α '' ( kb_alpha_(letter) ) , for each kb_species can kb_beryllium calculated . for example , kb_a kb_genus diprotic kb_acid kb_will_and_testament generate 3 kb_species in kb_solid_solution : ha , ha , and a. the fractional concentrations can kb_beryllium calculated as kb_#ecclesiastical_history when given either the kb_ph ( which can kb_beryllium converted to the [ kb_hydrogen ] ) or the concentrations of the kb_acid with all its conjugate kb_base_(chemistry) :kb_a plot of these fractional concentrations against kb_ph , for given `` kb_potassium '' and `` kb_potassium '' , is known as kb_a kb_bjerrum_plot plotcategory : acid–base kb_chemistrykb_asphalt , also known as kb_asphalt ( , ) , is kb_a sticky , kb_black_sea , and highly kb_viscosity kb_liquid or semi-solid kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_petroleum . kb_it may kb_beryllium found in kb_natural_number kb_deposit_(geology) or may kb_beryllium kb_a refined kb_decay_product , and is kb_axon#classification as kb_a kb_pitch_(flight) . before the 20th century , the kb_terminology asphaltum was also used . kb_the_word_(free_love) word is kb_derived_trait from the kb_ancient_greek ἄσφαλτος `` ásphaltos '' .the kb_primary_education use ( 70 % ) of kb_asphalt is in kb_road_surface kb_construction , where kb_it is used as the glue or kb_binder_(material) mixed with kb_construction_aggregate kb_subatomic_particle to create kb_asphalt_concrete . its kb_other_(philosophy) main uses are for kb_bituminous_waterproofing kb_waterproofing products , including production of kb_roofing_felt felt and for sealing flat roofs .the terms `` kb_asphalt '' and `` kb_asphalt '' are often used interchangeably to kb_mean both kb_natural_number and manufactured kb_theory_of_forms of the kb_matter . in kb_american_english , `` kb_asphalt '' ( or `` kb_asphalt kb_cement '' ) is commonly used for kb_a refined residue from the kb_distillation process of selected crude kb_cooking_oil . outside the united kb_sovereign_state , the kb_decay_product is often called `` kb_asphalt '' , and geologists worldwide often prefer the kb_terminology for the naturally occurring kb_variety_(magazine) . common colloquial usage often refers to various kb_theory_of_forms of kb_asphalt as `` kb_tar '' , as in the kb_toponymy of the kb_la_brea_tar_pits brea kb_tar pits .naturally occurring kb_asphalt is sometimes specified by the kb_terminology `` crude kb_asphalt '' . its kb_viscosity is similar to that of cold kb_molasses while the kb_material obtained from the kb_fractional_distillation kb_distillation of kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil boiling at is sometimes referred to as `` refined kb_asphalt '' . the kb_canadians kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands of kb_alberta has most of the kb_world 's reserves of kb_natural_number kb_asphalt in the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands , which cover , an kb_area larger than kb_kingdom_of_england .kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_asphalt '' is kb_derived_trait from the late kb_middle_english kb_australian_english , in kb_turn_(geometry) from kb_france `` asphalte '' , based on kb_late_latin kb_latin `` asphalton '' , `` asphaltum '' , which is the kb_latinisation_(literature) of the kb_ancient_greek ἄσφαλτος ( `` ásphaltos '' , `` ásphalton '' ) , kb_a word kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` asphalt/bitumen/pitch '' , which perhaps derives from ἀ- , `` without '' and σφάλλω ( `` sfallō '' ) , `` make fall '' . the kb_first_trimester use of kb_asphalt by the ancients was in the kb_nature of kb_a kb_cement for securing or joining together various kb_object_relations_theory , and kb_it thus seems likely that the kb_toponymy itself was kb_keyboard_expression of this kb_application_(computing) . specifically , kb_herodotus mentioned that kb_asphalt was brought to kb_babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall . from the kb_ancient_greek , kb_the_word_(free_love) word passed into kb_late_latin kb_latin , and thence into kb_france ( `` asphalte '' ) and kb_australian_english ( `` asphaltum '' and `` kb_asphalt '' ) . in kb_france , the kb_terminology `` asphalte '' is used for naturally occurring asphalt-soaked kb_limestone kb_deposit_(geology) , and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater kb_asphalt content than the `` asphaltic kb_concrete '' used to pave roads .the expression `` kb_asphalt '' originated in the kb_sanskrit kb_lexical_semantics `` jatu '' , kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_pitch_(flight) '' , and `` jatu-krit '' , kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_pitch_(flight) creating '' or `` kb_pitch_(flight) producing '' ( referring to kb_temperate_coniferous_forest or resinous kb_trees ) . the kb_latin kb_cognate is claimed by some to kb_beryllium originally `` gwitu-men '' ( pertaining to kb_pitch_(flight) ) , and by others , `` pixtumens '' ( exuding or bubbling kb_pitch_(flight) ) , which was subsequently kb_clipping_(morphology) to `` kb_asphalt '' , thence passing via kb_france into kb_australian_english . from the same kb_root_of_a_function is kb_derived_trait the kb_anglo-saxons word `` cwidu '' ( mastix ) , the kb_german_language word `` kitt '' ( kb_cement or kb_mastic_(plant_resin) ) and the kb_old_norse word `` kvada '' .in kb_british_english , `` kb_asphalt '' is used instead of `` kb_asphalt '' . kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_asphalt '' is instead used to refer to kb_asphalt_concrete , kb_a kb_mixture of kb_construction_aggregate and kb_asphalt itself ( also called `` kb_tarmacadam '' in common parlance ) . kb_asphalt mixed with kb_clay was usually called `` asphaltum '' , but the kb_terminology is less commonly used today .in kb_australian_english kb_australian_english , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_asphalt '' is used to describe kb_a mix of kb_construction_aggregate . `` kb_asphalt '' refers to the kb_liquid kb_derived_trait from the heavy-residues from kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil kb_distillation .in kb_american_english , `` kb_asphalt '' is kb_cognate to the kb_kingdom_of_great_britain `` kb_asphalt '' . however , `` kb_asphalt '' is also commonly used as kb_a kb_clipping_(morphology) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of `` kb_asphalt_concrete '' ( therefore kb_cognate to the kb_kingdom_of_great_britain `` kb_asphalt '' or `` kb_tarmacadam '' ) .in kb_canadian_english , kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_asphalt '' is used to refer to the vast kb_canadians kb_deposit_(geology) of extremely heavy kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , while `` kb_asphalt '' is used for the kb_oil_refinery kb_decay_product . diluted kb_asphalt ( diluted with kb_naphtha to make kb_it kb_flow_(psychology) in pipelines ) is known as `` kb_dilbit '' in the kb_canadians kb_petroleum kb_industry , while kb_asphalt `` kb_upgrader '' to kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil is known as `` syncrude '' , and syncrude blended with kb_asphalt is called `` kb_synbit '' .`` kb_asphalt '' is still the preferred kb_geological kb_terminology for naturally occurring kb_deposit_(geology) of the kb_solid or semi-solid kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_petroleum . `` bituminous kb_rock_of_gibraltar '' is kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_sandstone impregnated with kb_asphalt . the kb_oil_sands of kb_alberta , kb_canada are kb_a similar kb_material .neither of the terms `` kb_asphalt '' or `` kb_asphalt '' should kb_beryllium confused with kb_tar or kb_coal_tars . kb_tar is the thick kb_liquid kb_decay_product of the dry kb_distillation and kb_pyrolysis of kb_organic_chemistry kb_hydrocarbons primarily sourced from vegetation masses , whether fossilized as with kb_coal , or freshly harvested . the majority of kb_asphalt , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , was formed naturally when vast quantities of kb_organic_chemistry kb_animal materials were deposited by kb_water and buried hundreds of metres deep at the kb_diagenesis point , where the disorganized fatty kb_hydrocarbon molecules joined together in kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) chains in the absence of kb_oxygen . kb_asphalt occurs as kb_a kb_solid or highly kb_viscosity kb_liquid . kb_it may even kb_beryllium mixed in with kb_coal kb_deposit_(geology) . kb_asphalt , and kb_coal using the kb_bergius_process process , can kb_beryllium refined into petrols such as kb_gasoline , and kb_asphalt may kb_beryllium distilled into kb_tar , not the kb_other_(philosophy) way around .the components of kb_asphalt include four main classes of kb_chemical_compound :the naphthene aromatics and kb_polar_molecule aromatics are typically the majority components . most kb_natural_number bitumens also contain organosulfur kb_chemical_compound , resulting in an overall kb_sulfur content of up to 4 % . kb_nickel and kb_vanadium are found at < 10 kb_part_per_million per million , as is typical of some kb_petroleum .the kb_matter is kb_solubility in kb_carbon_disulfide . kb_it is commonly modelled as kb_a kb_colloid , with asphaltenes as the kb_continuous_function kb_phase_(matter) . `` kb_it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of kb_asphalt , because the kb_grammatical_number of molecules with different kb_chemical_structure is extremely kb_prespa_lake '' .kb_asphalt may kb_beryllium confused with kb_coal_tar , which is kb_a visually similar kb_black_sea , kb_thermoplastic kb_material produced by the kb_destructive_distillation kb_distillation of kb_coal . during the early and mid-20th century , when kb_town_gas kb_gas was produced , kb_coal_tar was kb_a readily kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance byproduct and extensively used as the kb_binder_(material) for road kb_construction_aggregate . the kb_addition of kb_coal_tar to kb_macadam roads kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_tarmacadam '' , which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials . however , since the 1970s , when kb_natural_gas succeeded kb_town_gas kb_gas , kb_asphalt has completely overtaken the use of kb_coal_tar in these applications . kb_other_(philosophy) examples of this kb_confusion include the kb_la_brea_tar_pits brea kb_tar pits and the kb_canadians kb_oil_sands , both of which actually contain kb_natural_number kb_asphalt rather than kb_tar . `` kb_pitch_(flight) '' is another kb_terminology sometimes informally used at times to refer to kb_asphalt , as in kb_pitch_lake .for kb_economic_anthropology and kb_other_(philosophy) reasons , kb_asphalt is sometimes sold combined with kb_other_(philosophy) materials , often without kb_being labeled as anything kb_other_(philosophy) than simply `` kb_asphalt '' .of kb_particular note , in the 21st century , is the use of re-refined kb_engine kb_palm_oil bottoms -- `` reob '' or `` reobs '' —the residue of kb_automotive_oil_recycling kb_engine kb_palm_oil , collected from the bottoms of re-refining kb_vacuum_distillation towers . kb_it contains the various non-refined kb_chemical_element and kb_chemical_compound in kb_recycling kb_engine kb_palm_oil , leftover from the re-refining process—both additives to the original kb_palm_oil , and materials accumulating from its circulation in the kb_engine ( typically kb_iron and kb_copperthe majority of kb_asphalt used commercially is obtained from kb_petroleum . nonetheless , kb_prespa_lake amounts of kb_asphalt occur in concentrated kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism in kb_nature . naturally occurring kb_deposit_(geology) of kb_asphalt are formed from the remains of kb_ancient_history , kb_microscopic_scale kb_algae ( diatoms ) and kb_other_(philosophy) once-living things . these remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the kb_oceanus or kb_lake where the organisms lived . under the kb_heat_(1972_film) ( above 50 °c ) and kb_pressure of burial deep in the kb_earth , the remains were transformed into materials such as kb_asphalt , kb_kerogen , or kb_petroleum .kb_natural_number kb_deposit_(geology) of kb_asphalt include kb_list_of_lakes_in_alberta such as the kb_pitch_lake in kb_trinidad and kb_invasion_of_tobago and kb_lake_bermudez in kb_venezuela . kb_natural_number kb_petroleum_seep occur in the kb_la_brea_tar_pits brea kb_tar pits and in the kb_dead_sea kb_sea_(astronomy) .kb_asphalt also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as `` kb_oil_sands '' in kb_alberta , kb_canada , and the similar `` kb_tar sands '' in kb_utah , kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) .the kb_canadians kb_provinces_of_the_netherlands of kb_alberta has most of the kb_world 's reserves , in kb_triliteral huge kb_deposit_(geology) covering , an kb_area larger than kb_kingdom_of_england or kb_new_york_state . these bituminous sands contain of commercially established kb_patos-marinza_oil_field , giving kb_canada the kb_ipad_(third_generation) kb_largest_organisms kb_patos-marinza_oil_field in the kb_world . although kb_history kb_it was used without refining to pave roads , nearly all of the output is now used as kb_raw_material kb_material for kb_oil_refinery in kb_canada and the united kb_sovereign_state .the kb_world 's kb_largest_organisms deposit of kb_natural_number kb_asphalt , known as the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands , is located in the kb_mcmurray_formation formation of kb_northern_hemisphere kb_alberta . this formation is from the early kb_cretaceous , and is composed of numerous kb_lens_(optics) of oil-bearing kb_sand with up to 20 % kb_palm_oil . isotopic studies show the kb_palm_oil kb_deposit_(geology) to kb_beryllium about 110 million years kb_old_testament . kb_2_(number) smaller but still very kb_prespa_lake kb_geological_formation occur in the kb_peace_river_oil_sands sands and the kb_cold_lake_oil_sands kb_lake kb_oil_sands , to the kb_western_culture and kb_albanian_ohrid_lake_coast of the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands , respectively . of the kb_alberta kb_deposit_(geology) , only parts of the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands are shallow enough to kb_beryllium suitable for kb_surface_mining . the kb_other_(philosophy) 80 % has to kb_beryllium produced by kb_palm_oil kb_water_well using kb_enhanced_oil_recovery kb_palm_oil recovery techniques like kb_steam-assisted_gravity_drainage kb_gravity_(2013_film) drainage .much smaller kb_heavy_crude_oil kb_palm_oil or kb_asphalt kb_deposit_(geology) also occur in the kb_uinta_basin basin in kb_utah , kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) . the kb_tar_sand_triangle kb_triangle_(musical_instrument) deposit , for example , is roughly 6 % kb_asphalt .kb_asphalt may occur in hydrothermal veins . an example of this is within the kb_uinta_basin basin of kb_utah , in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , where there is kb_a swarm of laterally and kb_vertical_direction extensive veins composed of kb_a kb_solid kb_hydrocarbon termed kb_gilsonite . these veins formed by the kb_polymerization and solidification of kb_hydrocarbons that were mobilized from the deeper kb_palm_oil shales of the kb_green_river_formation formation during burial and kb_diagenesis .kb_asphalt is similar to the kb_organic_chemistry kb_matter in carbonaceous meteorites . however , detailed studies have shown these materials to kb_beryllium distinct . the vast kb_alberta kb_asphalt resources are considered to have started out as living kb_material from kb_ocean plants and kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing , mainly kb_algae , that died millions of years ago when an kb_ancient_history kb_oceanus covered kb_alberta . they were covered by mud , buried deeply over kb_time_(magazine) , and gently cooked into kb_palm_oil by geothermal kb_heat_(1972_film) at kb_a kb_temperature of . due to kb_pressure from the rising of the kb_rocky_mountains mountains in southwestern kb_alberta , 80 to 55 million years ago , the kb_palm_oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres and trapped into underground kb_sand kb_deposit_(geology) kb_left_behind by kb_ancient_history kb_river beds and kb_oceanus beaches , thus forming the kb_oil_sands .the use of kb_natural_number kb_asphalt for kb_waterproofing , and as an kb_adhesive dates at least to the fifth kb_millennium bc , with kb_a kb_crop storage basket discovered in kb_mehrgarh , of the kb_indus_valley_civilization , lined with kb_it . by the 3rd kb_millennium bc refined kb_rock_of_gibraltar kb_asphalt was in use in the kb_region , and was used to waterproof the kb_great_bath,_mohenjo-daro kb_bath,_somerset in mohenjo-daro .in the kb_ancient_history kb_middle_east kb_east_africa , the sumerians used kb_natural_number kb_asphalt kb_deposit_(geology) for kb_mortar_(masonry) between bricks and stones , to kb_cement parts of carvings , such as eyes , into kb_place_of_articulation , for kb_spacecraft kb_caulking , and for kb_waterproofing . the kb_ancient_greek historian kb_herodotus said hot kb_asphalt was used as kb_mortar_(masonry) in the walls of kb_babylon .the kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_euphrates_tunnel beneath the kb_river kb_euphrates at kb_babylon in the kb_time_(magazine) of queen kb_semiramis ( ca . 800 bc ) was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with kb_asphalt as kb_a kb_waterproofing agent .kb_asphalt was used by kb_ancient_history kb_egyptians to kb_embalming mummies . the kb_persian_alphabet word for kb_asphalt is `` moom '' , which is related to the kb_australian_english word kb_mummy . the kb_egyptians ' kb_primary_education source of kb_asphalt was the kb_dead_sea kb_sea_(astronomy) , which kb_ancient_rome kb_roman_empire knew as `` palus asphaltites '' ( kb_asphalt kb_lake ) .in approximately 40 kb_anno_domini , kb_dioscorides described the kb_dead_sea kb_sea_(astronomy) kb_material as `` judaicum kb_asphalt '' , and noted kb_other_(philosophy) places in the kb_region where kb_it could kb_beryllium found .the kb_sidon kb_asphalt is thought to refer to kb_material found at kb_hasbeya in kb_lebanon . kb_pliny_the_elder also refers to kb_asphalt kb_being found in kb_epirus_(ancient_state) . kb_asphalt was kb_a valuable kb_geostrategy resource . kb_it was the kb_space_debris of the kb_first_trimester known kb_battle_abbey for kb_a kb_hydrocarbon deposit — between the kb_seleucids and the kb_nabateans in 312 bc .in the kb_ancient_history kb_chinese_alchemy kb_east_africa , kb_natural_number kb_asphalt was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher kb_egyptian_fraction , leaving kb_a kb_thermoplastic kb_material of higher kb_molecular_weight that when layered on kb_object_relations_theory became quite hard upon cooling . this was used to cover kb_object_relations_theory that needed kb_waterproofing , such as scabbards and kb_other_(philosophy) items . kb_statuettes of kb_household kb_deities were also kb_casting_(metalworking) with this kb_type_(biology) of kb_material in kb_japan , and probably also in kb_china .in kb_north_america , kb_archaeology recovery has indicated that kb_asphalt was sometimes used to adhere stone kb_projectile points to wooden shafts . in kb_canada , kb_australian_aborigine kb_people_(american_magazine) used kb_asphalt seeping out of the banks of the kb_athabasca_river and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_list_of_rivers_of_alberta to waterproof birch bark canoes , and also heated kb_it in smudge pots to ward off mosquitoes in the summer .in 1553 , kb_pierre_belon belon described in kb_histidine kb_cold_working `` kb_observations_(pierre_belon) '' that `` pissasphalto '' , kb_a kb_mixture of kb_pitch_(flight) and kb_asphalt , was used in the kb_republic_of_ragusa ragusa ( now kb_dubrovnik , kb_croatia ) for tarring of ships .an 1838 edition of `` kb_mechanics magazine '' cites an early use of kb_asphalt in kb_france . kb_a pamphlet dated 1621 , by `` kb_a certain monsieur d'eyrinys , kb_sovereign_state that kb_he_(letter) had discovered the kb_existence ( of asphaltum ) in kb_prespa_lake quantities in the vicinity of neufchatel '' , and that kb_he_(letter) kb_anatolian_hypothesis to use kb_it in kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of ways – `` principally in the kb_construction of air-proof kb_granary , and in protecting , by means of the arches , the water-courses in kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth '' , which at that kb_time_(magazine) made the kb_water unusable . `` kb_he_(letter) expatiates also on the excellence of this kb_material for forming level and durable terraces '' in palaces , `` the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) likely to cross the kb_brain of kb_a parisian of that generation '' .but the kb_matter was generally neglected in kb_france until the kb_french_revolution of 1830. in the 1830s there was kb_a surge of kb_interest , and kb_asphalt became widely used `` for pavements , flat roofs , and the lining of cisterns , and in kb_kingdom_of_england , some use of kb_it had been made of kb_it for similar purposes '' . its rise in kb_europe was `` kb_a sudden phenomenon '' , after kb_natural_number kb_deposit_(geology) were found `` in kb_france at osbann ( kb_bas-rhin ) , the parc ( kb_ain ) and the puy-de-la-poix ( kb_puy-de-dôme ) '' , although kb_it could also kb_beryllium made artificially . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century uses in kb_france was the laying of about 24,000 kb_square yards of seyssel kb_asphalt at the kb_place_de_la_concorde la concorde in 1835 .among the kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet uses of kb_asphalt in the kb_united_kingdom kb_kingdom_(biology) was for etching . william kb_salmon 's `` polygraphice '' ( 1673 ) provides kb_a recipe for kb_varnish used in etching , consisting of kb_triliteral ounces of virgin kb_beeswax , kb_2_(number) ounces of kb_mastic_(plant_resin) , and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) ounce of asphaltum . by the fifth edition in 1685 , kb_he_(letter) had included more asphaltum recipes from kb_other_(philosophy) sources .the kb_first_trimester kb_kingdom_of_great_britain kb_patent for the use of kb_asphalt was `` cassell 's kb_patent asphalte or kb_asphalt '' in 1834. then on 25 november 1837 , kb_captain_r._t._claridge tappin claridge kb_patented the use of seyssel kb_asphalt ( kb_patent # 7849 ) , for use in asphalte kb_road_surface , having seen kb_it employed in kb_france and kb_belgium when visiting with kb_frederick_walter_simms walter simms , kb_world_health_organization worked with him on the introduction of kb_asphalt to kb_great_britain . dr t. kb_lamb_and_mutton phipson writes that kb_histidine kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , kb_samuel ryland phipson , kb_a friend of claridge , was also `` instrumental in introducing the asphalte kb_road_surface ( in 1836 ) '' . indeed , kb_mastic_(plant_resin) pavements had been previously employed at kb_vauxhall by kb_a competitor of claridge , but without success .claridge obtained kb_a kb_patent in kb_scottish_episcopal_church on 27 kb_march 1838 , and obtained kb_a kb_patent in kb_ireland on 23 april 1838. in 1851 , extensions for the 1837 kb_patent and for both 1838 patents were sought by the trustees of kb_a company previously formed by claridge . `` claridge 's kb_patent asphalte company '' —formed in 1838 for the purpose of introducing to kb_great_britain `` asphalte in its kb_natural_number kb_state_of_matter from the mine at pyrimont seysell in kb_france '' , — '' laid kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester kb_asphalt pavements in whitehall '' . trials were made of the kb_road_surface in 1838 on the footway in whitehall , the stable at knightsbridge barracks , `` and subsequently on the kb_space at the bottom of the steps leading from kb_waterloo_(abba_song) kb_place_of_articulation to st. james park '' . `` the formation in 1838 of claridge 's kb_patent asphalte company ( with kb_a distinguished kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of kb_aristocracy_(class) patrons , and kb_marc_isambard_brunel and kb_isambard_kingdom_brunel brunel as , respectively , kb_a trustee and consulting kb_civil_engineering ) , gave an enormous impetus to the development of kb_a kb_kingdom_of_great_britain kb_asphalt kb_industry '' . `` by the end of 1838 , at least kb_2_(number) kb_other_(philosophy) kb_list_of_companies_of_albania , robinson 's and the bastenne company , were in production '' , with kb_asphalt kb_being laid as paving at kb_brighton , herne bay , kb_diocese_of_canterbury , kensington , the strand , and kb_a kb_prespa_lake floor kb_area in bunhill-row , while meantime claridge 's whitehall paving `` continue ( d ) in good kb_order_(biology) '' .in 1838 , there was kb_a flurry of entrepreneurial activity involving kb_asphalt , which had uses beyond paving . for example , kb_asphalt could also kb_beryllium used for flooring , damp proofing in kb_buildings , and for kb_waterproofing of various types of pools and baths , both of which were also proliferating in the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century . on the kb_university_of_london stockmarket , there were various claims as to the exclusivity of kb_asphalt quality from kb_france , kb_germany and kb_kingdom_of_england . and numerous patents were granted in kb_france , with similar kb_grammatical_number of kb_patent applications kb_being denied in kb_kingdom_of_england due to their similarity to each kb_other_(philosophy) . in kb_kingdom_of_england , `` claridge 's was the kb_type_(biology) most used in the 1840s and 50s '' .in 1914 , claridge 's company entered into kb_a joint venture to produce kb_macadam#tar-bound_macadam kb_macadam , with materials manufactured through kb_a subsidiary company called clarmac roads ltd. kb_2_(number) products resulted , namely `` clarmac '' , and `` clarphalte '' , with the former kb_being manufactured by clarmac roads and the latter by claridge 's kb_patent asphalte co. , although `` clarmac '' was more widely used . however , the kb_first_world_war kb_war ruined the clarmac company , which entered into liquidation in 1915. the failure of clarmac roads ltd had kb_a flow-on effect to claridge 's company , which was itself compulsorily wound up , ceasing operations in 1917 , having invested kb_a substantial amount of funds into the kb_new_world venture , both at the outset and in kb_a subsequent attempt to save the clarmac company .kb_asphalt was thought in kb_rilindja_kombëtare century kb_great_britain to contain kb_chemical_substance with medicinal kb_chemical_property . extracts from kb_asphalt were used to treat kb_catarrh and some kb_theory_of_forms of kb_asthma and as kb_a remedy against worms , especially the kb_tapeworm .the kb_first_trimester use of kb_asphalt in the kb_new_world was by kb_indigenous_peoples kb_people's_party_of_armenia . on the kb_western_culture kb_coast , as early as the 13th century , the kb_tongva_people , kb_luiseño_people and kb_chumash_people kb_people's_party_of_armenia collected the naturally occurring kb_asphalt that seeped to the kb_surface_(topology) above underlying kb_petroleum kb_deposit_(geology) . all kb_triliteral kb_group_(mathematics) used the kb_matter as an kb_adhesive . kb_it is found on many different kb_artifact_(archaeology) of tools and ceremonial items . for example , kb_it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or kb_turtle kb_electron_shells to kb_rattle_(percussion_instrument) handles . kb_it was also used in decorations . small round kb_electron_shell beads were often kb_set_(mythology) in asphaltum to provide decorations . kb_it was used as kb_a kb_sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying kb_water , possibly poisoning those kb_world_health_organization drank the kb_water . kb_asphalt was used also to kb_seal_(emblem) the planks on ocean-going canoes .kb_asphalt was kb_first_trimester used to pave streets in the 1870s . at kb_first_trimester naturally occurring `` bituminous kb_rock_of_gibraltar '' was used , such as at ritchie mines in macfarlan in ritchie county , kb_west_virginia from 1852 to 1873. in 1876 , asphalt-based paving was used to pave kb_pennsylvania avenue in kb_washington,_d.c. dc , in kb_time_(magazine) for the celebration of the national centennial . in the horse-drawn era , streets were unpaved and covered with dirt or kb_gravel . however , that produced uneven wear , opened kb_new_world hazards for pedestrians and made for dangerous potholes for bicycles and for motor vehicles . kb_manhattan alone had 130,000 horses in 1900 , pulling streetcars , wagons , and carriages , and leaving their waste behind . they were not fast , and pedestrians could dodge and scramble their way across the crowded streets . small towns continued to rely on dirt and kb_gravel , but larger cities wanted much better streets . they looked to kb_wood or granite kb_periodic_table_block by the kb_1850s_in_the_united_states . in 1890 , kb_a kb_ipad_(third_generation) of kb_chicago 's 2000 miles of streets were kb_road_surface , chiefly with wooden kb_periodic_table_block , which gave better traction than mud . kb_brick surfacing was kb_a good compromise , but even better was kb_asphalt paving , which was easy to install and to cut through to get at sewers . with kb_university_of_london and kb_paris serving as models , kb_washington,_d.c. laid 400,000 kb_square yards of kb_asphalt paving by 1882 ; kb_it became the kb_rutherford_model for buffalo , kb_philadelphia and elsewhere . by the end of the century , kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) cities boasted 30 million kb_square yards of kb_asphalt paving , kb_water_well ahead of kb_brick . the streets became faster and more dangerous kb_sulfate electric traffic lights were installed . electric trolleys ( at 12 miles per hour ) became the main kb_transportation service for middle kb_class_(biology) shoppers and kb_office workers until they bought kb_automobiles after kb_1945_(gingrich_novel) and commuted from more distant suburbs in privacy and comfort on kb_asphalt highways .kb_canada has the kb_world 's kb_largest_organisms deposit of kb_natural_number kb_asphalt in the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands , and kb_canadians kb_first_nations along the kb_athabasca_river had kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) used kb_it to waterproof their canoes . in 1719 , kb_a kb_cree_language kb_english_alphabet#letter_names wa-pa-su brought kb_a kb_sample_(statistics) for kb_trade to kb_henry_kelsey kelsey of the kb_hudson_river 's bay company , kb_world_health_organization was the kb_first_trimester recorded kb_european_eel to kb_episcopal_see kb_it . however , kb_it was n't until 1787 that fur trader and kb_age_of_discovery kb_alexander_mackenzie_(explorer) saw the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands and said , `` at about 24 miles from the fork ( of the kb_athabasca_river and clearwater kb_list_of_rivers_of_alberta ) are some bituminous fountains into which kb_a pole of 20 kb_foot kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) may kb_beryllium inserted without the least kb_electrical_resistance . ''the kb_lightness of the deposit was obvious from the start , but the means of extracting the kb_asphalt was not . the nearest town , kb_fort_mcmurray , kb_alberta , was kb_a small fur kb_trading_post post , kb_other_(philosophy) kb_market_(economics) were far away , and kb_transportation costs were too kb_high_middle_ages to kb_spacecraft the raw bituminous kb_sand for paving . in 1915 , sidney ells of the kb_united_states_courts_of_appeals mines branch experimented with separation techniques and used the kb_decay_product to pave 600 kb_foot of road in kb_edmonton , kb_alberta . kb_other_(philosophy) roads in kb_alberta were kb_road_surface with kb_material extracted from kb_oil_sands , but kb_it was generally not kb_economic_anthropology . during the 1920s kb_karl_clark_(chemist) karl a. kb_william_clark of the kb_alberta_research_council council kb_patented kb_a hot kb_water kb_palm_oil separation process and entrepreneur robert kb_circa fitzsimmons built the kb_bitumount kb_palm_oil separation kb_plant , which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to per day of kb_asphalt using dr. kb_william_clark 's method . most of the kb_asphalt was used for kb_waterproofing roofs , but kb_semi-syllabary included fuels , lubrication kb_cooking_oil , kb_computer_printer ink , medicines , rust- and acid-proof paints , fireproof roofing , street paving , kb_patent_leather , and fence post preservatives . eventually fitzsimmons kb_ran_(film) out of kb_money and the kb_plant was taken over by the kb_alberta kb_forms_of_government . today the kb_bitumount kb_plant is kb_a kb_provincial_historic_sites_of_alberta kb_historic_site site .kb_asphalt was used in early photographic kb_technology . in 1826 or 1827 , kb_it was used by kb_france kb_scientist kb_joseph_nicéphore_niépce nicéphore niépce to make the kb_view_from_the_window_at_le_gras surviving photograph from kb_nature . the kb_asphalt was thinly coated onto kb_a kb_pewter plate which was then exposed in kb_a kb_camera . exposure to kb_light hardened the kb_asphalt and made kb_it kb_insoluble , kb_sulfate that when kb_it was subsequently rinsed with kb_a kb_solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained . many hours of exposure in the kb_camera were required , making kb_asphalt impractical for kb_ordinary_(officer) photography , but from the kb_1850s_in_the_united_states to the 1920s kb_it was in common use as kb_a kb_photoresist in the production of printing kb_photographic_plate for various photomechanical printing processes .kb_asphalt was the kb_nemesis_(nobel_play) of many artists during the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century . although widely used for kb_a kb_time_(magazine) , kb_it ultimately proved unstable for use in kb_palm_oil kb_painting , especially when mixed with the most common diluents , such as linseed kb_palm_oil , kb_varnish and kb_turpentine . unless thoroughly diluted , kb_asphalt never fully solidifies and kb_will_and_testament in kb_time_(magazine) corrupt the kb_other_(philosophy) pigments with which kb_it comes into contact . the use of kb_asphalt as kb_a glaze to kb_set_(mythology) in shadow or mixed with kb_other_(philosophy) colors to render kb_a darker kb_tone_(linguistics) resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings , for instance those of kb_eugène_delacroix . perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of kb_asphalt is kb_théodore_géricault géricault 's kb_the_raft_of_the_medusa of the kb_medusa ( 1818–1819 ) , where kb_histidine use of kb_asphalt caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the kb_paint and kb_canvas to buckle .the vast majority of refined kb_asphalt is used in kb_construction : primarily as kb_a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications . according to the kb_requirement_analysis of the end use , kb_asphalt is produced to specification . this is achieved either by refining or blending . kb_it is estimated that the kb_electric_current kb_world use of kb_asphalt is approximately 102 million kb_tonnes per year . approximately 85 % of all the kb_asphalt produced is used as the kb_binder_(material) in kb_asphalt_concrete for roads . kb_it is also used in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_road_surface areas such as kb_airport runways , kb_car parks and footways . typically , the production of kb_asphalt_concrete involves mixing kb_fine_(penalty) and coarse kb_construction_aggregate such as kb_sand , kb_gravel and crushed kb_rock_of_gibraltar with kb_asphalt , which acts as the binding agent . kb_other_(philosophy) materials , such as kb_recycling polymers ( e.g. , kb_rubber kb_tire ) , may kb_beryllium added to the kb_asphalt to modify its kb_chemical_property according to the kb_application_(computing) for which the kb_asphalt is ultimately kb_intention .kb_a further 10 % of kb_globalization kb_asphalt production is used in roofing applications , where its kb_waterproofing qualities are invaluable .the remaining 5 % of kb_asphalt is used mainly for sealing and insulating purposes in kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of building materials , such as pipe coatings , carpet tile backing and kb_paint . kb_asphalt is kb_applied_science in the kb_construction and maintenance of many kb_structural_analysis , kb_systems_analysis , and components , such as the following :the kb_largest_organisms use of kb_asphalt is for making kb_asphalt_concrete for road surfaces ; this accounts for approximately 85 % of the kb_asphalt consumed in the united kb_sovereign_state . there are about 4,000 kb_asphalt_concrete mixing plants in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) , and kb_a similar kb_grammatical_number in kb_europe .kb_asphalt_concrete kb_road_surface mixes are typically composed of 5 % kb_asphalt kb_cement and 95 % kb_construction_aggregate ( stone , kb_sand , and kb_gravel ) . due to its highly kb_viscosity kb_nature , kb_asphalt kb_cement must kb_beryllium heated kb_sulfate kb_it can kb_beryllium mixed with the kb_construction_aggregate at the kb_asphalt mixing facility . the kb_temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the kb_asphalt and the kb_construction_aggregate , but kb_asphalt_concrete#mixture_formulations kb_asphalt technologies allow producers to reduce the kb_temperature required .the weight of an kb_asphalt kb_road_surface depends upon the kb_construction_aggregate kb_type_(biology) , the kb_asphalt , and the kb_air_(classical_element) void content . an average example in the united kb_sovereign_state is about 112 pounds per kb_square_yard , per kb_inch of kb_road_surface thickness .when maintenance is performed on kb_asphalt pavements , such as kb_pavement_milling to remove kb_a worn or damaged kb_surface_(topology) , the removed kb_material can kb_beryllium returned to kb_a facility for kb_fish_processing into kb_new_world kb_road_surface mixtures . the kb_asphalt in the removed kb_material can kb_beryllium reactivated and put back to use in kb_new_world kb_road_surface mixes . with some 95 % of kb_road_surface roads kb_being constructed of or surfaced with kb_asphalt , kb_a substantial amount of kb_asphalt kb_road_surface kb_material is reclaimed each year . according to kb_industry surveys conducted annually by the kb_federal_highway_administration kb_administration_(government) and the national kb_asphalt kb_road_surface kb_continental_association , more than 99 % of the kb_asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of kb_new_world pavements , roadbeds , shoulders and embankments .kb_asphalt_concrete paving is widely used in airports around the kb_world . due to the sturdiness and ability to kb_beryllium repaired quickly , kb_it is widely used for runways .kb_mastic_asphalt is kb_a kb_type_(biology) of kb_asphalt that differs from dense graded kb_asphalt ( kb_asphalt_concrete ) in that kb_it has kb_a higher kb_asphalt ( kb_binder_(material) ) content , usually around 7–10 % of the whole kb_construction_aggregate mix , as opposed to rolled kb_asphalt_concrete , which has only around 5 % kb_asphalt . this kb_thermoplastic kb_matter is widely used in the building kb_industry for kb_waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground . kb_mastic_asphalt is heated to kb_a kb_temperature of and is kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) in layers to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism an impervious kb_potential_barrier about thick .kb_a kb_grammatical_number of technologies allow kb_asphalt to kb_beryllium mixed at much lower temperatures . these involve mixing with kb_petroleum solvents to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism `` cutbacks '' with kb_redox kb_melting_point or mixing with kb_water to kb_turn_(geometry) the kb_asphalt into an kb_emulsion . kb_asphalt emulsions contain up to 70 % kb_asphalt and typically less than 1.5 % kb_protein_sequencing additives . there are kb_2_(number) main types of emulsions with different affinity for kb_construction_aggregate , kb_cationic and kb_anionic . kb_asphalt emulsions are used in kb_a wide kb_variety_(magazine) of applications . kb_chipseal involves spraying the road kb_surface_(topology) with kb_asphalt kb_emulsion followed by kb_a layer of crushed kb_rock_of_gibraltar , kb_gravel or crushed kb_slag . kb_slurry kb_seal_(emblem) involves the creation of kb_a kb_mixture of kb_asphalt kb_emulsion and kb_fine_(penalty) crushed kb_construction_aggregate that is kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) on the kb_surface_(topology) of kb_a road . cold-mixed kb_asphalt can also kb_beryllium made from kb_asphalt kb_emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed kb_asphalt , several inches in depth , and kb_asphalt emulsions are also blended into kb_recycling hot-mix kb_asphalt to create low-cost pavements .kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , also known as syncrude , is the output from kb_a kb_upgrader facility used in connection with kb_palm_oil kb_sand production in kb_canada . bituminous sands are mined using enormous ( 100 ton capacity ) kb_power_(physics) shovels and loaded into even larger ( 400 ton capacity ) kb_dump_trucks trucks for kb_movement_(sign_language) to an upgrading facility . the process used to extract the kb_asphalt from the kb_sand is kb_a hot kb_water process originally kb_adaptation by kb_karl_clark_(chemist) karl kb_william_clark of the kb_university_of_alberta kb_alberta during the 1920s . after extraction from the kb_sand , the kb_asphalt is fed into kb_a kb_upgrader which converts kb_it into kb_a kb_light_crude_oil kb_palm_oil kb_cognate . this synthetic kb_matter is kb_fluid enough to kb_beryllium transferred through kb_petroleum kb_palm_oil pipelines and can kb_beryllium fed into kb_petroleum kb_oil_refinery without any further treatment . by 2015 kb_canadians kb_asphalt upgraders were producing over per day of kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , of which 75 % was exported to kb_oil_refinery in the united kb_sovereign_state .in kb_alberta , five kb_asphalt upgraders produce kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil and kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of kb_other_(philosophy) products : the kb_suncor_energy kb_energy_industry upgrader near kb_fort_mcmurray , kb_alberta produces kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil plus kb_diesel_engine kb_fuel ; the kb_syncrude_canada kb_canada , kb_canadian_natural_resources resources , and kb_nexen upgraders near kb_fort_mcmurray produce kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil ; and the kb_electron_shell kb_scotford_upgrader upgrader near kb_edmonton produces kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil plus an intermediate kb_feedstock for the nearby kb_electron_shell kb_oil_refinery . kb_a sixth upgrader , under kb_construction in 2015 near redwater , kb_alberta , kb_will_and_testament upgrade half of its crude kb_asphalt directly to kb_diesel_engine kb_fuel , with the remainder of the output kb_being sold as kb_feedstock to nearby kb_oil_refinery and kb_petrochemical plants .kb_canadians kb_asphalt does not differ substantially from kb_cooking_oil such as kb_venezuelans extra-heavy and kb_mexican_people kb_heavy_crude_oil kb_palm_oil in kb_protein_sequencing kb_function_composition , and the real difficulty is moving the extremely kb_viscosity kb_asphalt through kb_palm_oil pipelines to the refinery . many kb_modern_history kb_oil_refinery are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded kb_asphalt directly into products such as kb_gasoline , kb_diesel_engine kb_fuel , and refined kb_asphalt without any preprocessing . this is particularly common in areas such as the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) kb_gulf_of_mexico kb_coast , where kb_refineries were kb_aircraft_design_process to process kb_venezuelans and kb_mexican_people kb_palm_oil , and in areas such as the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) kb_midwestern_united_states where kb_refineries were rebuilt to process kb_heavy_crude_oil kb_palm_oil as domestic kb_light kb_extraction_of_petroleum declined . given the kb_utility , such kb_heavy_crude_oil kb_oil_refinery usually prefer to buy kb_asphalt rather than synthetic kb_palm_oil because the cost is lower , and in some kb_noun_case because they prefer to produce more kb_diesel_engine kb_fuel and less kb_gasoline . by 2015 kb_canadians production and exports of non-upgraded kb_asphalt exceeded that of kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil at over per day , of which about 65 % was exported to the united kb_sovereign_state .because of the difficulty of moving crude kb_asphalt through pipelines , non-upgraded kb_asphalt is usually diluted with kb_natural-gas_condensate condensate in kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism called kb_dilbit or with kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , called kb_synbit . however , to meet international competition , much non-upgraded kb_asphalt is now sold as kb_a blend of kb_cross-platform_software kb_grade_(education) of kb_asphalt , kb_petroleum kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , kb_synthetic_crude kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil , and condensate in kb_a standardized benchmark kb_decay_product such as kb_western_canadian_select select . this sour , heavy kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil blend is kb_aircraft_design_process to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy kb_cooking_oil such as kb_petroleum_industry_in_mexico or kb_arabian_plate kb_dubai_crude crude .kb_asphalt was used starting in the kb_1960s_in_the_united_states as kb_a kb_hydrophobe kb_matrix_(math) aiming to encapsulate kb_radioactive_decay waste such as medium-activity kb_salt_(chemistry) ( mainly kb_solubility kb_sodium_nitrate and kb_sodium_sulfate ) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or kb_radioactive_decay sludges from kb_sediment_transport#fluvial ponds . bituminised kb_radioactive_decay waste containing highly kb_radiotoxic kb_ionizing_radiation#alpha_particles kb_transuranium_element from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in kb_france , kb_belgium and kb_japan , but this kb_type_(biology) of waste kb_physical_exercise has been abandoned because operational kb_air_safety issues ( risks of kb_fire_(classical_element) , as occurred in kb_a bituminisation kb_plant at tokai works in kb_japan ) and long-term stability kb_problems_(aristotle) related to their kb_deep_geological_repository in deep kb_rock_of_gibraltar kb_geological_formation . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the main problem is the swelling of kb_asphalt exposed to kb_radiation and to kb_water . kb_asphalt swelling is kb_first_trimester induced by kb_radiation because of the presence of kb_hydrogen kb_gas bubbles generated by kb_alpha_(letter) and gamma kb_radiolysis . kb_a kb_second kb_mechanism_(biology) is kb_the_matrix kb_matrix_(math) swelling when the encapsulated kb_hygroscopic kb_salt_(chemistry) exposed to kb_water or moisture start to rehydrate and to kb_dissolve_(filmmaking) . the kb_high_middle_ages kb_concentration of kb_salt_(chemistry) in the pore kb_solid_solution inside the bituminised kb_matrix_(math) is then responsible for kb_osmosis effects inside the bituminised kb_matrix_(math) . the kb_water moves in the direction of the concentrated kb_salt_(chemistry) , the kb_asphalt acting as kb_a kb_semipermeable_membrane kb_cell_membrane . this also kb_causes_of_autism kb_the_matrix kb_matrix_(math) to swell . the swelling kb_pressure due to kb_osmosis effect under constant kb_volume can kb_beryllium as kb_high_middle_ages as 200 bar . if not properly managed , this kb_high_middle_ages kb_pressure can cause fractures in the near field of kb_a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste . when the bituminised kb_matrix_(math) has been altered by swelling , encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of kb_ground_water kb_water and released in the geosphere . the kb_high_middle_ages kb_ionic_strength of the concentrated kb_saline_(medicine) kb_solid_solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in kb_clay host kb_rock_(geology) . the presence of chemically kb_reactivity_(chemistry) kb_nitrate can also kb_affect_(psychology) the kb_redox conditions prevailing in the host kb_rock_of_gibraltar by establishing kb_redox conditions , preventing the kb_redox of redox-sensitive radionuclides . under their higher valences , radionuclides of kb_chemical_element such as kb_selenium , technetium , kb_uranium , kb_neptunium and kb_plutonium have kb_a higher kb_solubility and are also often present in kb_water as non-retarded anions . this makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging .different kb_type_(biology) of kb_asphalt have been used : blown kb_asphalt ( partly kb_oxidation with kb_air_(classical_element) kb_oxygen at kb_high_middle_ages kb_temperature after kb_distillation , and harder ) and direct kb_distillation kb_asphalt ( softer ) . blown bitumens like mexphalte , with kb_a kb_high_middle_ages content of kb_saturation_(chemistry) kb_hydrocarbons , are more easily biodegraded by microorganisms than direct kb_distillation kb_asphalt , with kb_a low content of kb_saturation_(chemistry) kb_hydrocarbons and kb_a kb_high_middle_ages content of kb_aromatic kb_hydrocarbons .kb_concrete encapsulation of radwaste is presently considered kb_a safer alternative by the kb_nuclear_industry kb_industry and the kb_waste_management kb_management organisations .roofing shingles account for most of the remaining kb_asphalt consumption . kb_semi-syllabary include kb_cattle sprays , fence-post treatments , and kb_waterproofing for fabrics . kb_asphalt is used to make kb_japan_black , kb_a kb_lacquerabout 40,000,000 tons were produced in 1984. kb_it is obtained as the `` heavy '' ( i.e. , difficult to distill ) kb_fraction_(mathematics) . kb_material with kb_a kb_boiling_point point greater than around 500 °c is considered kb_asphalt . kb_vacuum_distillation separates kb_it from the kb_other_(philosophy) components in kb_crude_oil kb_palm_oil ( such as kb_naphtha , kb_gasoline and kb_diesel_engine ) . the resulting kb_material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the kb_chemical_property of the kb_material to suit applications . in kb_a kb_de-asphalting_unit kb_units_of_measurement , the crude kb_asphalt is treated with either kb_propane or kb_butane in kb_a kb_supercritical_fluid kb_phase_(matter) to extract the lighter molecules , which are then separated . further kb_fish_processing is possible by `` blowing '' the kb_decay_product : namely reacting kb_it with kb_oxygen . this step makes the kb_decay_product harder and more kb_viscosity .kb_asphalt is typically stored and transported at temperatures around . sometimes kb_diesel_oil or kb_kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity ; upon kb_childbirth , these lighter materials are separated out of the kb_mixture . this kb_mixture is often called `` kb_asphalt kb_feedstock '' , or bfs . some kb_dump_trucks trucks route the hot kb_engine exhaust through pipes in the dump kb_human_body to keep the kb_material warm . the backs of tippers carrying kb_asphalt , as kb_water_well as some kb_car_handling equipment , are also commonly sprayed with kb_a releasing agent before filling to kb_aid release . kb_diesel_oil is no longer used as kb_a kb_release_agent agent due to environmental concerns .naturally occurring crude kb_asphalt impregnated in kb_sedimentary_rock is the kb_prime_(symbol) kb_animal_feed stock for kb_petroleum production from `` kb_oil_sands '' , currently under development in kb_alberta , kb_canada . kb_canada has most of the kb_world 's supply of kb_natural_number kb_asphalt , covering 140,000 kb_square kilometres ( an kb_area larger than kb_kingdom_of_england ) , giving kb_it the second-largest proven kb_patos-marinza_oil_field in the kb_world . the kb_athabasca_oil_sands sands are the kb_largest_organisms kb_asphalt deposit in kb_canada and the only kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) accessible to kb_surface_mining , although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper kb_deposit_(geology) becoming producible by `` kb_in_situ situ '' methods . because of kb_world_oil_market_chronology_from_2003 increases after 2003 , producing kb_asphalt became highly profitable , but as kb_a result of the decline after 2014 kb_it became uneconomic to build kb_new_world plants again . by 2014 , kb_canadians crude kb_asphalt production averaged about per day and was projected to rise to per day by 2020. the total amount of crude kb_asphalt in kb_alberta that could kb_beryllium extracted is estimated to kb_beryllium about , which at kb_a rate of would last about 200 years .although uncompetitive economically , kb_asphalt can kb_beryllium made from nonpetroleum-based renewable resources such as kb_sugar , kb_molasses and kb_rice , kb_corn and kb_potato starches . kb_asphalt can also kb_beryllium made from waste kb_material by kb_fractional_distillation kb_distillation of used kb_motor_oil kb_palm_oil , which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills . use of kb_motor_oil kb_palm_oil may cause premature kb_cracking_(chemistry) in colder climates , resulting in roads that need to kb_beryllium repaved more

occurring kb_solid kb_hydrocarbon kb_asphalt found in native kb_deposit_(geology) in kb_selenice , in kb_albania , the only kb_european_eel kb_asphalt mine still in use . the kb_asphalt is found in the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of veins , filling cracks in kb_a more or less horizontal direction . the kb_asphalt content varies from kb_bismuth % to 92 % ( kb_solubility in kb_carbon disulphide ) , with kb_a penetration kb_lightness near to kb_0_(number) and kb_a softening point ( kb_ring_(mathematics) and ball ) around 120 °c . the kb_insoluble kb_matter , consisting mainly of kb_silica kb_ore , ranges from kb_group_8_element % to 17 % .kb_albanians kb_asphalt extraction has kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_history and was practiced in an organized way by kb_ancient_rome kb_roman_empire . after kb_century_(cricket) of silence , the kb_first_trimester mentions of kb_albanians kb_asphalt appeared only in 1868 , when the frenchman kb_henri_coquand published the kb_first_trimester kb_geological description of the kb_deposit_(geology) of kb_albanians kb_asphalt . in 1875 , the kb_exploitation_film kb_catalan_constitutions were granted to the kb_ottoman_empire kb_forms_of_government and in 1912 , they were transferred to the kb_italian_language company simsa . since kb_1945_(gingrich_novel) , the mine was exploited by the kb_albanians kb_forms_of_government and from 2001 to date , the kb_management passed to kb_a kb_france company , which organized the kb_mining_industry process for the manufacture of the kb_natural_number kb_asphalt on an industrial scale .today the mine is predominantly exploited in an kb_open_standard pit quarry but several of the many underground mines ( deep and extending over several km ) still remain viable . selenizza is produced primarily in granular kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , after kb_melting_point the kb_asphalt pieces selected in the mine .selenizza is mainly used as an additive in the kb_road_surface kb_construction sector . kb_it is mixed with traditional kb_asphalt to improve both the viscoelastic kb_chemical_property and the kb_electrical_resistance to ageing . kb_it may kb_beryllium blended with the hot kb_asphalt in kb_german_tanks_in_world_war_ii , but its granular kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism allows kb_it to kb_beryllium fed in the mixer or in the kb_recycling kb_ring_(mathematics) of normal kb_asphalt plants . kb_other_(philosophy) typical applications include the production of kb_mastic_(plant_resin) asphalts for sidewalks , kb_romanesque_architecture , car-parks and kb_urban_area roads as kb_water_well as drilling kb_fluid additives for the kb_crude_oil kb_gas kb_industry . selenizza is kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance in

kb_science of the kb_natural_number selenizza compared with kb_petroleum kb_asphalt has shown that the environmental impact of the selenizza is about half the impact of the road kb_asphalt produced in kb_oil_refinery in terms of kb_carbon_dioxide kb_emission_spectra .although kb_asphalt typically makes up only 4 to 5 percent ( by weight ) of the kb_road_surface kb_mixture , as the kb_road_surface 's kb_binder_(material) , kb_it is also the most expensive part of the cost of the road-paving kb_material .during kb_asphalt 's early use in kb_modern_history paving , kb_palm_oil refiners gave kb_it away . however , kb_asphalt is , today , kb_a highly traded commodity . its prices increased substantially in the early 21st century . kb_a kb_federal_government_of_the_united_states report kb_sovereign_state :the report indicates that an `` average '' 1-mile ( 1.6-kilometer ) -long , four-lane highway would include `` 300 tons of kb_asphalt , '' which , `` in kb_2002_australian_open

kb_teleprinter kb_code promoted by kb_bell kb_big_data kb_service_(economics) . kb_cold_working on the kb_ascii standard began on kb_october 6 , kb_u.s._presidential_election,_1960 , with the kb_first_trimester meeting of the kb_american_standards_association kb_continental_association 's ( asa ) ( now the kb_american_national_standards_institute kb_corporate_social_responsibility institute or kb_american_national_standards_institute ) x3.2 subcommittee . the kb_first_trimester edition of the standard was published in 1963 , underwent kb_a kb_major_(united_states) revision during 1967 , and experienced its most recent update during 1986. compared to kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet kb_telegraph kb_code_(cryptography) , the kb_anatolian_hypothesis kb_bell kb_code and kb_ascii were both kb_totally_ordered_set for more convenient kb_sorting_algorithm ( i.e. , alphabetization ) of lists , and added features for devices kb_other_(philosophy) than teleprinters .originally based on the kb_english_alphabet , kb_ascii encodes 128 specified kb_character_(computing) into seven-bit integers as shown by the kb_ascii chart above . ninety-five of the encoded kb_character_(computing) are printable : these include the digits `` 0 '' to `` 9 '' , kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_a '' to `` kb_carboxybenzyl '' , kb_upper_case kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_a '' to `` kb_carboxybenzyl '' , and punctuation kb_symbols . in kb_addition , the original kb_ascii specification included 33 non-printing control kb_code_(cryptography) which originated with

subcommittee 's x3.2.4 kb_working_group kb_group_(periodic_table) ( now kb_incits ) . the asa became the kb_united_states_of_america_standards_institute of kb_americas kb_corporate_social_responsibility institute ( usasi ) and ultimately the kb_american_national_standards_institute kb_corporate_social_responsibility institute ( kb_american_national_standards_institute ) .with the kb_other_(philosophy) special kb_character_(computing) and control kb_code_(cryptography) filled in , kb_ascii was published as asa x3.4-1963 , leaving 28 kb_code positions without any assigned kb_meaning_(linguistics) , reserved for future standardization , and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) unassigned kb_control_code kb_code . there was some kb_abortion_debate at the kb_time_(magazine) whether there should kb_beryllium more control kb_character_(computing) rather than the kb_lower_case kb_alphabet . the indecision did not last kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) : during may 1963 the ccitt working party on the kb_new_world kb_telegraph kb_alphabet kb_anatolian_hypothesis to assign kb_lower_case kb_character_(computing) to `` sticks '' 6 and 7 , and kb_international_organization_for_standardization organization for standardization tc 97 sc kb_alkaline_earth_metal voted during kb_october to incorporate the change into

and 7 caused the kb_character_(computing) to differ in kb_bit_(horse) kb_pattern from the kb_upper_egypt case by kb_a kb_single_bond kb_bit_(horse) , which simplified kb_case-insensitive kb_character_(computing) matching and the kb_construction of keyboards and kb_computer_printer .the x3 committee made kb_other_(philosophy) changes , including kb_other_(philosophy) kb_new_world kb_character_(computing) ( the kb_brace_(punctuation) and kb_vertical_bar bar kb_character_(computing) ) , renaming some control kb_character_(computing) ( som became start of header ( soh ) ) and

kb_american_national_standards_institute x3.4-1986 .revisions of the kb_ascii standard :in the x3.15 standard , the x3 committee also addressed how kb_ascii should kb_beryllium transmitted (

kb_teleprinter encoding kb_systems_analysis . like kb_other_(philosophy) kb_character_(computing) encodings , kb_ascii specifies kb_a correspondence between kb_digital_data kb_bit_(horse) patterns and kb_character_(computing) kb_symbols ( i.e . kb_graphemes and control kb_character_(computing) ) . this allows kb_digital_data devices to communicate with each kb_other_(philosophy) and to process , store , and communicate character-oriented kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) such as written kb_language . before kb_ascii was kb_adaptation , the encodings in use included 26 kb_english_alphabet kb_character_(computing) , 10 numerical digits , and from 11 to 25 special graphic kb_symbols . to include all these , and control kb_character_(computing) compatible with the kb_ccitt consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique ( ccitt ) international kb_telegraph kb_alphabet no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal ( kb_ita2 ) standard of 1924 , kb_fieldata ( 1956 ) , and

1870 and kb_patented in 1874 .the committee debated the possibility of kb_a kb_shift_code kb_function_(biology) ( like in kb_ita2 ) , which would allow more than 64 kb_code_(cryptography) to kb_beryllium represented by kb_a kb_six-bit_character_code kb_code . in kb_a shifted kb_code , some kb_character_(computing) kb_code_(cryptography) determine choices between options for the following kb_character_(computing) kb_code_(cryptography) . kb_it allows compact encoding , but is less reliable for kb_data_transmission , as an kb_error in transmitting the kb_shift_code kb_code typically makes kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) part of the kb_transmission_coefficient unreadable . the kb_corporate_social_responsibility committee decided against shifting , and kb_sulfate kb_ascii required at least kb_a seven-bit kb_code .the committee considered an kb_eight-bit kb_code , since eight bits ( octets ) would allow kb_2_(number) four-bit patterns to efficiently encode kb_2_(number) digits with kb_binary-coded_decimal kb_decimal . however , kb_it would require all kb_data_transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice . the committee voted to use kb_a seven-bit kb_code to minimize costs associated with kb_data_transmission . since perforated tape at the kb_time_(magazine) could record eight bits in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_positional_notation , kb_it also allowed for kb_a kb_parity_bit kb_bit_(horse) for kb_error_checking if desired . kb_eight-bit machines ( with octets as the native kb_big_data kb_type_(biology) ) that did not use parity checking typically kb_set_(mythology) the eighth kb_bit_(horse) to 0. in some kb_computer_printer , the kb_high_middle_ages kb_bit_(horse) was used to enable kb_italics printing .the kb_code itself was patterned kb_sulfate that most control kb_code_(cryptography) were together and all graphic kb_code_(cryptography) were together , for ease of identification . the kb_first_trimester kb_2_(number) kb_sulfate called `` kb_ascii sticks '' ( 32 positions ) were reserved for control kb_character_(computing) . the `` kb_space '' kb_character_(computing) had to come before graphics to make kb_sorting_algorithm easier , kb_sulfate kb_it became kb_positional_notation 20 ; for the same kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving , many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits . the committee decided kb_it was important to support kb_upper_case kb_sixbit_code_pages alphabets , and chose to kb_pattern kb_ascii kb_sulfate kb_it could kb_beryllium kb_redox easily to kb_a usable 64-character kb_set_(mythology) of graphic kb_code_(cryptography) , as was done in the kb_dec_sixbit kb_code ( 1963 ) . kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) were therefore not interleaved with kb_upper_case . to keep options kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance for kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) and kb_other_(philosophy) graphics , the special and numeric kb_code_(cryptography) were arranged before the kb_letter_(alphabet) , and the kb_letter_(alphabet) `` kb_a '' was placed in kb_positional_notation 41 to match the draft of the corresponding kb_kingdom_of_great_britain standard . the digits 0–9 are prefixed with 011 , but the remaining kb_nibble bits correspond to their respective values in kb_binary_number , making kb_conversion_to_christianity with kb_binary-coded_decimal kb_decimal straightforward .many of the non-alphanumeric kb_character_(computing) were positioned to correspond to their shifted kb_positional_notation on typewriters ; an important subtlety is that these were based on `` kb_mechanics '' typewriters , not `` electric '' typewriters . kb_mechanics typewriters followed the standard kb_set_(mythology) by the remington no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal ( 1878 ) , the kb_first_trimester kb_typewriter with kb_a kb_shift_code kb_key_(cryptography) , and the shifted values of codice_1 were codice_2 early typewriters omitted `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' , using `` kb_oxygen '' ( kb_capital_letter `` kb_oxygen '' ) and `` l '' ( kb_lower_case kb_letter_(alphabet) `` l '' ) instead , but codice_3 and codice_4 pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common . thus , in kb_ascii codice_5 were placed in the kb_second stick , positions 1–5 , corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent stick . the parentheses could not correspond to `` 9 '' and `` 0 '' , however , because the kb_place_of_articulation corresponding to `` 0 '' was taken by the kb_space kb_character_(computing) . this was accommodated by removing codice_6 ( kb_underscore ) from `` 6 '' and shifting the remaining kb_character_(computing) , which corresponded to many kb_european_eel typewriters that placed the parentheses with `` kb_group_8_element '' and `` 9 '' . this discrepancy from typewriters kb_light-emitting_diode to bit-paired keyboards , notably the kb_teletype_model_33 kb_rutherford_model 33 , which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to kb_ascii , not to traditional kb_mechanics typewriters . electric typewriters , notably the kb_ibm_selectric ( 1961 ) , used kb_a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers following the kb_ibm_pc ( 1981 ) , especially kb_model_m ( kb_1984_world_rally_championship_season ) and thus kb_shift_code values for kb_symbols on kb_modern_history keyboards do not correspond as closely to the kb_ascii table as kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet keyboards did . the codice_7 pair also dates to the no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal , and the codice_8 pairs were used on some keyboards ( others , including the no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal , did not kb_shift_code codice_9 ( comma ) or codice_10 ( kb_full_stop stop ) kb_sulfate they could kb_beryllium used in kb_upper_case without unshifting ) . however , kb_ascii split the codice_11 pair ( dating to no . kb_alkaline_earth_metal ) , and rearranged mathematical kb_symbols ( varied conventions , commonly codice_12 ) to codice_13 .some common kb_character_(computing) were not included , notably codice_14 , while codice_15 were included as kb_diacritics for international use , and codice_16 for mathematical use , together with the kb_simple_polygon kb_line_(geometry) kb_character_(computing) codice_17 ( in kb_addition to common codice_18 ) . the `` @ '' kb_symbol was not used in kb_continental_europe and the committee expected kb_it would kb_beryllium replaced by an accented `` à '' in the kb_france variation , kb_sulfate the `` @ '' was placed in kb_positional_notation 40 , kb_right-wing_politics before the kb_letter_(alphabet) kb_a .the control kb_code_(cryptography) felt kb_essential_element for kb_data_transmission were the start of message ( som ) , end of address ( eoa ) , kb_end_of_message of message ( eom ) , end of kb_transmission_coefficient ( eot ) , `` kb_world_health_organization are you ? '' ( wru ) , `` are you ? '' ( ru ) , kb_a reserved kb_analyzer control ( dc0 ) , synchronous idle ( sync ) , and acknowledge ( ack ) . these were positioned to maximize the kb_hamming_distance kb_distance between their kb_bit_(horse) patterns .ascii-code kb_order_(biology) is also called `` asciibetical '' kb_order_(biology) . kb_collation of kb_big_data is sometimes done in this kb_order_(biology) rather than `` standard '' kb_alphabetical_order kb_order_(biology) ( kb_collating_sequence sequence ) . the main deviations in kb_ascii kb_order_(biology) are :an intermediate kb_order_(biology) converts kb_upper_case kb_letter_(alphabet) to kb_lower_case before comparing kb_ascii values .kb_ascii reserves the kb_first_trimester 32 kb_code_(cryptography) ( kb_grammatical_number 0–31 kb_decimal ) for control kb_character_(computing) : kb_code_(cryptography) originally kb_intention not to represent printable kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) , but rather to control devices ( such as kb_computer_printer ) that make use of kb_ascii , or to provide kb_metadata about kb_big_data streams such as those stored on kb_magnetic tape .for example , kb_character_(computing) 10 represents the `` kb_line_feed '' kb_function_(biology) ( which kb_causes_of_autism kb_a printer to advance its paper ) , and kb_character_(computing) kb_group_8_element represents `` backspace '' . refers to control kb_character_(computing) that do not include kb_carriage_return return , kb_line_feed or kb_whitespace_(computer_science) as non-whitespace control kb_character_(computing) . except for the control kb_character_(computing) that kb_linguistic_prescription kb_elementary_school line-oriented formatting , kb_ascii does not define any kb_mechanism_(biology) for describing the kb_structure or kb_appearance_(philosophy) of text within kb_a document . kb_other_(philosophy) schemes , such as markup languages , address page and document layout and formatting .the original kb_ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) . the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional , for example where kb_a kb_character_(computing) would kb_beryllium used slightly differently on kb_a kb_computer_terminal link than on kb_a kb_data_stream , and sometimes accidental , for example with the kb_meaning_(linguistics) of `` kb_delete_key '' .probably the most influential kb_single_bond kb_analyzer on the kb_interpretation_(logic) of these kb_character_(computing) was the kb_teletype_model_33 kb_rutherford_model 33 asr , which was kb_a printing kb_computer_terminal with an kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance kb_punched_tape tape reader/punch option . kb_punched_tape tape was kb_a very popular kb_list_of_art_mediums for long-term kb_program_(computing) storage until the 1980s , less costly and in some ways less fragile than kb_magnetic tape . in kb_particular , the kb_teletype_model_33 kb_rutherford_model 33 kb_machine assignments for kb_code_(cryptography) 17 ( control-q , dc1 , also known as xon ) , 19 ( control-s , dc3 , also known as xoff ) , and 127 ( kb_delete_key ) became kb_de_facto kb_corporate_social_responsibility . the kb_rutherford_model 33 was also notable for taking the description of control-g ( kb_code 7 , bel , kb_meaning_(linguistics) audibly alert the operator ) literally , as the kb_units_of_measurement contained an actual kb_bell which kb_it rang when kb_it received kb_a bel kb_character_(computing) . because the keytop for the kb_oxygen kb_key_(cryptography) also showed kb_a left-arrow kb_symbol ( from ascii-1963 , which had this kb_character_(computing) instead of kb_underscore ) , kb_a noncompliant use of kb_code 15 ( control-o , kb_shift_code in ) interpreted as `` kb_delete_key previous kb_character_(computing) '' was also kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by many early timesharing kb_systems_analysis but eventually became neglected .when kb_a teletype 33 asr equipped with the automatic kb_punched_tape tape kb_reader_(academic_rank) received kb_a control-s ( xoff , an abbreviation for transmit off ) , kb_it caused the tape kb_reader_(academic_rank) to stop ; receiving control-q ( xon , `` transmit on '' ) caused the tape kb_reader_(academic_rank) to resume . this technique became kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by several early kb_apollo_guidance_computer operating kb_systems_analysis as kb_a `` handshaking '' signal warning kb_a sender to stop kb_transmission_coefficient because of impending kb_arithmetic_overflow ; kb_it persists to this day in many kb_systems_analysis as kb_a kb_manual_(music) output control technique . on some kb_systems_analysis control-s retains its kb_meaning_(linguistics) but control-q is replaced by kb_a kb_second control-s to resume output . the 33 asr also could kb_beryllium configured to employ control-r ( dc2 ) and control-t ( dc4 ) to start and stop the tape kb_punch_(magazine) ; on some units equipped with this kb_function_(biology) , the corresponding kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) lettering on the keycap above the kb_letter_(alphabet) was tape and tape respectively .the teletype could not move the kb_human_head backwards , kb_sulfate kb_it did not put kb_a kb_key_(cryptography) on the keyboard to send kb_a bs ( backspace ) . instead there was kb_a kb_key_(cryptography) marked `` rubout '' that sent kb_code 127 ( del ) . the purpose of this kb_key_(cryptography) was to erase mistakes in kb_a hand-typed kb_punched_tape tape : the operator had to push kb_a kb_button_(control) on the tape kb_punch_(magazine) to back kb_it up , then kb_type_(biology) the rubout , which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with kb_a kb_character_(computing) that was kb_intention to kb_beryllium ignored . teletypes were commonly used for the less-expensive computers from kb_digital_equipment_corporation corporation , kb_sulfate these kb_systems_analysis had to use the kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance kb_key_(cryptography) and thus the del kb_code to erase the previous kb_character_(computing) . because of this , kb_declination kb_video terminals ( by default ) sent the del kb_code for the kb_key_(cryptography) marked `` backspace '' while the kb_key_(cryptography) marked `` kb_delete_key '' sent an kb_escape_character sequence , while many kb_other_(philosophy) terminals sent bs for the backspace kb_key_(cryptography) . the kb_unix kb_computer_terminal driver could only use kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_code to back up , this could kb_beryllium kb_set_(mythology) to bs `` or '' del , but not both , resulting in kb_a very kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) period of annoyance where you had to correct kb_it depending on what kb_computer_terminal you were using ( kb_modern_history kb_electron_shells using kb_readline kb_natural_language_understanding both kb_code_(cryptography) ) . the assumption that no kb_key_(cryptography) sent kb_a bs caused control+h to kb_beryllium used for kb_other_(philosophy) purposes , such as kb_a `` help '' kb_command_economy in emacs .many more of the control kb_code_(cryptography) have been given meanings quite different from their original ones . the `` escape '' kb_character_(computing) ( esc , kb_code 27 ) , for example , was kb_intention originally to allow sending kb_other_(philosophy) control kb_character_(computing) as literals instead of invoking their kb_meaning_(linguistics) . this is the same kb_meaning_(linguistics) of `` escape '' encountered in url encodings , kb_c_(programming_language) kb_string_section , and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_systems_analysis where certain kb_character_(computing) have kb_a reserved kb_meaning_(linguistics) . over kb_time_(magazine) this kb_meaning_(linguistics) has been co-opted and has eventually been changed . in kb_modern_history use , an esc sent to the kb_computer_terminal usually indicates the start of kb_a kb_command_economy sequence usually in the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_a so-called `` kb_ansi_escape_code kb_code '' ( or , more properly , kb_a `` kb_control_sequence_introducer sequence introducer '' ) from ecma-48 ( kb_1972_wimbledon_championships ) and its successors , beginning with esc followed by kb_a `` < nowiki > [ < /nowiki > '' ( left-bracket ) kb_character_(computing) . an esc sent from the kb_computer_terminal is most often used as an kb_out-of-band_data kb_character_(computing) used to terminate an operation , as in the kb_text_editor_and_corrector and kb_vi text editors . in kb_graphical_user_interface kb_user_(ancient_egyptian_official) interface ( kb_graphical_user_interface ) and kb_window_(computing) kb_systems_analysis , esc generally kb_causes_of_autism an kb_application_(computing) to abort its kb_electric_current operation or to kb_exit_(system_call) ( terminate ) altogether .the inherent ambiguity of many control kb_character_(computing) , combined with their historical usage , created kb_problems_(aristotle) when transferring `` kb_plain_text text '' kb_file_(tool) between kb_systems_analysis . the best example of this is the kb_newline problem on various operating kb_systems_analysis . kb_teleprinter machines required that kb_a kb_line_(geometry) of text kb_beryllium terminated with both `` kb_carriage_return return '' ( which moves the printhead to kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the kb_line_(geometry) ) and `` kb_line_feed '' ( which advances the paper kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_line_(geometry) without moving the printhead ) . the kb_toponymy `` kb_carriage_return return '' comes from the kb_fact that on kb_a kb_manual_(music) kb_typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the kb_positional_notation where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary . the entire carriage had to kb_beryllium pushed ( returned ) to the kb_right-wing_politics in kb_order_(biology) to kb_positional_notation the kb_left-wing_politics margin of the paper for the kb_next kb_line_(geometry) .kb_declination operating kb_systems_analysis ( kb_os/8 , kb_rt-11 , kb_rsx-11 , kb_rsts/e , kb_tops-10 , etc . ) used both kb_character_(computing) to kb_mark_waugh the end of kb_a kb_line_(geometry) kb_sulfate that the console kb_analyzer ( originally kb_teleprinter machines ) would kb_cold_working . by the kb_time_(magazine) so-called `` kb_glass ttys '' ( later called crts or terminals ) came along , the kb_fan_convention was kb_sulfate kb_water_well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the kb_fan_convention . when kb_gary_kildall kildall created kb_cp/m kb_he_(letter) was inspired by some kb_command_economy kb_line_(geometry) interface conventions used in kb_declination 's kb_rt-11 . until the introduction of kb_pc_dos kb_dos in 1981 , kb_ibm had no kb_hand in this because their 1970s operating kb_systems_analysis used kb_ebcdic instead of kb_ascii and they were oriented toward punch-card input and kb_line_(geometry) printer output on which the kb_concept of kb_carriage_return return was meaningless . kb_ibm 's kb_pc_dos kb_dos ( also marketed as kb_ms-dos by kb_microsoft ) inherited the kb_fan_convention by kb_virtue of kb_being loosely based on kb_cp/m , and kb_microsoft_windows inherited kb_it from kb_ms-dos .unfortunately , requiring kb_2_(number) kb_character_(computing) to kb_mark_waugh the end of kb_a kb_line_(geometry) introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each kb_character_(computing) when encountered alone . to simplify matters kb_plain_text text kb_big_data streams , including kb_file_(tool) , on kb_multics used kb_line_feed ( lf ) alone as kb_a kb_line_(geometry) kb_terminator_(solar) . kb_unix and kb_unix-like kb_systems_analysis , and kb_amiga kb_systems_analysis , kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome this kb_fan_convention from kb_multics . the original kb_macintosh_os , kb_apple_dos , and kb_prodos , on the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hand , used kb_carriage_return return ( cr ) alone as kb_a kb_line_(geometry) kb_terminator_(solar) ; however , since kb_apple_inc. replaced these operating kb_systems_analysis with the unix-based kb_macos kb_operating_system system , they now use kb_line_feed ( lf ) as kb_water_well . the kb_radio shack kb_trs-80 also used kb_a lone cr to terminate lines .computers attached to the kb_arpanet included machines running operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_tops-10 and kb_tops-20#tenex using cr-lf kb_line_(geometry) endings , machines running operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_multics using lf kb_line_(geometry) endings , and machines running operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_os/360 that represented lines as kb_a kb_character_(computing) count followed by the kb_character_(computing) of the kb_line_(geometry) and that used kb_ebcdic rather than kb_ascii . the kb_telnet protocol kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity an kb_ascii `` kb_network_virtual_terminal virtual kb_computer_terminal '' ( nvt ) , kb_sulfate that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and kb_character_(computing) sets could kb_beryllium kb_catalyst_support by transmitting kb_a standard text kb_text_formatting over the network . kb_telnet used kb_ascii along with cr-lf kb_line_(geometry) endings , and software using kb_other_(philosophy) conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt . the kb_file_transfer_protocol transfer protocol kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome the kb_telnet protocol , including use of the kb_network_virtual_terminal virtual kb_computer_terminal , for use when transmitting commands and transferring kb_big_data in the default kb_ascii kb_musical_mode . this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols , and to kb_other_(philosophy) network protocols , such as those used for e-mail and the kb_world_wide_web kb_world_wide_web , on kb_systems_analysis not using the nvt 's cr-lf line-ending kb_fan_convention .the pdp-6 monitor , and its pdp-10 successor kb_tops-10 , used control-z ( sub ) as an kb_end-of-file indication for input from kb_a kb_computer_terminal . some operating kb_systems_analysis such as kb_cp/m tracked file kb_length only in units of kb_disk_(mathematics) kb_periodic_table_block and used control-z to kb_mark_waugh the end of the actual text in the file . for these reasons , eof , or kb_end-of-file , was used colloquially and conventionally as kb_a kb_three-letter_acronym kb_acronym for control-z instead of substitute . the end-of-text kb_code ( kb_end-of-text_character ) , also known as kb_control-c , was inappropriate for kb_a kb_variety_(magazine) of reasons , while using kb_carboxybenzyl as the kb_control_code kb_code to end kb_a file is analogous to kb_it ending the kb_alphabet and serves as kb_a very convenient kb_mnemonic_device kb_aid . kb_a kb_history common and still prevalent kb_fan_convention uses the kb_end-of-text_character kb_code kb_fan_convention to interrupt and halt kb_a kb_program_(computing) via an input kb_data_stream , usually from kb_a keyboard .in kb_vitamin_c library and kb_unix conventions , the kb_null_character is used to terminate text kb_string_section ; such null-terminated kb_string_section can kb_beryllium known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz , where here kb_carboxybenzyl stands for `` kb_0_(number) '' .kb_other_(philosophy) representations might kb_beryllium used by specialist equipment , for example kb_iso_2047 graphics or kb_hexadecimal kb_grammatical_number .kb_code_(cryptography) 20 to 7e , known as the printable kb_character_(computing) , represent kb_letter_(alphabet) , digits , punctuation marks , and kb_a few kb_miscellaneous_symbols kb_symbols . there are 95 printable kb_character_(computing) in total .kb_code 20 , the `` kb_space '' kb_character_(computing) , denotes the kb_space between kb_lexical_semantics , as produced by the kb_space bar of kb_a keyboard . since the kb_space kb_character_(computing) is considered an invisible graphic ( rather than kb_a kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) ) kb_it is listed in the table kb_#ecclesiastical_history instead of in the previous kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) .kb_code 7f corresponds to the non-printable `` kb_delete_key '' ( del ) kb_control_character kb_character_(computing) and is therefore omitted from this chart ; kb_it is covered in the previous kb_section_(united_states_land_surveying) 's chart . kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet versions of kb_ascii used the up kb_arrow_(weapon) instead of the kb_caret ( 5e ) and the kb_left-wing_politics kb_arrow_(weapon) instead of the kb_underscore ( 5f ) .] ]kb_ascii was kb_first_trimester used commercially during 1963 as kb_a seven-bit kb_teleprinter kb_code for kb_american_telephone_&_telegraph & kb_telegraph 's twx ( teletypewriter exchange ) network . twx originally used the kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet five-bit kb_ita2 , which was also used by the competing kb_telex kb_teleprinter system . kb_robert_william_bemer bemer introduced features such as the kb_escape_character sequence . kb_histidine kb_kingdom_of_great_britain colleague kb_hugh_mcgregor_ross mcgregor ross helped to popularize this kb_cold_working according to bemer , `` kb_sulfate much kb_sulfate that the kb_code that was to become kb_ascii was kb_first_trimester called the `` bemer–ross kb_code '' in kb_europe '' . because of kb_histidine extensive kb_cold_working on kb_ascii , bemer has been called `` the kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) of kb_ascii '' .on kb_march 11 , kb_from_the_earth_to_the_moon_(miniseries)#episodes , kb_usa_davis_cup_team kb_president_of_the_united_states

recording the standard kb_code for kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) interchange on kb_magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in kb_apollo_guidance_computer operations .all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the kb_federal_government_of_the_united_states kb_inventory on and after july 1 , 1969 , must have the capability to use the standard kb_code for kb_information_(formal_criminal_charge) interchange and the formats prescribed by the kb_magnetic tape and kb_punched_tape tape kb_corporate_social_responsibility when these kb_medes are used .kb_ascii was the most common kb_character_encoding on the kb_world_wide_web kb_world_wide_web until december kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final , when kb_utf-8 encoding surpassed kb_it ; kb_utf-8 is kb_backward_compatibility compatible with kb_ascii .as kb_apollo_guidance_computer kb_technology kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) throughout the kb_world , different kb_standardization and corporations kb_adaptation many variations of kb_ascii to facilitate the expression of non-english languages that used roman-based alphabets . kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) could kb_class_(biology) some of these variations as `` kb_ascii extensions '' , although some misuse that kb_terminology to represent all variants , including those that do not preserve kb_ascii 's character-map in the 7-bit range . furthermore , the kb_ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as kb_ascii .from early in its development , kb_ascii was kb_intention to kb_beryllium just kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of several national variants of an international kb_character_(computing) kb_code standard .kb_other_(philosophy) international kb_standardization have ratified kb_character_(computing) encodings such as kb_iso_646 ( 1967 ) that are kb_identical_particles or nearly kb_identical_particles to kb_ascii , with extensions for kb_character_(computing) outside the kb_english_alphabet and kb_symbols used outside the united kb_sovereign_state , such as the kb_symbol for the kb_united_kingdom kb_kingdom_(biology) 's kb_pound_sterling ( kb_pound_sterling ) . almost every kb_country_music needed an adapted version of kb_ascii , since kb_ascii suited the needs of only the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) and kb_a few kb_other_(philosophy) countries . for example , kb_canada had its own version that kb_catalyst_support kb_france kb_character_(computing) .many kb_other_(philosophy) countries kb_adaptation variants of kb_ascii to include non-english kb_letter_(alphabet) ( e.g . kb_é , kb_ñ , kb_ß , kb_ł ) , kb_aruban_florin kb_symbols ( e.g . kb_pound_sterling , kb_¥ ) , etc . kb_episcopal_see also kb_yuscii ( yugoslavia ) .kb_it would share most kb_character_(computing) in common , but assign kb_other_(philosophy) locally useful kb_character_(computing) to several kb_code points reserved for `` national use '' . however , the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii-1963 and kb_international_organization_for_standardization 's kb_first_trimester acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused kb_ascii 's choices for the national use kb_character_(computing) to seem to kb_beryllium kb_de_facto kb_corporate_social_responsibility for the kb_world , causing kb_confusion and incompatibility once kb_other_(philosophy) countries did begin to make their own assignments to these kb_code points .iso/iec 646 , like kb_ascii , is kb_a 7-bit kb_character_(computing) kb_set_(mythology) . kb_it does not make any additional kb_code_(cryptography) kb_one-way_analysis_of_variance , kb_sulfate the same kb_code points encoded different kb_character_(computing) in different countries . escape kb_code_(cryptography) were kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity to indicate which national variant kb_applied_science to kb_a piece of text , but they were rarely used , kb_sulfate kb_it was often impossible to know what variant to kb_cold_working with and , therefore , which kb_character_(computing) kb_a kb_code represented , and in kb_general_(united_states) , text-processing kb_systems_analysis could kb_coping_(psychology) with only kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) variant anyway .because the bracket and kb_brace_(punctuation) kb_character_(computing) of kb_ascii were assigned to `` national use '' kb_code points that were used for accented kb_letter_(alphabet) in kb_other_(philosophy) national variants of iso/iec 646 , kb_a kb_german_language , kb_france , or kb_sweden , etc . kb_programmer using their national variant of iso/iec 646 , rather than kb_ascii , had to write , and thus kb_walter_read , something such asinstead ofkb_vitamin_c trigraphs were created to solve this problem for kb_ansi_c , although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use . many programmers kept their computers on us-ascii , kb_sulfate plain-text in kb_sweden , kb_german_language etc . ( for example , in e-mail or kb_usenet ) contained `` { , } '' and similar variants in the middle of kb_lexical_semantics , something those programmers got used to . for example , kb_a kb_sweden kb_programmer mailing another kb_programmer asking if they should kb_go_(game) for lunch , could get `` kb_neutron { jag har sm|rg } sar '' as the answer , which should kb_beryllium `` nä jag har smörgåsar '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` no kb_iodine 've got sandwiches '' .eventually , as 8- , kb_16-bit and kb_32-bit ( and later kb_64-bit ) computers began to replace kb_12-bit , kb_18-bit and kb_36-bit computers as the kb_norm_(mathematics) , kb_it became common to use an kb_8-bit kb_byte to store each kb_character_(computing) in kb_memory , providing an opportunity for extended , kb_8-bit relatives of kb_ascii . in most kb_noun_case these kb_adaptation as kb_truth extensions of kb_ascii , leaving the original character-mapping intact , but adding additional kb_character_(computing) definitions after the kb_first_trimester 128 ( i.e. , 7-bit ) kb_character_(computing) .encodings include kb_iscii ( kb_indian_subcontinent ) , kb_viscii ( kb_vietnam ) . although these encodings are sometimes referred to as kb_ascii , kb_truth kb_ascii is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity strictly only by the kb_american_national_standards_institute standard .most early home kb_computer_systems

underlayer if they want , and change the profile of the kb_arm . ''kb_3d_computer_graphics animation is kb_digital_media modeled and manipulated by an kb_animator . the kb_animator usually starts by creating kb_a 3d kb_polygon_mesh to manipulate . kb_a mesh typically includes many kb_vertex_(geometry) that are connected by edges and faces , which give the visual kb_appearance_(philosophy) of kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism to kb_a 3d kb_space_debris or 3d environment . sometimes , the mesh is given an internal kb_digital_data skeletal kb_structure called an kb_armature_(computer_animation) that can kb_beryllium used to control the mesh by weighting the kb_vertex_(geometry) . this process is called rigging and can kb_beryllium used in conjunction with keyframes to create kb_movement_(sign_language) .kb_other_(philosophy) techniques can kb_beryllium kb_applied_science , mathematical functions ( e.g. , kb_gravity_(2013_film) , kb_grammatical_particle simulations ) , simulated fur or hair , and effects , kb_fire_(classical_element) and kb_fluid_animationan kb_animator is an kb_artist kb_world_health_organization creates kb_a visual sequence ( or kb_audio-visual if added kb_sound ) of kb_cross-platform_software sequential images that generate the illusion of kb_movement_(sign_language) , that is , an animation . animations are currently in many areas of kb_technology and kb_video , such as kb_film , kb_television , kb_video_games or kb_the_internet kb_internet . generally , these works require the collaboration of several animators . the methods to create these images depend on the kb_animator and kb_carpel that kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) wants to achieve ( with images generated by kb_apollo_guidance_computer , manually ... ) .animators can kb_beryllium divided into animators of kb_character_(computing) ( artists kb_world_health_organization are specialized in the movements , kb_dialogue and acting of the kb_character_(computing) ) and animators of special effects ( for example vehicles , kb_machinery or kb_natural_number kb_phenomenon such as kb_water , kb_snow , kb_rain ) .the creation of non-trivial animation works ( i.e. , longer than kb_a few seconds ) has kb_adaptation as kb_a kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_filmmaking , with certain unique aspects . kb_trait_(biology) common to both live-action and animated kb_feature_film kb_adventure_film are labor-intensity and kb_high_middle_ages production costs .the most important difference is that once kb_a kb_film is in the production kb_phase_(matter) , the kb_marginal_cost cost of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) more shot is higher for animated kb_adventure_film than live-action kb_adventure_film . kb_it is relatively easy for kb_a director to kb_amplitude-shift_keying for kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) more kb_take during kb_principal_photography photography of kb_a live-action kb_film , but every kb_take on an animated kb_film must kb_beryllium manually rendered by animators ( although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by kb_modern_history kb_computer_animation ) . kb_it is pointless for kb_a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating kb_a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the kb_film . thus , animation studios starting with kb_walt_disney_animation_studios began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where kb_storyboard artists develop every kb_single_bond scene through storyboards , then handing the kb_film over to the animators only after the production team is kb_satisfiability that all the scenes make kb_word_sense as kb_a whole . while live-action kb_adventure_film are now also storyboarded , they enjoy more kb_latitude to depart from storyboards ( i.e. , kb_real-time_computing improvisation ) .another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain kb_a kb_film 's consistency from start to finish , even as kb_adventure_film have grown longer and teams have grown larger . animators , like all artists , necessarily have kb_individual kb_art_movement , but must subordinate their individuality in kb_a kb_consistent way to whatever kb_carpel is employed on kb_a kb_particular kb_film . since the early 1980s , teams of about 500 to 600 kb_people_(american_magazine) , of whom 50 to 70 are animators , typically have created feature-length animated kb_adventure_film . kb_it is relatively easy for kb_2_(number) or kb_triliteral artists to match their kb_art_movement ; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult .this problem is usually solved by having kb_a separate kb_group_(periodic_table) of visual development artists develop an overall kb_look_(american_magazine) and palette for each kb_film before animation begins . kb_character_(computing) designers on the visual development team draw kb_rutherford_model sheets to show how each kb_character_(computing) should kb_look_(american_magazine) like with different facial expressions , posed in different positions , and viewed from different angles . on traditionally animated projects , maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators kb_episcopal_see how kb_character_(computing) would kb_look_(american_magazine) from different angles .unlike live-action kb_adventure_film , animated kb_adventure_film were traditionally kb_adaptation beyond the synopsis stage through the kb_storyboard kb_text_formatting ; the kb_storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the kb_film . in the early kb_1960s_in_the_united_states , animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write kb_screenplays ( while also continuing to use story departments ) and kb_screenplays had become commonplace for animated kb_adventure_film by the late 1980s .criticism of animation has been common in kb_medes and kb_film since its kb_inception_(film) . with its popularity , kb_a kb_prespa_lake amount of criticism has arisen , especially animated kb_feature_film kb_adventure_film . many concerns of kb_cultural_anthropology kb_representation_(arts) , kb_psychology effects on children have been brought up around the animation kb_industry , which has remained rather kb_politics_of_albania unchanged and stagnant since its kb_inception_(film) into kb_mainstream_(terminology) kb_albanian_culture .as with any kb_other_(philosophy) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_medes , animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field . the original awards for animation were presented by the kb_academy_of_motion_picture_arts_and_sciences kb_motion_(physics) picture kb_arts and kb_sciences for animated shorts from the year 1932 , during the 5th kb_academy_awards kb_function_(biology) . the kb_first_trimester winner of the kb_academy_awards was the short `` kb_flowers_and_trees and kb_trees '' , kb_a production by kb_walt_disney_productions kb_walt_disney_animation_studios productions . the kb_academy_awards for kb_a feature-length animated kb_motion_(physics) picture was only instituted for the year 2001 , and awarded during the 74th kb_academy_awards in 2002. kb_it was won by the kb_film `` kb_shrek '' , produced by kb_dreamworks and kb_pacific_data_images images . disney/pixar have produced the most kb_adventure_film either to win or kb_beryllium nominated for the award . the kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of both awards can kb_beryllium obtained here :several kb_other_(philosophy) countries have instituted an award for best-animated kb_feature_film as part of their national kb_film awards : kb_africa_movie_academy_award_for_best_animation kb_academy_awards for best animation ( since kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 ) , kb_bafta_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film ( since kb_winter_olympics_2006 ) , kb_césar_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film ( since 2011 ) , kb_golden_rooster_award_for_best_animation award for best animation ( since 1981 ) , kb_goya_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film ( since 1989 ) , kb_japan_academy_prize_for_animation_of_the_year prize for animation of the year ( since kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final ) , kb_national_film_award_for_best_animated_film kb_film award for best animated kb_film ( since kb_winter_olympics_2006 ) . also since kb_2007_uefa_champions_league_final , the kb_asia_pacific_screen_award_for_best_animated_feature_film kb_screening_(medicine) award for best animated kb_feature_film has been awarded at the kb_asia_pacific_screen_awards kb_screening_(medicine) awards . since kb_2009_in_science , the kb_european_film_awards awards have awarded the kb_european_film_award_for_best_animated_film award for best animated kb_film .the kb_annie_award award is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation . unlike the kb_academy_awards , the annie awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any kb_other_(philosophy) field of technical and artistic endeavor . they were re-organized in kb_1992_davis_cup to create kb_a kb_new_world field for best animated kb_i_shot_andy_warhol . the 1990s winners were dominated by walt kb_walt_disney_animation_studios , however , newer studios , kb_light-emitting_diode by kb_pixar & kb_dreamworks , have now begun to consistently vie for this award . the kb_list_of_asteraceae_genera of awardees is as follows :category : cartooningcategory : kb_article_(grammar) containing kb_video kb_clips_(software)category : kb_film and kb_video technologyapollokb_apollo_program ( kb_attica , kb_ionic_crystal , and kb_homeric_greek : , `` apollōn '' ( ) ;

, `` phoibos '' ) , literally `` bright '' . kb_it was very commonly used by both the kb_greeks and kb_roman_empire for kb_apollo_program 's role as the kb_god of kb_light . like kb_other_(philosophy) kb_ancient_greek kb_deities , kb_he_(letter) had kb_a kb_grammatical_number of others kb_applied_science to him , reflecting the kb_variety_(magazine) of roles , duties , and aspects ascribed to the kb_god . however , while kb_apollo_program has kb_a great kb_grammatical_number of appellations in kb_greek_mythology , only kb_a few occur in kb_latin_literature .kb_apollo_program 's birthplace was kb_cynthus cynthus on the kb_island of kb_deloskb_delphi and kb_actiumkb_apollo_program was worshipped throughout the kb_roman_empire . in the traditionally kb_celts lands , kb_he_(letter) was most often seen as kb_a kb_healing and kb_sun kb_god . kb_he_(letter) was often equated with kb_list_of_celtic_godsthe kb_cult_(religious_practice) centers of kb_apollo_program in kb_greece , kb_delphi and kb_delos , date from the 8th century bce . the kb_delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to kb_artemis , kb_apollo_program 's twin sister . at kb_delphi , kb_apollo_program was kb_veneration as the slayer of kb_pytho . for the kb_greeks , kb_apollo_program was all the kb_deity in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) and through the kb_century_(cricket) kb_he_(letter) acquired different functions which could originate from different kb_deity . in kb_archaic_greece kb_greece kb_he_(letter) was the kb_prophet , the kb_oracular kb_god kb_world_health_organization in older times was connected with `` kb_healing '' . in kb_classical_greece kb_he_(letter) was the kb_god of kb_light and of kb_music , but in popular kb_religion kb_he_(letter) had kb_a kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_function_(biology) to keep away kb_evil . kb_walter_burkert burkert discerned kb_triliteral components in the kb_prehistory of kb_apollo_program kb_achilles#worship , which kb_he_(letter) termed `` kb_a dorian-northwest kb_ancient_greek component , kb_a cretan-minoan component , and kb_a syro-hittite component . ''from kb_histidine kb_eastern_hemisphere kb_evolution kb_apollo_program brought the kb_art of kb_inspection of `` kb_symbols and kb_omen '' ( σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα : `` sēmeia kai terata '' ) , and of the kb_observation of the omens of the days . the inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from kb_anatolia . the kb_ritualism_in_the_church_of_england belonged to kb_apollo_program from kb_operation_barbarossa beginning . the kb_greeks created the kb_legalism_(western_philosophy) , the supervision of the kb_order_(biology) of the kb_deity , and the demand for kb_moderation and kb_harmony . kb_apollo_program became the kb_god of shining youth , kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_beauty , kb_fine_(penalty) kb_arts , kb_philosophy , kb_moderation , spiritual-life , the protector of

of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to kb_cure kb_disease . later the kb_greeks knew the original kb_meaning_(linguistics) of the relevant song `` kb_paean '' ( ) . the magicians were also called `` seer-doctors '' ( ) , and they used an ecstatic prophetic kb_art which was used exactly by the kb_god kb_apollo_program at the kb_oracle_machine .in the `` kb_iliad '' , kb_apollo_program is the healer under the kb_deity , but kb_he_(letter) is also the bringer of kb_disease and kb_death with kb_histidine arrows , similar to the kb_function_(biology) of the kb_vedas kb_god of kb_disease kb_rudra . kb_he_(letter) sends kb_a kb_plague_(disease) ( ) to the kb_achaeans_(homer) . the kb_god kb_world_health_organization sends kb_a kb_disease can also prevent kb_it ; therefore , when kb_it kb_organ_stop , they make kb_a purifying ceremony and offer him kb_a kb_hecatomb to ward off kb_evil . when the kb_oath of kb_histidine kb_priest appeases , they pray and with kb_a song they call their own kb_god , the `` kb_paean '' .some common epithets of kb_apollo_program as kb_a healer are `` paion '' ( literally `` healer '' or `` helper '' ) `` epikourios '' ( , `` succouring '' ) , `` oulios '' ( , `` healer , baleful '' ) and `` loimios '' ( , `` of kb_the_plague kb_plague_(disease) '' ) . in kb_classical_antiquity , kb_histidine kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_function_(biology) in popular kb_religion was to keep away kb_evil , and was therefore called `` apotropaios '' ( , `` averting kb_evil '' ) and `` alexikakos '' ( `` keeping off ill '' ; from kb_verb + kb_noun ) . in later writers , kb_the_word_(free_love) word , usually spelled `` kb_paean '' , becomes kb_a mere kb_epithet of kb_apollo_program in kb_histidine capacity as kb_a kb_god of kb_healing .kb_homer illustrated paeon the kb_god , and the song both of kb_apotropaic_magic kb_thanksgiving_day_(united_states) or triumph . such songs were originally addressed to kb_apollo_program , and afterwards to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_deity : to kb_dionysus , to kb_helios , to kb_apollo_program 's son kb_asclepius the healer . about the 4th century bce , the kb_paean became merely kb_a kb_chemical_formula of adulation ; its kb_space_debris was either to implore protection against kb_disease and misfortune , or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered . kb_it was in this way that kb_apollo_program had become recognised as the kb_god of kb_music . kb_apollo_program 's role as the slayer of the kb_python_(mythology) kb_light-emitting_diode to kb_histidine kb_continental_association with kb_battle_abbey and victory ; hence kb_it became the kb_roman_empirethe connection with the dorians and their initiation festival `` kb_apellai '' is reinforced by the month `` apellaios '' in northwest kb_ancient_greek calendars . the family-festival was dedicated to kb_apollo_program ( kb_dorians : ) . `` apellaios '' is the month of these rites , and apellon is the `` megistos kb_kouros '' ( the great kb_kouros ) . however kb_it can explain only the kb_dorians kb_type_(biology) of the kb_toponymy , which is connected with the kb_ancient_macedonian_language word `` kb_pella '' ( kb_pella ) , `` stone '' . stones played an important part in the kb_cult_(religious_practice) of the kb_god , especially in the kb_oracular shrine of kb_delphi ( kb_omphalos ) .the `` kb_homeric_hymn '' represents kb_apollo_program as kb_a kb_northern_hemisphere intruder . kb_histidine kb_arrival_(abba_album) must have occurred during the `` kb_greek_dark_ages ages '' that followed the destruction of the kb_mycenaean_civilization , and kb_histidine conflict with kb_gaia ( mother kb_earth ) was represented by the legend of kb_histidine slaying her kb_decay_product the serpent kb_python_(mythology) .the kb_earth kb_deity had kb_power_(physics) over the ghostly kb_world , and kb_it is believed that she was the kb_deity behind the kb_oracle . the older tales mentioned kb_2_(number) dragons kb_world_health_organization were perhaps intentionally conflated . kb_a female dragon kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_delphyne ( ; kb_cf. . , `` kb_womb '' ) , and kb_a kb_male serpent kb_typhon ( ; from , `` to smoke '' ) , the adversary of kb_zeus in the kb_titanomachy , kb_world_health_organization the narrators confused with kb_python_(mythology) . kb_python_(mythology) was the good kb_daemon_(classical_mythology) ( ἀγαθὸς δαίμων ) of the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina as kb_it appears in kb_minoan_civilization kb_religion , but she was represented as kb_a dragon , as often happens in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_european_folklore as kb_water_well as in the kb_east_africa .kb_apollo_program and kb_histidine sister kb_artemis can bring kb_death with their arrows . the kb_human_fertilization that diseases and kb_death come from invisible kb_shot_(filmmaking) sent by kb_supernatural beings , or magicians is common in kb_germanic_languages and kb_norse_mythology kb_mythology . in kb_greek_mythology kb_artemis was the kb_leader ( , `` kb_hegemon '' ) of the kb_nymphs , kb_world_health_organization had similar functions with the kb_norse_mythology kb_elf . the `` elf-shot '' originally indicated kb_disease or kb_death attributed to the kb_elf , but kb_it was later attested denoting stone arrow-heads which were used by witches to harm kb_people_(american_magazine) , and also for kb_healing rituals .the kb_vedas kb_rudra has some similar functions with kb_apollo_program . the terrible kb_god is called `` the kb_archery '' , and the kb_bow_river is also an attribute of kb_shiva . kb_rudra could bring diseases with kb_histidine arrows , but kb_he_(letter) was able to free kb_people_(american_magazine)

from the kb_mycenaean_greece age . in historical times , the kb_priests of kb_delphi were called kb_labëria ( kb_alkyl ) yadai , `` the double-axe men '' , which indicates kb_minoan_civilization kb_evolution . the double-axe , kb_labrys , was the holy kb_symbol of the kb_crete kb_labyrinth . the kb_homeric_hymn adds that kb_apollo_program appeared as kb_a kb_dolphin and carried kb_crete kb_priests to kb_delphi , where they evidently transferred their kb_religion practices . `` kb_apollo_program delphinios '' or `` delphidios '' was kb_a sea-god especially worshiped in kb_crete and in the kb_islands_(regional_unit) . kb_apollo_program 's sister kb_artemis , kb_world_health_organization was the kb_ancient_greek kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of hunting , is kb_interpretatio_graeca with kb_britomartis ( kb_diktynna ) , the kb_minoan_civilization `` mistress of the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing '' . in her kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century depictions she is accompanied by the `` mister of the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing '' , kb_a kb_male kb_god of hunting kb_world_health_organization had the kb_bow_river as kb_histidine attribute . kb_histidine original kb_toponymy is unknown , but kb_it seems that kb_he_(letter) was absorbed by the more popular kb_apollo_program , kb_world_health_organization stood by the virgin `` mistress of the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing '' , becoming her brother .the kb_old_testament kb_oracle_machine in kb_delphi seem to kb_beryllium connected with kb_a local kb_tradition of the kb_priesthood , and there is not clear kb_evidence_(law) that kb_a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina . this kb_light-emitting_diode some scholars to the kb_eschatocol that kb_pythia carried on the rituals in kb_a kb_consistent procedure through many kb_century_(cricket) , according to the local kb_tradition . in that regard , the mythical seeress kb_sibyl of kb_sultanate_of_rum kb_evolution , with her ecstatic kb_art , looks unrelated to the kb_oracle itself . however , the kb_ancient_greek_astronomy is referring to the kb_existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves , which seem to kb_beryllium kb_confirmation by recent studies .kb_plato describes the priestesses of kb_delphi and kb_dodona as frenzied women , obsessed by `` kb_mania '' ( , `` kb_frenzy '' ) , kb_a kb_ancient_greek word kb_he_(letter) connected with `` mantis '' ( , `` kb_prophet '' ) . frenzied women like sibyls from whose lips the kb_god speaks are recorded in the kb_near_east kb_east_africa as kb_mari,_syria in the kb_2nd_millennium_bc bc . although kb_crete had contacts with kb_mari,_syria from 2000 bc , there is no kb_evidence_(law) that the ecstatic prophetic kb_art existed during the kb_minoan_civilization and kb_mycenaean_greece ages . kb_it is more probable that this kb_art was introduced later from kb_anatoliakb_a non-greek kb_evolution of kb_apollo_program has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) been assumed in scholarship . the kb_toponymy of kb_apollo_program 's mother kb_leto has kb_lydian_language kb_evolution , and she was worshipped on the coasts of kb_anatolia . the inspiration kb_oracular kb_cult_(religious_practice) was probably introduced into kb_greece from kb_anatolia , which is the kb_evolution of kb_sibyl , and where existed some of the oldest kb_oracular shrines . omens , kb_symbols , purifications , and exorcisms appear in kb_old_testament assyro-babylonian kb_literature , and these rituals were kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) into the kb_roman_empire of the kb_hittites . in kb_a kb_hittites text is mentioned that the kb_king invited kb_a babylonian priestess for kb_a certain `` purification '' .kb_a similar story is mentioned by kb_plutarch . kb_he_(letter) writes that the kb_crete kb_prophet kb_epimenides purified kb_athens after the pollution brought by the kb_alcmeonidae , and that the kb_prophet 's expertise in sacrifices and kb_reform_judaism of funeral practices were of great help to kb_solon in kb_histidine kb_reform_judaism of the kb_athenian kb_state_of_matter . the story indicates that kb_epimenides was probably heir to the kb_shamanism#asia religions of kb_asia_(roman_province) , and proves , together with the kb_homeric_hymn , that kb_crete had kb_a resisting kb_religion up to historical times . kb_it seems that these rituals were dormant in kb_greece , and they were reinforced when the kb_greeks migrated to kb_anatolia .kb_homer pictures kb_apollo_program on the side of the kb_troy , fighting against the kb_achaeans_(homer) , during the kb_trojan_war . kb_he_(letter) is pictured as kb_a terrible kb_god , less trusted by the kb_greeks than kb_other_(philosophy) kb_deity . the kb_god seems to kb_beryllium related to `` appaliunas '' , kb_a tutelary kb_god of kb_wilusa ( kb_troy ) in kb_anatolia , but kb_the_word_(free_love) word is not complete . the stones found in front of the gates of kb_homeric kb_troy were the kb_symbols of kb_apollo_program . kb_a kb_western_esotericism kb_sultanate_of_rum kb_evolution may also kb_beryllium bolstered by references to the parallel kb_achilles#worship of `` artimus '' ( kb_artemis ) and `` qλdãns '' , whose kb_toponymy may kb_beryllium kb_cognate with the kb_hittites and kb_dorians kb_theory_of_forms , in surviving kb_lydian_language kb_literature '' . '' however , recent scholars have kb_casting_(metalworking) doubt on the identification of `` qλdãns '' with kb_apollo_program .the kb_greeks gave to him the kb_toponymy `` kb_agyieus '' as the protector kb_god of kb_state_school places and houses kb_world_health_organization wards off kb_evil , and kb_histidine kb_symbol was kb_a tapered stone or kb_column_of_antoninus_pius . however , while usually kb_ancient_greek festivals were celebrated at the kb_full_moon kb_moon , all the feasts of kb_apollo_program were celebrated at the seventh day of the month , and the kb_emphasis_(typography) given to that day ( `` sibutu '' ) indicates kb_a babylonian kb_evolution .the kb_bronze_age#age_sub-divisions kb_bronze_age ( from 1700 to 1200 bce ) kb_hittites and kb_hurrian `` kb_aplu_(deity) '' was kb_a kb_god of kb_plague_(disease) , invoked during kb_plague_(disease) years . here we have an kb_apotropaic_magic situation , where kb_a kb_god originally bringing kb_the_plague kb_plague_(disease) was invoked to end kb_it . kb_aplu_(deity) , kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` the son of '' , was kb_a kb_title given to the kb_god kb_nergal , kb_world_health_organization was linked to the babylonian kb_solar_deity the kb_sun kb_shamash . kb_homer interprets kb_apollo_program as kb_a terrible kb_god ( ) kb_world_health_organization brings kb_death and kb_disease with kb_histidine arrows , but kb_world_health_organization can also heal , possessing kb_a kb_magic_(supernatural) kb_art that separates him from the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_ancient_greek kb_deity . in `` kb_iliad '' , kb_histidine kb_priest prays to `` kb_apollo_smintheus '' , the kb_mouse kb_god kb_world_health_organization retains an older kb_agriculture kb_function_(biology) as the protector from field rats . all these functions , including the kb_function_(biology) of the healer-god kb_paeanunusually among the kb_summer_olympics kb_deities , kb_apollo_program had kb_2_(number) kb_cult_(religious_practice) sites that had widespread influence : kb_delos and kb_delphi . in kb_cult_(religious_practice) practice , kb_delos kb_apollo_program and kb_pythian_apollo kb_apollo_program ( the kb_apollo_program of kb_delphi ) were kb_sulfate distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality . kb_apollo_program 's kb_cult_(religious_practice) was already fully established when written sources commenced , about 650 bce . kb_apollo_program became extremely important to the kb_ancient_greek kb_world as an kb_oracular kb_deity in the kb_archaic_greece period , and the kb_frequency of kb_theophoric_names names such as `` apollodorus '' or `` apollonios '' and cities kb_english_alphabet#letter_names `` kb_sozopol '' testify to kb_histidine popularity . kb_oracular sanctuaries to kb_apollo_program were established in kb_other_(philosophy) sites . in the 2nd and 3rd century kb_council_of_europe , those at kb_didyma and kb_clarus pronounced the so-called `` theological kb_oracle_machine '' , in which kb_apollo_program confirms that all kb_deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing , highest kb_deity . `` in the 3rd century , kb_apollo_program fell silent . kb_julian_the_apostate apostatekb_apollo_program had kb_a famous kb_oracle in kb_delphi , and kb_other_(philosophy) notable ones in kb_clarus and kb_branchidae . kb_histidine kb_oracular shrine in kb_abae in kb_phocis , where kb_he_(letter) bore the toponymic kb_epithet `` kb_abaeus '' ( , `` kb_apollon_smyrni_f.c. abaios '' ) , was important enough to kb_beryllium consulted by kb_croesus .kb_histidine kb_oracular shrines include :kb_oracle_machine were also given by sons of kb_apollo_program .many kb_egyptian_temple were dedicated to kb_apollo_program in kb_greece and the kb_greek_colonies . they show the kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) of the kb_cult_(religious_practice) of kb_apollo_program and the kb_evolution of the kb_ancient_greek kb_architecture , which was mostly based on the rightness of kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism and on mathematical kb_foreign_relations_of_albania . some of the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century kb_egyptian_temple , especially in kb_crete , do not belong to any kb_ancient_greek kb_order_(biology) . kb_it seems that the kb_first_trimester peripteral kb_egyptian_temple were rectangular wooden kb_structural_analysis . the different wooden kb_chemical_element were considered kb_divinity , and their kb_theory_of_forms were preserved in the kb_marble or stone kb_chemical_element of the kb_egyptian_temple of kb_doric_order . the kb_greeks used standard types because they believed that the kb_world of kb_object_relations_theory was kb_a series of typical kb_theory_of_forms which could kb_beryllium represented in several instances . the kb_egyptian_temple should kb_beryllium canonic , and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection . from the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century times there were certain kb_biological_rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle kb_buildings . the kb_first_trimester kb_buildings were built narrowly in kb_order_(biology) to hold the roof , and when the kb_dimensional_analysis changed some mathematical kb_foreign_relations_of_albania became necessary in kb_order_(biology) to keep the original kb_theory_of_forms . this probably influenced the kb_theory of kb_grammatical_number of kb_pythagoras , kb_world_health_organization believed that behind the kb_appearance_(philosophy) of things there was the permanent kb_principle_(chemistry) of kb_mathematics .the kb_doric_order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century bc but there was kb_a mathematical problem regarding the kb_positional_notation of the triglyphs , which could n't kb_beryllium solved without changing the original kb_theory_of_forms . the kb_order_(biology) was almost abandoned for the kb_ionic_order , but the kb_ionic_crystal kb_list_of_australian_capital_cities also posed an kb_insoluble problem at the corner of kb_a kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina . both kb_order_(biology) were abandoned for the kb_corinthian_order kb_order_(biology)when kb_zeus ' wife kb_hera discovered that kb_leto was impregnanted by kb_zeus , she banned kb_leto from giving birth on `` kb_solid_earth '' . in her wanderings , kb_leto sought shelter on many lands , only to kb_beryllium rejected by them . finally , she saw kb_delos , kb_a floating kb_island , which was neither kb_a real kb_island nor kb_a mainland . kb_it is said that kb_apollo_program , still in kb_leto 's kb_womb , had informed kb_histidine mother about kb_delos to put an end to her suffering . kb_leto , when welcomed by kb_delos , gave birth there , clinging to kb_a kb_palm_tree .kb_it is also stated that kb_hera kidnapped kb_eileithyiawhen kb_apollo_program was born clutching kb_a kb_golden_eagle kb_sword , the swans circled kb_delos seven times and the kb_nymphs sang in delight . soon after kb_he_(letter) was born , kb_he_(letter) was washed clean by the goddesses and was covered in kb_white_american garment , with kb_golden_eagle bands fastened around him . since kb_leto was unable to kb_animal_feed the kb_new_world born , kb_themis , the kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of kb_divinity kb_law , fed him the kb_nectar_(plant) , or kb_ragweed . upon tasting the kb_divinity kb_food_industry , kb_apollo_program broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that kb_he_(letter) would kb_beryllium the kb_master's_degree of kb_lyrekb_leto was kb_acceptance#self_acceptance by the kb_people_(american_magazine) of kb_delos and she promised them that her son would kb_beryllium always favorable towards kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey . afterwards , kb_zeus secured kb_delos to the bottom of the kb_oceanus . this kb_island later became kb_sacred_architecture to kb_apollo_program .kb_apollo_program was born on the seventh day ( , `` hebdomagenes '' ) of the month kb_thargelion —according to delian tradition—or of the month bysios—according to delphian kb_tradition . the seventh and twentieth , the days of the kb_new_world and kb_full_moon kb_moon , were ever afterwards held kb_sacred_architecture to him . mythographers agree that kb_artemis was born kb_first_trimester and subsequently assisted with the birth of kb_apollo_program , or that kb_artemis was born on the kb_island of kb_ortygia and that she helped kb_leto cross the kb_sea_(astronomy) to kb_delos the kb_next day to give birth to kb_apollo_program .as kb_a child , kb_apollo_program is said to have built kb_a kb_foundation_(engineering) and an altar on kb_delos using the horns of the goats that kb_histidine sister kb_artemis hunted . since kb_he_(letter) learnt the kb_art of building when kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , kb_he_(letter) later became ``

kb_zeus did n't agree and instead exiled kb_histidine son from kb_mount_olympus , and instructed him to get purified . kb_apollo_program had to serve as kb_a slave for nine years . after the servitude was over , as per kb_histidine kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) 's kb_order_(biology) kb_apollo_program travelled to the kb_vale_of_tempe of tempe to kb_bath,_somerset in waters of kb_pineios_(thessaly) . there kb_zeus himself performed purification rites on kb_apollo_program . purified , kb_apollo_program was escorted by kb_histidine half sister kb_athena to kb_delphi where the kb_oracular shrine was finally handed over to him by kb_gaea . according to kb_a variation , kb_apollo_program had also travelled to kb_crete , where kb_carmanor_(deity) had to perform purification rites on him .

the same extent as kb_zeus by mortals . due to this kb_zeus wished to destroy him . but kb_apollo_program requested kb_histidine kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) not to kb_women's_suffrage kb_sulfate ,

, everyone became frenzied with joy . this kb_light-emitting_diode kb_marsyas to think that kb_he_(letter) was better than kb_apollo_program , and kb_he_(letter) challenged the kb_god to kb_a musical contest . the contest was judged by the kb_musesafter they each performed , both were deemed equal until kb_apollo_program decreed they play and sing at the same kb_time_(magazine) . kb_marsyas argued against this , saying that kb_apollo_program would have an advantage . but kb_apollo_program presented the kb_counterpoint that since kb_marsyas played the kb_flute , which needed

wives of the kb_dioscuri ) , kb_athena_parthenos ( turned into kb_a kb_constellation upon her kb_death ) and by some accounts , kb_scylla .additionally , kb_apollo_program fostered and educated kb_2060_chiron , the kb_centaur_(minor_planet) kb_world_health_organization later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods , including kb_apollo_program 's sons . kb_apollo_program also fostered kb_carnus , the son of kb_zeus and kb_europa_(mythology) .kb_marpessa was kidnapped by kb_idas but was loved by kb_apollo_program as kb_water_well . kb_zeus made her choose between them , and she chose kb_idas on the grounds that kb_apollo_program , kb_being kb_immortality , would tire of her when she grew kb_old_testament .kb_sinope_(mythology) , kb_a kb_nymph , was approached by the amorous kb_apollo_program . she made him promise that kb_he_(letter) would kb_ulysses_s._grant to her whatever she would kb_amplitude-shift_keying for , and then cleverly asked him to let her stay kb_a virgin . kb_apollo_program kept kb_histidine promise and went back .kb_bolina was admired by kb_apollo_program but she refused him and jumped into the kb_sea_(astronomy) . to avoid her kb_death , kb_apollo_program turned her into kb_a kb_nymph and let her kb_go_(game) .kb_castalia was kb_a kb_nymph whom kb_apollo_program loved . she fled from him and kb_dove into the kb_castalian_spring at kb_delphi , at the kb_base_(chemistry) of mt . parnassos , which was then kb_english_alphabet#letter_names after her . kb_water from this kb_castalian_spring was kb_sacred_architecture ; kb_it was used to clean the delphian kb_egyptian_temple and inspire the priestesses .kb_cassandra , was kb_a kb_decay_product of kb_hecuba and kb_priam . kb_apollo_program wished to kb_court her . kb_cassandra promised to return kb_histidine kb_love on kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) condition - kb_he_(letter) should give her the kb_power_(physics) to kb_episcopal_see the future . kb_apollo_program fulfilled her wish , but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after . angered that she broke her promise , kb_apollo_program cursed her that even though she would kb_episcopal_see the future , no kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) would ever kb_believe_(tv_series) her prophecies .kb_hestiakb_artemis as the sister of kb_apollo_program , is `` thea apollousa '' , that is , she as kb_a female kb_divinity represented the same idea that kb_apollo_program did as kb_a kb_male kb_divinity . in the pre-hellenic period , their relationship was described as the kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) between husband and wife , and there seems to have been kb_a kb_tradition which actually described kb_artemis as the wife of kb_apollo_program . however , this relationship was never sexual but kb_spirituality , which is why they both are seen kb_being unmarried in the kb_hellenic_periodkb_artemis , like her brother , is kb_weapon with kb_a kb_bow_river and arrows . she is the cause of sudden kb_maternal_death of women . she also is the protector of the kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , especially girls . though she has nothing to do with kb_oracle_machine , kb_music or kb_poetry , she sometimes kb_light-emitting_diode the female kb_greek_chorus on kb_mount_olympus while kb_apollo_program sang . the kb_bay_laurel was kb_sacred_architecture to both . `` kb_artemis daphnaia '' had her kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina among the lacedemonians , at kb_a kb_place_of_articulation called hypsoi . in later times when kb_apollo_program was regarded as kb_identical_particles with the kb_sun or kb_helios , kb_artemis was naturally regarded as selene or the kb_moon .the kb_bay_laurel was kb_sacred_architecture to both . `` kb_apollo_program daphnephoros '' had kb_a kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina in kb_eretria , kb_a `` kb_place_of_articulation where the citizens are to kb_take the oaths .kb_hecate , the kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of kb_witchcraft and kb_magic_(supernatural) , is the kb_chthonic counterpart of kb_apollo_program . they both are cousins , since their mothers - kb_leto and kb_asteria_(titaness)the oldest kb_evidence_(law) found for kb_hecate 's kb_achilles#worship is at kb_apollo_program 's kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina in kb_miletos . there , kb_hecate was taken to kb_beryllium kb_apollo_program 's sister counterpart in the absence of kb_artemis . kb_hecate 's kb_moon kb_nature makes her the kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of the waning kb_moon and contrats and complements , at the same kb_time_(magazine) , kb_apollo_program 's solar kb_nature .as kb_a kb_deity of kb_knowledge_representation and kb_great_power kb_power_(physics) , kb_apollo_program was seen kb_being the kb_male counterpart of kb_athena . kb_being kb_zeus ' favorite children , they were given more powers and duties . kb_apollo_program and kb_athena often took up the role as protectors of cities , and were patrons of some of the important cities . kb_athena was the kb_principle_(chemistry) kb_wiccan_views_of_divinity of kb_athens , kb_apollo_program was the kb_principle_(chemistry) kb_god of kb_spartaas patrons of kb_arts , kb_apollo_program and kb_athena were companions of the kb_muses , the former kb_a much more frequent companion than the latter . kb_apollo_program was sometimes called the son of kb_athena and kb_hephaestus due to kb_histidine wise and artistic kb_nature .in the kb_trojan_war , as kb_zeus ' kb_executive_(government) , kb_apollo_program is seen holding the kb_aegis like kb_athena usually does . kb_apollo_program 's decisions were usually approved by kb_histidine sister kb_athena , and they both worked to establish kb_the_law_(1849_book) kb_law and kb_order_(biology) kb_set_(mythology) forth by kb_zeus .in kb_aeschylus ' `` kb_oresteia '' trilogy , kb_clytemnestra kills her husband , kb_king kb_agamemnon because kb_he_(letter) had sacrificed their kb_decay_product kb_iphigenia to proceed forward with the kb_trojan_war . kb_apollo_program gives an kb_order_(biology) through the kb_oracle at kb_delphi that kb_agamemnon 's son , kb_orestes , is to kill kb_clytemnestra and kb_aegisthus , her lover . kb_orestes and pylades carry out the revenge , and consequently kb_orestes is pursued by the kb_erinyes or furies ( female kb_anthropomorphism of kb_revenge ) .kb_apollo_program and the furies argue about whether the kb_matricide was justified ; kb_apollo_program holds that the kb_chemical_bond of kb_marriage is kb_sacred_architecture and kb_orestes was avenging kb_histidine kb_leonard_huxley_(writer) , whereas the kb_erinyes say that the kb_chemical_bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the kb_chemical_bond of kb_marriage . they invade kb_histidine kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina , and kb_he_(letter) drives them away . kb_he_(letter) says that the kb_matter should kb_beryllium brought before kb_athena . kb_apollo_program promises to protect kb_orestes , as kb_orestes has become kb_apollo_program 's kb_supplication . kb_apollo_program advocates kb_orestes at kb_the_trial kb_jury_trial , and ultimately kb_athena kb_biological_rules in favor of kb_apollo_program .the kb_roman_empire kb_achilles#worship of kb_apollo_program was kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome from the kb_greeks . as kb_a quintessentially kb_list_of_greek_mythological_figures , kb_apollo_program had no direct kb_roman_empire kb_cognate , although later kb_roman_empire poets often referred to him as phoebus . there was kb_a kb_tradition that the kb_pythia kb_oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kb_roman_kingdom kb_roman_empire during the reign of kb_tarquinius_superbus superbus .on the occasion of kb_a pestilence in the 430s bce , kb_apollo_program 's kb_temple_of_apollo_sosianus at kb_roman_empire was established in the flaminian fields , replacing an older kb_cult_(religious_practice) site there known as the `` apollinare '' . during the kb_second_punic_war kb_war in 212 bce , the `` kb_ludi_apollinares apollinares '' ( `` apollonian games '' ) were instituted in kb_histidine honor , on the instructions of kb_a kb_prophecy attributed to kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) marcius . in the kb_time_(magazine) of kb_augustus , kb_world_health_organization considered himself under the special protection of

kb_deity of kb_roman_empire .after the kb_battle_of_actium kb_actium , which was fought near kb_a sanctuary of kb_apollo_program , kb_augustus enlarged kb_apollo_program 's kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina , dedicated kb_a portion of the spoils to him , and instituted kb_quinquennial games in kb_histidine kb_honour . kb_he_(letter) also erected kb_temple_of_apollo_(palatine) kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina to the kb_god on the kb_palatine_hill kb_hill . sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to kb_apollo_program and kb_diana_(mythology) formed the culmination of the kb_secular_games , held in 17 bce to celebrate the dawn of kb_a kb_new_world era .the kb_tribal_chief apollonian festival was the kb_pythian_games games held every four years at kb_delphi and was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the four great kb_panhellenic_games games . also of kb_major_(united_states) importance was the kb_delia_(festival) held every four years on kb_delos .kb_athenian kb_annual_plant festivals included the kb_boedromia , kb_metageitnia , kb_pyanepsia , and kb_thargelia .spartan kb_annual_plant festivals were the kb_carneia and the kb_hyacinthia .kb_thebes_(greece) every nine years held the kb_daphnephoria .kb_apollo_program 's most common kb_attribute_(role-playing_games) were the kb_bow_river and kb_arrow_(weapon) . kb_other_(philosophy) kb_attribute_(role-playing_games) of kb_histidine included the kb_kithara ( an advanced version of the common kb_lyre ) , the kb_plectrum and the kb_sword . another common emblem was the kb_sacrificial_tripod tripod , representing kb_histidine prophetic powers . the kb_pythian_games games were held in kb_apollo_program 's honor every four years at kb_delphi . the kb_bay_laurel kb_bay_laurel kb_plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the kb_laurel_wreath of victorythe kb_palm_tree was also kb_sacred_architecture to kb_apollo_program because kb_he_(letter) had been born under kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) in kb_delos . kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing kb_sacred_architecture to kb_apollo_program included kb_gray_wolf , dolphins , kb_roe_deer kb_deer , swans , cicadas ( symbolizing kb_music and song ) , hawks , ravens , crows , kb_snakes ( referencing kb_apollo_program 's kb_function_(biology) as the kb_god of kb_prophecy ) , mice and griffinsas kb_god of colonization , kb_apollo_program gave kb_oracular guidance on kb_abraham_lincoln_on_slavery#colonization , especially during the height of colonization , 750–550 bce . according to kb_ancient_greek_astronomy , kb_he_(letter) helped kb_crete or arcadian kb_colonies_in_antiquity found kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_troy . however , this story may reflect kb_a kb_cultural_anthropology influence which had the kb_obverse_and_reverse direction : kb_hittites kb_cuneiform kb_literature mention kb_a minor kb_asian_people kb_god called `` appaliunas '' or `` apalunas '' in connection with kb_the_city_of_london kb_list_of_cities_in_turkey of kb_wilusa attested in kb_hittites kb_inscriptiones_graecae , which is now generally regarded as kb_being kb_identical_particles with the kb_ancient_greek kb_troy by most scholars . in this kb_interpretation_(logic) , kb_apollo_program 's kb_title of `` lykegenes '' can simply kb_beryllium kb_walter_read as `` born in kb_lycia '' , which effectively severs the kb_god 's supposed link with kb_gray_wolf ( possibly kb_a kb_folk_etymology ) .in literary contexts , kb_apollo_program represents kb_harmony , kb_order_(biology) , and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of kb_dionysus , kb_god of kb_wine , kb_world_health_organization represents ecstasy and disorder . the kb_contrast_(vision) between the roles of these kb_deity is reflected in the adjectives kb_apollonian_and_dionysian and dionysian . however , the kb_greeks thought of the kb_2_(number) qualities as complementary : the kb_2_(number) kb_deity are kb_monk , and when kb_apollo_program at kb_winter kb_left-wing_politics for kb_hyperborea , kb_he_(letter) would leave the kb_pythia kb_oracle to kb_dionysus . this kb_contrast_(vision) appears to kb_beryllium shown on the kb_2_(number) sides of the kb_borghese_vase vase .kb_apollo_program is often associated with the kb_golden_mean_(philosophy) . this is the kb_ancient_greek kb_ideal_(ring_theory) of kb_moderation and kb_a kb_virtue that opposes kb_gluttonykb_apollo_program is kb_a common kb_theme_(byzantine_district) in kb_ancient_greek and kb_roman_empire kb_art and also in the kb_art of the kb_renaissance . the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century kb_ancient_greek word for kb_a kb_statue is `` delight '' ( , `` agalma '' ) , and the sculptors tried to create kb_theory_of_forms which would inspire such guiding kb_computer_vision . kb_ancient_greek kb_art puts into kb_apollo_program the highest kb_degree_(angle) of kb_power_(physics) and kb_beauty that can kb_beryllium imagined . the sculptors kb_derived_trait this from kb_observations_(pierre_belon) on kb_human_kind , but they also kb_embodied_agent in kb_concrete kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , issues beyond the reach of kb_ordinary_(officer) thought .the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the kb_cult_(religious_practice) of the kb_human_body that was essentially kb_a kb_religion activity . the muscular frames and kb_limb_(anatomy) combined with slim waists indicate the kb_ancient_greek desire for health , and the kb_health capacity which was necessary in the hard kb_ancient_greek environment . the statues of kb_apollo_program embody kb_beauty , kb_formal_balance and inspire awe before the kb_beauty of the kb_world .the kb_evolution of the kb_ancient_greek kb_sculpture can kb_beryllium observed in kb_histidine depictions from the almost static formal kb_kouros kb_type_(biology) in kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period , to the kb_representation_(arts) of kb_motion_(physics) in kb_a relative harmonious whole in kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period . in kb_classical_greece the kb_emphasis_(typography) is not given to the illusive kb_imagination kb_reality represented by the kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_theory_of_forms , but to the analogies and the kb_interaction of the members in the whole , kb_a method created by kb_polykleitos . finally kb_praxiteles seems to kb_beryllium released from any kb_art and kb_religion conformities , and kb_histidine masterpieces are kb_a kb_mixture of kb_realism_(arts) with stylization .the kb_evolution of the kb_ancient_greek kb_art seems to kb_go_(game) parallel with the kb_ancient_greek kb_philosophy conceptions , which changed from the natural-philosophy of kb_thales to the kb_metaphysics kb_theory of kb_pythagoras . kb_thales searched for kb_a kb_simple_polygon material-form directly perceptible by the senses , behind the appearances of things , and kb_histidine kb_theory is also related to the older kb_animism . this was paralleled in kb_sculpture by the kb_absolute_morality kb_representation_(arts) of vigorous kb_life_(magazine) , through unnaturally simplified kb_theory_of_forms .kb_pythagoras believed that behind the kb_appearance_(philosophy) of things , there was the permanent kb_principle_(chemistry) of kb_mathematics , and that the kb_theory_of_forms were based on kb_a kb_transcendental_number mathematical relation . the kb_theory_of_forms on kb_earth , are imperfect imitations ( , `` eikones '' , `` images '' ) of the celestial kb_world of kb_grammatical_number . kb_histidine kb_idea had kb_a great influence on post-archaic kb_art . the kb_ancient_greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation , that would kb_lead to the esthetic perfection . ( kb_aesthetic_canon ) .in kb_classical_greece , kb_anaxagoras asserted that kb_a kb_divinity kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving ( kb_mind ) gave kb_order_(biology) to the seeds of the kb_universe , and kb_platokb_kouros ( `` kb_male youth '' ) is the kb_modern_history kb_terminology given to those representations of standing kb_male youths which kb_first_trimester appear in the kb_archaic_period_in_greece in kb_greece . this kb_type_(biology) served certain kb_religion needs and was kb_first_trimester kb_anatolian_hypothesis for what was previously thought to kb_beryllium depictions of `` kb_apollo_program '' . the kb_first_trimester statues are certainly still and formal . the formality of their stance seems to kb_beryllium related with the kb_egyptian_language kb_stare_decisis , but kb_it was kb_acceptance#self_acceptance for kb_a good kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving . the sculptors had kb_a clear idea of what kb_a kb_thomas_young_(scientist) man is , and kb_embodied_agent the archaic smile of good manners , the firm and springy step , the kb_formal_balance of the kb_human_body , dignity , and youthful kb_happiness . when they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men , kb_it was because men had common kb_semitic_root with the unchanging kb_deity . the adoption of kb_a standard recognizable kb_type_(biology) for kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_time_(magazine) , is probably because kb_nature gives preference in survival of kb_a kb_type_(biology) which has kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_beryllium kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by the kb_climatic conditions , and also due to the kb_general_(united_states) kb_ancient_greek belief that kb_nature expresses itself in `` kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_theory_of_forms '' that can kb_beryllium imagined and represented . these kb_theory_of_forms expressed immortality . kb_apollo_program was the kb_immortality kb_god of `` kb_ideal_(ring_theory) kb_formal_balance and kb_order_(biology) '' . kb_histidine shrine in kb_delphiin the kb_first_trimester large-scale depictions during the kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period ( 640–580 bc ) , the artists tried to draw kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's attention to kb_look_(american_magazine) into the interior of the face and the kb_human_body which were not represented as lifeless masses , but as kb_being full of kb_life_(magazine) . the kb_greeks maintained , until late in their kb_civilization_(series) , an almost kb_animism idea that the statues are in some kb_word_sense alive . this embodies the belief that the image was somehow the kb_god or man himself . kb_a kb_fine_(penalty) example is the kb_statue of the `` kb_sacred_gate kb_kouros '' which was found at the cemetery of kb_dipylon in kb_athens ( kb_dipylon_kouros ) . the kb_statue is the `` kb_object_(philosophy) kb_thing-in-itself itself '' , and kb_histidine slender face with the deep eyes express an kb_intellectual kb_eternity . according to the kb_ancient_greek_astronomy the kb_dipylon was kb_english_alphabet#letter_names kb_daedalusthe kb_animism idea as the kb_representation_(arts) of the kb_imagination kb_reality , is sanctified in the kb_homeric poems and in kb_ancient_greek kb_egyptian_mythology , in stories of the kb_god kb_hephaestus ( kb_phaistos ) and the mythic kb_daedalus ( the builder of the kb_labyrinth ) that made images which moved of their own accord . this kind of kb_art goes back to the kb_minoan_civilization period , when its main kb_theme_(byzantine_district) was the kb_representation_(arts) of kb_motion_(physics) in kb_a specific moment . these free-standing statues were usually kb_marble , but also the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism rendered in kb_limestone , kb_bronze_age , kb_ivory and kb_terracotta .the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century examples of life-sized statues of kb_apollo_program , may kb_beryllium kb_2_(number) figures from the kb_ionic_crystal sanctuary on the kb_island of kb_delos . such statues were found across the kb_ancient_greek speaking kb_world , the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of kb_apollo_program with more than kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) hundred from the sanctuary of `` kb_apollo_program ptoios '' , kb_boeotia alone . the last stage in the development of the `` kb_kouros kb_type_(biology) '' is the kb_archaic_period_in_greece kb_archaic_greece period ( 520–485 bc ) , in which the kb_ancient_greek kb_sculpture attained kb_a full kb_knowledge_representation of kb_human_body and used to create kb_a relative harmonious whole . ranking from the very few bronzes survived to kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) is the masterpiece kb_bronze_age kb_piraeus_apollo . kb_it was found in kb_piraeus , the kb_harbour of kb_athens . the kb_statue originally held the kb_bow_river in its kb_left-wing_politics kb_hand , and kb_a cup of pouring libation in its kb_right-wing_politics kb_hand . kb_it probably comes from north-eastern kb_peloponnesus . the kb_emphasis_(typography) is given in kb_comparative_anatomy , and kb_it is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester attempts to represent kb_a kind of kb_motion_(physics) , and kb_beauty relative to proportions , which appear mostly in post-archaic kb_art . the kb_statue kb_throw_(grappling) some kb_light on an artistic centre which , with an independently kb_adaptation harder , simpler and heavier kb_carpel , restricts kb_ionian_greeks influence in kb_athens . finally , this is the germ from which the kb_art of kb_polykleitosat kb_operation_barbarossa beginning of the kb_classical_greece , kb_it was considered that kb_beauty in visible things as in everything else , consisted of kb_symmetry and proportions . the artists tried also to represent kb_motion_(physics) in kb_a specific moment ( kb_myron ) , which may kb_beryllium considered as the reappearance of the dormant kb_minoan_civilization kb_chemical_element . kb_comparative_anatomy and kb_geometry are fused in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) , and each does something to the kb_other_(philosophy) . the kb_ancient_greek sculptors tried to clarify kb_it by looking for mathematical proportions , just as they sought some kb_reality behind appearances . kb_polykleitos in kb_histidine `` kb_aesthetic_canon '' wrote that kb_beauty consists in the kb_hierarchical_proportion not of the kb_chemical_element ( materials ) , but of the parts , that is the interrelation of parts with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) another and with the whole . kb_it seems that kb_he_(letter) was influenced by the kb_theories of kb_pythagoras .the famous `` kb_apollo_program of kb_mantua '' and its variants are early kb_theory_of_forms of the kb_apollo_citharoedus kb_statue kb_type_(biology) , in which the kb_god holds the kb_cithara in kb_histidine kb_left-wing_politics kb_arm . the kb_type_(biology) is represented by kb_neo-attic kb_ottoman_empire kb_roman_empire copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century , modelled upon kb_a supposed kb_ancient_greek kb_bronze_age original made in the kb_second quarter of the 5th century bce , in kb_a kb_carpel similar to works of kb_polykleitos but more archaic . the kb_apollo_program held the `` cythara '' against kb_histidine extended kb_left-wing_politics kb_arm , of which in the louvre example , kb_a fragment of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) twisting scrolling kb_french_horn upright remains against kb_histidine biceps .though the proportions were always important in kb_ancient_greek kb_art , the kb_appeal of the kb_ancient_greek sculptures eludes any explanation by kb_hierarchical_proportion alone . the statues of kb_apollo_program were thought to kb_incarnation kb_histidine living presence , and these representations of illusive kb_imagination kb_reality had deep kb_semitic_root in the kb_minoan_civilization period , and in the kb_orthodoxy of the kb_first_trimester kb_ancient_greekin the archaic pediments and friezes of the kb_egyptian_temple , the artists had kb_a problem to fit kb_a kb_group_(periodic_table) of figures into an isosceles kb_triangle_(musical_instrument) with acute angles at the kb_base_(chemistry) .the kb_siphnian_treasury treasury in kb_delphi was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester kb_ancient_greek kb_buildings utilizing the kb_solid_solution to put the dominating kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism in the middle , and to complete the descending scale of height with kb_other_(philosophy) figures sitting or kneeling . the pediment shows the story of kb_heracles stealing kb_apollo_program 's tripod that was strongly associated with kb_histidine kb_oracular inspiration . their kb_2_(number) figures hold the centre . in the pediment of the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina of kb_zeus in kb_olympia_(manet)these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the kb_human_eye for their own visible sake . they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in kb_space , but only as parts in kb_a larger whole . while each scene has its own kb_character_(computing) and completeness kb_it must fit into the kb_general_(united_states) sequence to which kb_it belongs . in these archaic pediments the sculptors use kb_empty_string intervals , to suggest kb_a passage to and from kb_a busy battlefield . the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical kb_pattern and kb_order_(biology) , and this was improved when kb_classical_conditioning kb_art brought kb_a greater kb_freedom and kb_economy_of_alaska .kb_apollo_program as kb_a handsome beardless kb_thomas_young_(scientist) man , is often depicted with kb_a kb_kithara ( as kb_apollo_citharoedus ) or kb_bow_river in kb_histidine kb_hand , or reclining on kb_a kb_tree ( the kb_apollo_lykeios and kb_apollo_sauroctonos types ) . the kb_apollo_belvedere is kb_a kb_marble kb_sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century ; for kb_century_(cricket) kb_it epitomized the ideals of kb_classical_antiquity for europeans , from the kb_renaissance through the kb_rilindja_kombëtare century . the kb_marble is kb_a kb_hellenistic_period or kb_roman_empire copy of kb_a kb_bronze_age original by the kb_ancient_greek kb_sculptor_(constellation) kb_leochares , made between 350 and 325 bce .the life-size so-called `` kb_adonis '' found in 1780 on the site of kb_a `` kb_roman_villa '' near the via labicana in the kb_roman_empire suburb of centocelle is kb_interpretatio_graeca as an kb_apollo_program by kb_modern_history scholars . in the late 2nd century kb_council_of_europe floor kb_mosaic from kb_el_djem , kb_roman_empire `` thysdrus '' , kb_he_(letter) is identifiable as kb_helios by kb_histidine effulgent kb_halo_(religious_iconography) , though now even kb_a kb_god 's kb_divinity kb_nudity is concealed by kb_histidine cloak , kb_a kb_mark_waugh of increasing conventions of modesty in the later kb_roman_empire .another haloed kb_apollo_program in kb_mosaic , from kb_hadrumentum , is in the kb_museum at kb_sousse . the conventions of this kb_representation_(arts) , kb_human_head tilted , lips slightly parted , large-eyed , curling kb_hairstyle cut in locks kb_grazing the kb_neck , were kb_adaptation in the 3rd century bce to depict kb_alexander_the_great great . some kb_time_(magazine) after this kb_mosaic was kb_execution_(computing) , the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century depictions of kb_jesus_christ would also kb_beryllium beardless and haloed .kb_apollo_program has often featured in postclassical kb_art and kb_ancient_egyptian_literature . kb_percy_bysshe_shelley bysshe shelley composed kb_a `` hymn of kb_apollo_program '' ( 1820 ) , and the kb_god 's instruction of the kb_muses formed the kb_grammatical_subject of kb_igor_stravinsky stravinsky 's `` kb_apollon_musagète '' ( 1927–1928 ) . in 1978 , the kb_canadians band kb_rush_(band) released kb_hemispheres_(rush_album) kb_purple_rain_(album) with songs `` kb_apollo_program : bringer of wisdom '' / '' kb_dionysus : bringer of kb_love '' .in discussion of kb_the_arts kb_arts , kb_a distinction is sometimes made between the kb_apollonian_and_dionysian and dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing kb_intellectual kb_order_(biology) and the latter with chaotic creativity . kb_friedrich_nietzsche nietzsche argued that kb_a fusion of the kb_2_(number) was most desirable . kb_carl_jung jung 's kb_apollo_archetype represents what kb_he_(letter) saw as the disposition in kb_people_(american_magazine) to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional kb_distance .kb_charles_handy handy , in `` kb_deity of kb_management '' ( 1978 ) uses kb_ancient_greek kb_deity as kb_a metaphor to portray various types of kb_organizational_culture kb_albanian_culture . kb_apollo_program represents kb_a 'role ' kb_albanian_culture where kb_order_(biology) ,

, and kb_cambodia come together ) , and that the kb_family_(biology) is not as kb_old_testament as frequently assumed , dating to perhaps 2000 bce . peiros ( 2011 ) criticized sidwell 's kb_theory heavily and calls kb_it kb_a bunch of contradictions . kb_he_(letter) show with kb_histidine kb_analysis that the kb_urheimat of austroasiatic is somewhere near the kb_yangtze . kb_he_(letter) suggests the kb_sichuan_basin as likely kb_urheimat of proto-austroasiatic before they migrated to kb_other_(philosophy) parts of kb_central_europe and kb_south_china and than into kb_southeast_asia . kb_he_(letter) further suggests that the kb_family_(biology) must kb_beryllium as kb_old_testament as proto-austronesian and proto-sinotibetan or even older .georg van driem ( 2011 ) proposes that the kb_urheimat of austroasiatic is somewhere in kb_south_china . kb_he_(letter) suggests that the kb_region around the kb_pearl_river_(china) kb_river ( kb_china ) is the likely kb_urheimat of the kb_austroasiatic_languages languages and kb_people_(american_magazine) . kb_he_(letter) further suggests , based on kb_heredity studies , that the migration of kb_kra–dai_languages

kb_other_(philosophy) geneticists criticise the kb_zhivotovsky_method method .kb_roger_blench kb_roger_blench ( kb_2009_in_science ) also proposes that there might have been kb_other_(philosophy) kb_primary_education kb_branches_of_science of austroasiatic that are now kb_extinct , based on kb_substratum kb_evidence_(law) in modern-day languages .kb_other_(philosophy) languages with

kb_indo-gangetic_plain plain , and were then absorbed by kb_indo-aryan_languages at an early date as kb_indo-aryan_languages kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) kb_east_africa . peterson notes that kb_eastern_hemisphere kb_indo-aryan_languageskb_paul_sidwell ( kb_2009_in_science ) , in kb_a kb_lexicostatistical comparison of 36 languages which are kb_water_well known enough to exclude loan kb_lexical_semantics , finds little kb_evidence_(law) for internal branching , though kb_he_(letter) did find an kb_area of increased contact between the kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages , such that languages of all kb_branches_of_science apart from the kb_geography_of_albania distant kb_munda_languages and kb_nicobarese_languages show greater similarity to kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages the closer they are to those kb_branches_of_science , without any noticeable innovations common to kb_bahnaric_languages and kb_katuic_languages .kb_he_(letter) therefore takes the kb_conservative view that the thirteen kb_branches_of_science of austroasiatic should kb_beryllium treated as equidistant on kb_electric_current kb_evidence_(law) . sidwell & kb_roger_blench ( 2011 ) discuss this proposal in more detail , and note that there is good kb_evidence_(law) for kb_a khasi–palaungic kb_cladistics , which could also possibly kb_beryllium closely related to khmuic .if this would the case , sidwell & kb_roger_blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) westward . sidwell & kb_roger_blench ( 2011 ) suggest kb_shompen_language as an additional branch , and kb_believe_(tv_series) that kb_a vieto-katuic connection is worth investigating . in kb_general_(united_states) , however , the kb_family_(biology) is thought to have diversified too quickly for kb_a deeply nested kb_structure to have kb_adaptation , since proto-austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the kb_central_europe kb_mekong_river kb_valley relatively quickly .subsequently , sidwell ( 2015a : 179 ) kb_anatolian_hypothesis that kb_nicobarese_languages subgroups with kb_aslian_languages , just as how khasian and palaungic subgroup with each kb_other_(philosophy) . kb_a subsequent computational kb_phylogenetics kb_analysis of the austroasiatic kb_language_family by sidwell ( 2015b ) suggests that austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science may have kb_a loosely nested kb_structure rather than kb_a completely rake-like kb_structure , with an east-west kb_division_(mathematics) ( consisting of kb_munda_languages , khasic , palaungic , and khmuic forming kb_a kb_western_esotericism kb_group_(periodic_table) as opposed to all of the kb_other_(philosophy) kb_branches_of_science ) occurring possibly as early as 7,000 years before present .integrating computational kb_phylogenetics kb_linguistics with recent kb_archaeology findings , kb_paul_sidwell ( 2015c ) further expanded kb_histidine kb_mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into kb_indochina from the kb_lingnan kb_area of kb_south_china , with the subsequent kb_mekong riverine dispersal taking kb_place_of_articulation after the initial kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_neolithic farmers from kb_south_china .sidwell ( 2015c ) tentatively suggests that austroasiatic may have begun to split up 5,000 years b.p . during the kb_neolithic_transition era of kb_mainland_southeast_asia kb_southeast_asia , with all the kb_major_(united_states) kb_branches_of_science of austroasiatic formed by 4,000 b.p . austroasiatic would have had kb_2_(number) possible dispersal routes from the kb_western_esotericism kb_peripheral_nervous_system of the kb_pearl_river_(china) kb_river kb_drainage_divide of kb_lingnan , which would have been either kb_a kb_coastal route down the kb_coast of kb_vietnam , or downstream through the kb_mekong_river via kb_yunnan . both the reconstructed kb_lexicon of proto-austroasiatic and the kb_archaeology record clearly show that early austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers around 4,000 b.p . cultivated kb_rice and kb_millet , kept kb_livestock such as dogs , pigs , and kb_chickens , and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than kb_coastal environments .at 4,500 b.p. , this `` kb_neolithic package '' suddenly arrived in kb_indochina from the kb_lingnan kb_area without kb_cereal kb_cereal and displaced the kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet pre-neolithic kb_hunter-gatherer cultures , with kb_cereal husks found in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_indochina by 4,100 b.p . and in kb_southern_europe kb_indochina by 3,800 b.p . however , sidwell ( 2015c ) found that kb_iron is not reconstructable in proto-austroasiatic , since each austroasiatic branch has different terms for kb_iron that had been kb_loanword relatively lately from tai , kb_chinese_characters , tibetan , kb_malay_language , and kb_other_(philosophy) languages .during the kb_iron_age about 2,500 b.p. , relatively kb_thomas_young_(scientist) austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science in kb_indochina such as kb_vietic_languages , kb_katuic_languages , kb_pearic_languages , and kb_khmer_alphabet were formed , while the more internally diverse kb_bahnaric_languages branch ( dating to about 3,000 b.p . ) underwent more extensive internal diversification . by the kb_iron_age , all of the austroasiatic kb_branches_of_science were more or less in their present-day locations , with most of the diversification within austroasiatic taking kb_place_of_articulation during the kb_iron_age .kb_paul_sidwell ( 2018 ) considers the austroasiatic kb_language_family to have rapidly diversified around 4,000 years b.p . during the kb_arrival_(abba_album) of kb_rice kb_agriculture in kb_indochina , but notes that the kb_evolution of proto-austroasiatic itself is older than that date . the kb_lexicon of proto-austroasiatic can kb_beryllium divided into an early and late stratum . the early stratum consists of kb_base_(chemistry) kb_lexicon including kb_human_body parts , kb_animal names , kb_natural_number features , and pronouns , while the names of kb_cultural_anthropology items ( kb_agriculture terms and kb_lexical_semantics for kb_cultural_anthropology kb_artifact_(archaeology) , which are reconstructable in proto-austroasiatic ) kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism part of the later stratum .kb_roger_blench kb_roger_blench ( 2017 ) suggests that vocabulary related to kb_aquatic_plant subsistence strategies ( such as boats , waterways , kb_river kb_fauna , and kb_fish capture techniques ) , can kb_beryllium reconstructed for proto-austroasiatic . kb_roger_blench ( 2017 ) finds widespread austroasiatic kb_semitic_root for 'river , kb_valley ' , 'boat ' , 'fish ' , 'catfish sp . ' , 'eel ' , 'prawn ' , 'shrimp ' ( kb_central_europe austroasiatic ) , 'crab ' , 'tortoise ' , 'turtle ' , 'otter ' , 'crocodile ' , 'heron , kb_fishing kb_bird ' , and 'fish trap ' . kb_archaeology kb_evidence_(law) for the presence of kb_agriculture in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_indochina ( kb_northern_hemisphere kb_vietnam , kb_laos , and kb_other_(philosophy) nearby areas ) dates back to only about 4,000 years b.p . ( 2,000 b.c . ) , with kb_agriculture ultimately kb_being introduced from further up to the kb_north in the kb_yangtze kb_valley where kb_it has been dated to 6,000 b.p .hence , this points to kb_a relatively late riverine dispersal of austroasiatic as compared to kb_sino-tibetan_languages , whose kb_appledesign_powered_speakers had kb_a distinct non-riverine kb_albanian_culture . in kb_addition to living an aquatic-based kb_lifestyle_(sociology) , early austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers would have also had access to kb_livestock , crops , and newer types of watercraft . as early austroasiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways , they would have encountered kb_appledesign_powered_speakers of older kb_language_family kb_world_health_organization were already kb_second_greek_colonisation in the kb_area , such as kb_sino-tibetan_languages .kb_other_(philosophy) than latin-based alphabets , many kb_austroasiatic_languages languages are written with the kb_khmer_alphabet , kb_thai_alphabet , kb_lao_alphabet , and kb_burmese_alphabet alphabets . kb_vietnamese_australian divergently had an kb_indigenous_peoples script based on kb_chinese_characters logographic writing . this has since been supplanted by the kb_latin_alphabet in the 20th century . the following are examples of past-used alphabets or kb_electric_current alphabets of kb_austroasiatic_languages languages .according to chaubey et al. , `` austro-asiatic kb_appledesign_powered_speakers in kb_indian_subcontinent today are kb_derived_trait from dispersal from kb_southeast_asia , followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local kb_indian_people populations . '' according to riccio et al. , the kb_munda_languages kb_people_(american_magazine) are likely descended from austroasiatic migrants from kb_southeast_asia .according to zhang et al. , austroasiatic migrations from kb_southeast_asia into kb_indian_subcontinent took kb_place_of_articulation after the kb_last_glacial_maximum glacial maximum , circa 10,000 years ago . arunkumar et kb_aluminium .

1860s , the main constituent kb_chemical_element within the broader kb_afroasiatic_languages kb_family_(biology) had been worked out .kb_friedrich_müller_(linguist) müller introduced the kb_toponymy `` hamito-semitic '' for the entire kb_family_(biology) in kb_histidine `` grundriss der sprachwissenschaft '' ( 1876 ) . kb_maurice_delafosse delafosse ( 1914 ) later kb_neologism the kb_terminology `` kb_afroasiatic_languages '' ( often now spelled `` kb_afro-asiatic_languages '' ) . however , kb_it did not come into kb_general_(united_states) use until kb_joseph_greenberg greenberg ( 1950 ) formally kb_anatolian_hypothesis its adoption . in doing kb_sulfate , greenberg sought to emphasize the kb_fact that kb_afroasiatic_languages spanned the kb_the_americas of both kb_africa and kb_asia_(roman_province) .kb_individual scholars have also called the kb_family_(biology) `` erythraean '' ( tucker 1966 ) and `` lisramic '' ( hodge kb_1972_wimbledon_championships ) . in lieu of `` hamito-semitic '' , the kb_russian_alphabet linguist kb_igor_diakonoff diakonoffscholars generally treat the kb_afroasiatic_languages kb_language_family as including the following kb_branches_of_science :although there is kb_general_(united_states) kb_agreement_(linguistics) on these six kb_family_(biology) , kb_linguistics kb_world_health_organization kb_science kb_afroasiatic_languages raise some points of disagreement , in kb_particular :in the 9th century , the kb_hebrew_alphabet grammarian kb_judah_ibn_kuraish ibn kb_quraysh of kb_tiaret in kb_algeria was the kb_first_trimester to link kb_2_(number) kb_branches_of_science of kb_afroasiatic_languages together ; kb_he_(letter) perceived kb_a relationship between kb_berber_languages and

kb_rilindja_kombëtare century , europeans also began suggesting such relationships . in 1844 , kb_theodor_benfey benfey suggested kb_a kb_language_family consisting of kb_semitic_languages , kb_berber_languages , and kb_cushitic_languages ( calling the latter `` kb_ge'ez_language '' ) . in the same year , t.n . newman suggested kb_a relationship between kb_semitic_languages and kb_hausa_people , but this would kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) remain kb_a kb_topic_(linguistics) of kb_cleveland_browns_relocation_controversy and kb_uncertainty .kb_friedrich_müller_(linguist) müller kb_english_alphabet#letter_names the traditional hamito-semitic kb_family_(biology) in 1876 in kb_histidine `` grundriss der sprachwissenschaft '' ( `` outline

kb_egyptian_language , kb_berber_languages , and kb_cushitic_languages ; kb_he_(letter) excluded the kb_chadic_languages kb_group_(periodic_table) . kb_it was the kb_egyptology kb_karl_richard_lepsius richard lepsius ( 1810–1884 ) kb_world_health_organization restricted hamitic to the non-semitic languages in kb_africa , which are characterized by kb_a kb_grammatical_gender kb_grammatical_gender system . this `` hamitic kb_language kb_group_(periodic_table) '' was kb_anatolian_hypothesis to unite various , mainly north-african , languages , including the kb_ancient_egyptian_medicine kb_language , the kb_berber_languages , the kb_cushitic_languages , the kb_beja_language kb_language , and the kb_chadic_languages . unlike müller , lepsius considered that kb_hausa_people and kb_nama_languagein 1912 , kb_carl_meinhof meinhof published `` die sprachen der hamiten '' ( `` the languages of the hamites '' ) , in which kb_he_(letter) expanded lepsius 's kb_rutherford_model , adding the kb_fula_language , kb_maasai_language , kb_bari_language , kb_nandi_languages , kb_sandawe_language and kb_hadza_people languages to the hamitic kb_group_(periodic_table) . meinhof 's kb_rutherford_model was widely kb_catalyst_support into the kb_1940s . meinhof 's system of kb_statistical_classification of the hamitic languages was based on kb_a belief that `` kb_appledesign_powered_speakers of hamitic became largely coterminous with kb_cattle herding kb_people's_party_of_armenia with essentially caucasian origins , intrinsically different from and superior to the 'negroes of kb_africa ' . '' however , in the case of the so-called kb_nilo-hamitic_languages languages ( kb_a kb_concept kb_he_(letter) introduced ) , kb_it was based on the kb_linguistic_typology kb_i_shot_andy_warhol of gender and kb_a `` fallacious kb_theory of kb_mixed_language . '' meinhof did this although kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet kb_cold_working by scholars such as lepsius and johnston had substantiated that the languages which kb_he_(letter) would later dub `` nilo-hamitic '' were in kb_fact nilotic languages , with numerous similarities in vocabulary to kb_other_(philosophy) nilotic languages .kb_leo_reinisch reinisch ( 1909 ) had already kb_anatolian_hypothesis linking kb_cushitic_languages and kb_chadic_languages , while urging their more distant affinity with kb_egyptian_language and kb_semitic_languages . however , kb_histidine suggestion found little acceptance . kb_marcel_cohen kb_paul_cohen ( 1924 ) rejected the idea of kb_a distinct `` hamitic '' subgroup , and included kb_hausa_people ( kb_a kb_chadic_languages kb_language ) in kb_histidine comparative hamito-semitic vocabulary . finally , kb_joseph_greenberg greenberg 's 1950 kb_cold_working kb_light-emitting_diode to the widespread rejection of `` hamitic '' as kb_a kb_language category by kb_linguistics . greenberg refuted meinhof 's kb_linguistic_anthropology kb_theories , and rejected the use of kb_race_(classification_of_human_beings) and kb_social_anarchism kb_evidence_(law) . in dismissing the notion of kb_a separate `` nilo-hamitic '' kb_language category in kb_particular , greenberg was `` returning to kb_a view widely held kb_a half century kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet . '' kb_he_(letter) consequently rejoined meinhof 's so-called kb_nilo-hamitic_languages languages with their appropriate nilotic siblings . kb_he_(letter) also added ( and sub-classified ) the kb_chadic_languages , and kb_anatolian_hypothesis the kb_new_world kb_toponymy kb_afroasiatic_languages for the kb_family_(biology) . kb_almost_all all scholars have kb_acceptance#self_acceptance this kb_statistical_classification as the kb_new_world and continued consensus .greenberg 's kb_rutherford_model was fully kb_adaptation in kb_histidine book `` kb_the_languages_of_africa languages of kb_africa '' ( 1963 ) , in which kb_he_(letter) reassigned most of meinhof 's additions to hamitic to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_language_family , notably kb_nilo-saharan . following kb_isaac_schapera schapera and rejecting meinhof , kb_he_(letter) classified the kb_hottentot_language kb_language as kb_a member of the kb_khoisan_languages languages , kb_a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of kb_click_consonant sounds . to khoisan kb_he_(letter) also added the tanzanian kb_hadza_people and kb_sandawe_language , though this view has been discredited as kb_linguistics working on these languages consider them to kb_beryllium kb_language_isolate . despite this , greenberg 's kb_statistical_classification remains kb_a starting point for kb_modern_history kb_cold_working of many languages spoken in kb_africa , and the hamitic category ( and its kb_extension_(kinesiology) to nilo-hamitic ) has no part in this .since the kb_triliteral traditional kb_branches_of_science of the hamitic languages ( kb_berber_languages , kb_cushitic_languages and kb_egyptian_language ) have not been shown to kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism an exclusive ( kb_monophyly ) kb_phylogenetics kb_units_of_measurement of their own , separate from kb_other_(philosophy) kb_afroasiatic_languages languages , kb_linguistics no longer use the kb_terminology in this kb_word_sense . each of these kb_branches_of_science is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger kb_afroasiatic_languages kb_family_(biology) .in 1969 , kb_harold_c._fleming fleming kb_anatolian_hypothesis that what had previously been known as kb_western_esotericism kb_cushitic_languages is an independent branch of kb_afroasiatic_languages , suggesting for kb_it the kb_new_world kb_toponymy kb_omotic_languages . this proposal and kb_toponymy have kb_methionine with widespread acceptance .several scholars , including kb_harold_c._fleming fleming and kb_robert_hetzron hetzron , have since questioned the traditional inclusion of beja in kb_cushitic_languages .`` kb_glottolog '' does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of kb_omotic_languages has been established , nor that of kb_ongota_language or the unclassified kb_kujarge_language . kb_it therefore splits off the following kb_group_(mathematics) as small kb_family_(biology) : kb_south_omotic_languages , kb_mao_languages , kb_dizoid_languages , kb_gonga–gimojan_languages ( kb_north kb_omotic_languages apart from the preceding ) , kb_ongota_language , kb_kujarge_language .little kb_agreement_(linguistics) exists on the kb_subgrouping_(linguistics) of the five or six kb_branches_of_science of kb_afroasiatic_languages : kb_semitic_languages , kb_egyptian_language , kb_berber_languages , kb_chadic_languages , kb_cushitic_languages , and kb_omotic_languages . however , kb_christopher_ehret ehret ( 1979 ) , kb_harold_c._fleming fleming ( 1981 ) , and kb_joseph_greenberg greenberg ( 1981 ) all agree that the kb_omotic_languages branch split from the rest kb_first_trimester .otherwise :kb_afroasiatic_languages is

kb_grammatical_number divided by the count of kb_grammatical_number in the kb_class_(set_theory) . the kb_class_(set_theory) is often kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of results of an kb_experiment or an kb_observational_study , or frequently kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of results from kb_a kb_survey_(statistics) . the kb_terminology `` kb_arithmetic kb_mean '' is preferred in some contexts in kb_mathematics and kb_statistics because kb_it helps distinguish kb_it from kb_other_(philosophy) means , such as the kb_geometric_mean and the kb_harmonic_mean .in kb_addition to kb_mathematics and kb_statistics , the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is used frequently in many diverse fields such as kb_economics , kb_anthropological_linguistics , and kb_history , and kb_it is used in almost every academic field to some extent . for example , kb_per_capita_income kb_income is the kb_arithmetic average kb_income of kb_a nation 's kb_population .while the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is often used to report kb_central_tendency , kb_it is not kb_a kb_robust_statistic statistic , kb_meaning_(linguistics) that kb_it is greatly influenced by outliers ( values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values ) . notably , for skewed distributions , such as the kb_distribution_of_income of kb_income for which kb_a few kb_people_(american_magazine) 's incomes are substantially greater than most kb_people_(american_magazine) 's , the kb_arithmetic kb_mean may not coincide with kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) 's notion of `` middle '' , and robust kb_statistics , such as the kb_medes , may kb_beryllium kb_a better description of kb_central_europe tendency .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean ( or kb_mean or average ) , formula_1 ( kb_walter_read formula_2 `` bar '' ) , is the kb_mean of the formula_3 values formula_4 .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is the most commonly used and readily understood kb_measure_(mathematics) of kb_central_europe tendency in kb_a kb_data_set . in kb_statistics , the kb_terminology average refers to any of the measures of kb_central_europe tendency . the kb_arithmetic kb_mean of kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of observed kb_big_data is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as kb_being equal to the kb_addition of the numerical values of each and every kb_observation divided by the total kb_grammatical_number of kb_observations_(pierre_belon) . symbolically , if we have kb_a kb_data_set consisting of the values formula_5 , then the kb_arithmetic kb_mean formula_6 is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity by the kb_chemical_formula :( kb_episcopal_see kb_summation for an explanation of the kb_summation_operator ) .for example , let kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of kb_a firm : 2500 , 2700 , 2400 , 2300 , 2550 , 2650 , 2750 , 2450 , 2600 , 2400. the kb_arithmetic kb_mean isif the kb_data_set is kb_a kb_statistical_population ( i.e. , consists of every possible kb_observation and not just kb_a subset of them ) , then the kb_mean of that kb_population is called the kb_population kb_mean . if the kb_data_set is kb_a kb_sampling_(statistics) ( kb_a subset of the kb_population ) , we call the statistic resulting from this kb_calculation kb_a kb_sample_(statistics) kb_mean .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean has several kb_chemical_property that make kb_it useful , especially as kb_a kb_measure_(mathematics) of kb_central_europe tendency . these include :the kb_arithmetic kb_mean may kb_beryllium contrasted with the kb_medes . the kb_medes is kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity such that no more than half the values are larger than , and no more than half are smaller than , the kb_medes . if kb_chemical_element in the kb_big_data kb_arithmetic_progression arithmeticallyif kb_a numerical kb_property , and any kb_sample_(statistics) of kb_big_data from kb_it , could kb_take on any kb_lightness from kb_a kb_continuous_function range , instead of , for example , just integers , then the kb_probability of kb_a kb_grammatical_number falling into some range of possible values can kb_beryllium described by integrating kb_a kb_continuous_probability_distribution distribution across this range , even when the naive kb_probability for kb_a kb_sample_(statistics) kb_grammatical_number taking kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) certain kb_lightness from infinitely many is kb_0_(number) . the kb_analog_device of kb_a kb_weighted_average average in this kb_context_(language_use) , in which there are an kb_infinite_set kb_grammatical_number of possibilities for the precise kb_lightness of the variable in each range , is called the `` kb_mean of the kb_probability_distribution '' . kb_a most widely encountered kb_probability_distribution is called the kb_normal_distribution distribution ; kb_it has the kb_property that all measures of its kb_central_europe tendency , including not just the kb_mean but also the aforementioned kb_medes and the kb_musical_mode ( the kb_triliteral kb_mole_(unit) 's ) , are equal to each kb_other_(philosophy) . this equality does not hold for kb_other_(philosophy) kb_probability distributions , as illustrated for the kb_lognormal_distribution distribution here .kb_particular care must kb_beryllium taken when using cyclic kb_big_data , such as kb_phase_(waves) or angles . naïvely taking the kb_arithmetic kb_mean of 1° and 359° yields kb_a result of

artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range . kb_a kb_solid_solution to this problem is to use the kb_optimization_theory formulation ( kb_viz. , define the kb_mean as the kb_central_europe point : the point about which kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) has the lowest kb_dispersion_(optics) ) , and redefine the difference as kb_a modular kb_distance ( i.e. , the kb_distance on the kb_circle : kb_sulfate the modular kb_distance between 1° and 359° is 2° , not 358° ) .the kb_arithmetic kb_mean is often denoted by kb_a bar , for example as in formula_1 ( kb_walter_read formula_2 `` bar '' ) .some software ( kb_text_processing processors , kb_world_wide_web browsers ) may not kb_computer_monitor the x̄ kb_symbol properly . for example , the x̄

kb_a brutal kb_dictatorship , built upon kb_a kb_cult_of_personality kb_personality and enforced by kb_great_purge of terror . in kb_einstein–szilárd_letter to yvonne davet , orwell described ``

reptiles and kb_other_(philosophy) vertebrates . over kb_time_(magazine) , amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity , leaving only the kb_modern_history subclass kb_lissamphibia .the kb_triliteral kb_modern_history kb_order_(biology) of amphibians are kb_anura_(frog) ( the frogs and toads ) , kb_urodela ( the salamanders ) , and kb_caecilian ( the caecilians ) . the kb_grammatical_number of known kb_amphibian kb_species is approximately 7,000 , of which nearly 90 % are frogs . the smallest kb_amphibian ( and kb_vertebrate ) in the kb_world is kb_a kb_frog from

both reptiles and amphibians is called kb_herpetologykb_the_word_(free_love) word `` kb_amphibian '' is kb_derived_trait from the kb_ancient_greek kb_terminology ἀμφίβιος ( `` amphíbios '' ) , which means `` both kinds of kb_life_(magazine) '' , `` ἀμφί '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` of both kinds '' and `` βιος '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_life_(magazine) '' . the kb_terminology was initially used as kb_a kb_general_(united_states) kb_adjective for kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing that could live on kb_albanian_land_force or in kb_water , including kb_pinniped and otters . traditionally , the kb_class_(biology) amphibia includes all kb_tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes . amphibia in its widest kb_word_sense ( `` kb_sensu_lato '' ) was divided into kb_triliteral kb_class_(biology)the actual kb_grammatical_number of kb_species in each kb_group_(periodic_table) depends on the kb_taxonomy_(general) kb_statistical_classification followed . the kb_2_(number) most

reference database `` kb_amphibian kb_species of the kb_world '' . the kb_grammatical_number of kb_species cited above follows frost and the total kb_grammatical_number of known kb_amphibian kb_species is over 7,000 , of which nearly 90 % are frogs .with the kb_phylogenetics kb_statistical_classification , the taxon kb_labyrinthodontia has been discarded as kb_it is kb_a kb_paraphyly kb_group_(periodic_table) without unique kb_definable_set features apart from kb_cladistics#plesiomorphy kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) characteristics . kb_statistical_classification varies according to the preferred kb_phylogeny of the author and whether they use kb_a kb_cladistics#three_definitions_of_clade or kb_a node-based kb_statistical_classification . traditionally , amphibians as kb_a kb_class_(biology) are kb_dutch_people#ethnic_identity as all tetrapods with kb_a larval stage , while the kb_group_(periodic_table) that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians ( frogs , salamanders and caecilians ) and all their descendants is called kb_lissamphibia . the kb_phylogeny of kb_paleozoic amphibians is kb_uncertainty , and kb_lissamphibia may possibly fall within kb_extinct kb_group_(mathematics) , like the kb_temnospondyli ( traditionally placed in the subclass kb_labyrinthodontia ) or the kb_lepospondyli , and in some analyses even in the amniotes . this

kb_group_(mathematics) that were formerly placed in amphibia in kb_linnaean_taxonomy kb_taxonomy_(biology) , and included them elsewhere under kb_cladistic_taxonomy . if the kb_common_descent kb_ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in amphibia , kb_it becomes kb_a kb_paraphyly kb_group_(periodic_table) .all kb_modern_history amphibians are included in the subclass kb_lissamphibia , which is usually considered kb_a kb_clade , kb_a kb_group_(periodic_table) of kb_species that have kb_evolution_of_tetrapods from kb_a kb_common_descent kb_ancestor . the kb_triliteral kb_modern_history kb_order_(biology) are kb_anura_(frog) ( the frogs and toads ) , kb_caudata ( or kb_urodela , the salamanders ) , and kb_gymnophiona ( or kb_caecilian , the caecilians ) . kb_it has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from kb_a temnospondyl-like kb_ancestor , and even that caecilians are the kb_sister_group kb_group_(periodic_table) of the advanced kb_reptiliomorpha amphibians , and thus of amniotes . although the fossils of several older proto-frogs with kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) characteristics are known , the oldest `` kb_truth kb_frog '' is `` kb_prosalirus_bitis bitis '' , from the kb_early_jurassic kb_jurassic kb_kayenta_formation formation of arizona . kb_it is anatomically very similar to kb_modern_history frogs . the oldest known kb_caecilian is another kb_early_jurassic kb_jurassic kb_species , `` kb_eocaecilia_micropodia micropodia '' , also from arizona . the kb_history_of_abortion#5th_century_to_18th_century kb_salamander is `` kb_beiyanerpeton_jianpingensis jianpingensis '' from the kb_late_jurassic kb_jurassic of kb_northern_mountain_range_(albania) kb_china .authorities disagree as to whether salientia is kb_a kb_superorder that includes the kb_order_(biology) kb_anura_(frog) , or whether kb_anura_(frog) is kb_a sub-order of the kb_order_(biology) salientia . the kb_lissamphibia are traditionally divided into kb_triliteral kb_order_(biology) , but an kb_extinct salamander-like kb_family_(biology) , the kb_albanerpetontidae , is now considered part of kb_lissamphibia alongside the kb_superorder salientia . furthermore , salientia includes all kb_triliteral recent kb_order_(biology) plus the kb_triassic proto-frog , `` kb_triadobatrachus '' .the kb_first_trimester kb_major_(united_states) kb_group_(mathematics) of amphibians kb_adaptation in the kb_devonian period , around 370 million years ago , from kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish which were similar to the kb_modern_history kb_coelacanth and kb_lungfish . these kb_ancient_history kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish had kb_evolution_of_tetrapods multi-jointed leg-like kb_fish_fin with digits that enabled them to crawl along the kb_sea_(astronomy) bottom . some kb_fish had kb_adaptation kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) kb_artificial_lung to help them breathe kb_air_(classical_element) when the stagnant pools of the kb_devonian swamps were low in kb_oxygen . they could also use their kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_fish_fin to hoist themselves out of the kb_water and onto dry kb_albanian_land_force if circumstances kb_sulfate required . eventually , their bony kb_fish_fin would kb_evolution into kb_limb_(anatomy) and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods , including kb_modern_history amphibians , reptiles , kb_birds , and mammals . despite kb_being able to crawl on kb_albanian_land_force , many of these kb_prehistory kb_tetrapodomorph kb_fish still spent most of their kb_time_(magazine) in the kb_water . they had started to develop kb_artificial_lung , but still breathed predominantly with gills .many examples of kb_species showing kb_transitional_fossil features have been discovered . `` kb_ichthyostega '' was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the kb_first_trimester kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) amphibians , with nostrils and more efficient kb_artificial_lung . kb_it had four sturdy kb_limb_(anatomy) , kb_a kb_neck , kb_a kb_tail with kb_fish_fin and kb_a skull very similar to that of the kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish , `` kb_eusthenopteron '' . amphibians kb_evolution_of_tetrapods adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the kb_water for longer periods . their kb_artificial_lung improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger , better able to support the weight of their bodies on kb_albanian_land_force . they kb_adaptation `` hands '' and `` kb_foot '' with five or more digits ; the kb_skin became more capable of retaining kb_human_body fluids and resisting kb_desiccation . the kb_fish 's kb_hyomandibula kb_bone in the kb_hyoid_bone kb_region behind the gills diminished in size and became the kb_stapes of the kb_amphibian kb_ear , an kb_adaptation necessary for kb_hearing_loss on dry kb_albanian_land_force . an affinity between the amphibians and the kb_teleost kb_fish is the multi-folded kb_structure of the kb_tooth and the paired kb_occipital_bone kb_bones_(studio)at the end of the kb_devonian period ( 360 million years ago ) , the seas , kb_list_of_rivers_of_alberta and kb_list_of_lakes_in_alberta were teeming with kb_life_(magazine) while the kb_albanian_land_force was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates , though some , such as `` kb_ichthyostega '' , may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the kb_water . kb_it is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs , dragging their hindquarters in kb_a similar manner to that used by the kb_elephant_seal . in the early kb_carboniferous ( 360 to 345 million years ago ) , the kb_climate_of_albania became wet and warm . extensive swamps kb_adaptation with mosses , ferns , horsetails and kb_calamites . air-breathing arthropods kb_evolution_of_tetrapods and invaded the kb_albanian_land_force where they provided kb_food_industry for the kb_carnivore amphibians that began to kb_ego_psychology to the kb_terrestrial_animal environment . there were no kb_other_(philosophy) tetrapods on the kb_albanian_land_force and the amphibians were at the top of the kb_food_chain , occupying the ecological kb_positional_notation currently held by the kb_crocodile . though equipped with kb_limb_(anatomy) and the ability to breathe kb_air_(classical_element) , most still had kb_a kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) tapering kb_human_body and kb_strong_nuclear_force kb_tail . they were the top kb_albanian_land_force kb_predation , sometimes reaching several metres in kb_length , preying on the kb_prespa_lake insects of the period and the many types of kb_fish in the kb_water . they still needed to return to kb_water to lay their shell-less kb_eggs_as_food , and even most kb_modern_history amphibians have kb_a fully kb_aquatic_plant larval stage with gills like their kb_fish ancestors . kb_it was the development of the kb_amniote egg , which prevents the developing kb_embryo from drying out , that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on kb_albanian_land_force and which kb_light-emitting_diode to their kb_dominance_(ecology) in the period that followed .after the kb_carboniferous_rainforest_collapse collapse kb_amphibian kb_dominance_(ecology) gave way to reptiles , and amphibians were further devastated by the kb_permian–triassic_extinction_event kb_extinction_event . during the kb_triassic ( 250 to 200 million years ago ) , the reptiles continued to out-compete the amphibians , leading to kb_a kb_redox in both the amphibians ' size and their importance in the kb_biosphere . according to the kb_fossil_record , kb_lissamphibia , which includes all kb_modern_history amphibians and is the only surviving lineage , may have branched off from the kb_extinct kb_group_(mathematics) kb_temnospondyli and kb_lepospondyli at some period between the late kb_carboniferous and the early kb_triassic . the relative kb_scarcity of kb_fossil kb_evidence_(law) precludes precise dating , but the most recent kb_molecular_genetics kb_science , based on kb_multilocus_sequence_typing sequence typing , suggests kb_a late carboniferous/early kb_permianthe origins and evolutionary relationships between the kb_triliteral main kb_group_(mathematics) of amphibians is kb_a kb_matter of kb_abortion_debate . kb_a kb_2005_games_of_the_small_states_of_europe kb_molecular_genetics kb_phylogeny , based on kb_ribosomal_dna kb_analysis , suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each kb_other_(philosophy) than they are to frogs . kb_it also appears that the kb_divergence of the kb_triliteral kb_group_(mathematics) took kb_place_of_articulation in the kb_paleozoic or early kb_mesozoic ( around 250 million years ago ) , before the breakup of the kb_supercontinent kb_pangaea and soon after their kb_divergence from the kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish . the briefness of this period , and the swiftness with which kb_radiation took kb_place_of_articulation , would help account for the relative kb_scarcity of kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) kb_amphibian fossils . there are kb_prespa_lake gaps in the kb_fossil_record , but the discovery of kb_a kb_gerobatrachus_hottoni hottoni from the early kb_permian in kb_texas in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 provided kb_a missing link with many of the characteristics of kb_modern_history frogs . kb_molecular_phylogenetics suggests that the frog–salamander kb_divergence took kb_place_of_articulation considerably kb_aristophanes#aristophanes_the_poet than the kb_paleontology kb_evidence_(law) indicates . newer kb_research indicates that the kb_common_descent kb_ancestor of all lissamphibians lived about 315 million years ago , and that kb_stereospondyli are the closest relatives to the caecilians .as they kb_evolution_of_tetrapods from lunged kb_fish , amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on kb_albanian_land_force , including the need to develop kb_new_world means of locomotion . in the kb_water , the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward , but on kb_albanian_land_force , quite different mechanisms were required . their vertebral columns , kb_limb_(anatomy) , kb_lunar_limb girdles and musculature needed to kb_beryllium kb_strong_nuclear_force enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding . kb_terrestrial_animal adults discarded their kb_lateral_line kb_line_(geometry) kb_systems_analysis and adapted their kb_sensory_system kb_systems_analysis to receive kb_stimulus_(psychology) via the kb_list_of_art_mediums of the kb_air_(classical_element) . they needed to develop kb_new_world methods to regulate their kb_human_body kb_heat_(1972_film) to kb_coping_(psychology) with fluctuations in ambient kb_temperature . they kb_adaptation behaviours suitable for kb_biological_reproduction in kb_a kb_terrestrial_animal environment . their kb_seed_coat were exposed to harmful kb_ultraviolet kb_ray_(geometry) that had previously been absorbed by the kb_water . the kb_skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive kb_water loss .the superclass kb_tetrapoda is divided into four classes of kb_vertebrate kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing with four kb_limb_(anatomy) . reptiles , kb_birds and mammals are amniotes , the kb_eggs_as_food of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes , some of which are impervious . lacking these membranes , amphibians require kb_water bodies for kb_biological_reproduction , although some kb_species have kb_adaptation various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable kb_aquatic_plant larval stage . they are not found in the kb_sea_(astronomy) with the exception of kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) or kb_2_(number) frogs that live in kb_brackish_water kb_water in kb_mangrove swamps ; the anderson 's kb_salamander meanwhile occurs in brackish or kb_salt_(chemistry) kb_water kb_list_of_lakes_in_alberta . on kb_albanian_land_force , amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their kb_skin damp

kb_it has an average kb_length of and is part of kb_a kb_genus that contains four of the kb_world 's ten smallest kb_frog kb_species . the kb_largest_organisms living kb_amphibian is the

kb_frog ( `` conraua goliath '' ) , which can reach and weigh .amphibians are ectothermic ( cold-blooded ) vertebrates that do not maintain their kb_human_body kb_temperature through internal kb_physiology processes . their kb_metabolic_rate is low and as kb_a result , their kb_food_industry and kb_energy_industry kb_requirement_analysis are limited . in the adult kb_state_of_matter , they

kb_triliteral kb_bicameralism , kb_2_(number) kb_atrium_(heart) and kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) kb_ventricle_(heart) . they have kb_a kb_urinary_bladder kb_bladder and kb_metabolic_waste#nitrogen_wastes waste products are excreted primarily as kb_urea . most amphibians lay their kb_eggs_as_food in kb_water and have kb_aquatic_plant kb_larvae that undergo kb_metamorphosis to become kb_terrestrial_animal adults . amphibians breathe by means of kb_a pump action in which kb_air_(classical_element) is kb_first_trimester kb_drawing_(metalworking) into the kb_buccopharyngeal_membrane kb_region through the nostrils . these are then closed and the kb_air_(classical_element) is forced into the kb_artificial_lung by kb_contraction_(grammar) of the throat .

range in size from the kb_goliath_frog kb_frog ( `` conraua goliath '' ) of kb_west_africa to the `` kb_paedophryne_amauensis amauensis '' , kb_first_trimester described in kb_papua_new_guinea kb_new_guinea in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2012 , which is also the smallest known kb_vertebrate . although most kb_species are associated with kb_water and damp habitats , some are specialised to live in kb_trees or in deserts . they are found worldwide except for kb_polar_molecule areas .kb_anura_(frog) is divided into kb_triliteral suborders that are broadly kb_acceptance#self_acceptance by the kb_scientific_community , but the relationships between some kb_family_(biology) remain unclear . future kb_molecular_genetics studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships . the suborder kb_archaeobatrachia contains four kb_family_(biology) of kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) frogs . these are kb_ascaphidae , kb_bombinatoridae , kb_discoglossidae and kb_leiopelmatidae which have few kb_derived_trait features and are probably kb_paraphyly with regard to kb_other_(philosophy) kb_frog kb_lineage_(anthropology) . the six kb_family_(biology) in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder kb_mesobatrachia are the kb_fossorial kb_megophryidae , kb_pelobatidae , kb_pelodytidae , kb_scaphiopodidae and kb_rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily kb_aquatic_plant kb_pipidae . these have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the kb_2_(number) kb_other_(philosophy) suborders . kb_neobatrachiathe kb_order_(biology) kb_caudata ( from the kb_latin `` cauda '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_tail '' ) consists of the salamanders—elongated , low-slung kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing that mostly resemble kb_lizards in kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . this is kb_a kb_symplesiomorphy kb_trait_theory and they are no more closely related to kb_lizards than they are to mammals . salamanders lack claws , have scale-free kb_seed_coat , either smooth or covered with tubercles , and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned . they range in size from the kb_chinese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias davidianus '' ) , which has been reported to grow to kb_a kb_length of , to the diminutive `` kb_thorius_pennatulus pennatulus '' from kb_mexico which seldom exceeds in kb_length . salamanders have kb_a mostly laurasian distribution , kb_being present in much of the kb_holarctic kb_region of the kb_northern_hemisphere . the kb_family_(biology) kb_plethodontidae is also found in kb_central_america and kb_south_america kb_north of the kb_amazon_basin ; kb_south_america was apparently invaded from kb_central_america by about the start of the kb_miocene , 23 million years ago . kb_urodela is kb_a kb_toponymy sometimes used for all the kb_extant_taxon kb_species of salamanders . members of several kb_salamander kb_family_(biology) have become kb_neotenythe suborder kb_cryptobranchoidea contains the kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) salamanders . kb_a kb_grammatical_number of kb_fossil cryptobranchids have been found , but there are only kb_triliteral living kb_species , the kb_chinese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias davidianus '' ) , the kb_japanese_giant_salamander kb_salamander ( `` kb_andrias japonicus '' ) and the kb_hellbender ( `` cryptobranchus alleganiensis '' ) from kb_north_america . these kb_prespa_lake amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult kb_state_of_matter ; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded . kb_a unique kb_i_shot_andy_warhol is their ability to kb_animal_feed by suction , depressing either the kb_left-wing_politics side of their lower kb_jaw or the kb_right-wing_politics . the males excavate nests , persuade females to lay their egg kb_string_section inside them , and guard them . as kb_water_well as breathing with kb_artificial_lung , they respire through the many

in this kb_group_(periodic_table) is kb_plethodontidae , the lungless salamanders , which includes 60 % of all kb_salamander kb_species . the kb_family_(biology) kb_salamandridae includes the kb_truth

lack the cloacal glands used by kb_male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecaethe kb_order_(biology) kb_gymnophiona ( from the kb_ancient_greek `` gymnos '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` naked '' and `` ophis '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` serpent '' ) or kb_caecilian ( from the kb_latin `` an- '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` without '' and the kb_ancient_greek `` poda '' kb_meaning_(linguistics) `` kb_human_leg '' ) comprises the caecilians . these are kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , cylindrical , limbless kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing with kb_a snake- or kb_annelid kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism . the adults vary in kb_length from kb_group_8_element to 75 centimetres ( 3 to 30 inches ) with the exception of kb_thomas_thomson_(chemist) 's kb_caecilian ( `` caecilia thompsoni '' ) , which can reach . kb_a kb_caecilian 's kb_skin has kb_a kb_prespa_lake kb_grammatical_number of kb_transverse_wave kb_fold_(geology) and in some kb_species contains tiny kb_embedded_system dermal kb_fish_scale . kb_it has rudimentary eyes covered in kb_skin , which are probably limited to discerning differences in kb_light intensity . kb_it also has kb_a pair of short tentacles near the kb_human_eye that can kb_beryllium extended and which have kb_somatosensory_system and kb_olfaction functions . most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp kb_soil , in rotten kb_wood and under kb_plant debris , but some are kb_aquatic_plant . most kb_species lay their kb_eggs_as_food underground and when the kb_larvae hatch , they make their way to adjacent bodies of kb_water . others brood their kb_eggs_as_food and the kb_larvae undergo kb_metamorphosis before the kb_eggs_as_food hatch . kb_a few kb_species give birth to live kb_thomas_young_(scientist) , nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the kb_oviduct . caecilians have kb_a mostly gondwanan kb_structure contains some typical characteristics common to kb_terrestrial_animal vertebrates , such as the presence of highly kb_keratin#cornification outer layers , renewed periodically through kb_a moulting process controlled by the kb_pituitary_gland and kb_thyroid glands . local thickenings ( often called warts ) are common , such as those found on toads . the outside of the kb_skin is shed periodically mostly in kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) piece , in kb_contrast_(vision) to mammals and kb_birds where kb_it is shed in kb_lithic_flake . amphibians often kb_eat_(film) the sloughed kb_skin . caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal kb_fish_scale kb_embedded_system in the kb_dermis between the furrows in the kb_skin . the similarity of these to the kb_fish_scale of kb_bony_fish kb_fish is largely superficial . kb_lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony kb_deposit_(geology) in the kb_dermis , but this is an example of kb_convergent_evolutionkb_amphibian kb_skin is permeable to kb_water . kb_gas_exchange can kb_take kb_place_of_articulation through the kb_skin ( kb_cutaneous_respiration respiration ) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the kb_surface_(topology) of kb_water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds . to compensate for their thin and delicate kb_skin , amphibians have kb_evolution_of_tetrapods mucous glands , principally on their heads , backs and tails . the secretions produced by these help keep the kb_skin moist . in kb_addition , most kb_species of kb_amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or kb_poisonous substances . some kb_amphibian toxins can kb_beryllium lethal to humans while others have little effect . the main poison-producing glands , the kb_parotoid_gland , produce the kb_neurotoxin kb_bufotoxin and are located behind the kb_ears of toads , along the backs of frogs , behind the eyes of salamanders and on the kb_upper_egypt kb_surface_(topology) of caecilians .the kb_skin colour of amphibians is produced by kb_triliteral layers of kb_pigment kb_cell_(biology) called chromatophores . these kb_triliteral kb_cell_(biology) layers consist of the melanophores ( occupying the deepest layer ) , the guanophores ( forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules , producing kb_a blue-green colour ) and the lipophores ( yellow , the most superficial layer ) . the colour change displayed by many kb_species is initiated by hormones secreted by the kb_pituitary_gland kb_gland . unlike kb_bony_fish kb_fish , there is no direct control of the kb_pigment kb_cell_(biology) by the kb_nervous_system system , and this results in the colour change taking kb_place_of_articulation more slowly than happens in kb_fish . kb_a vividly coloured kb_skin usually indicates that the kb_species is kb_toxicity and is kb_a warning kb_sign_(mathematics) to kb_predation .amphibians have kb_a kb_skeleton system that is structurally kb_homology_(chemistry) to kb_other_(philosophy) tetrapods , though with kb_a kb_grammatical_number of variations . they all have four kb_limb_(anatomy) except for the legless caecilians and kb_a few kb_species of kb_salamander with kb_redox or no kb_limb_(anatomy) . the kb_bones_(studio) are hollow and lightweight . the musculoskeletal system is kb_strong_nuclear_force to enable kb_it to support the kb_human_head and kb_human_body . the kb_bones_(studio) are fully kb_ossification and the vertebrae kb_interlock with each kb_other_(philosophy) by means of overlapping processes . the kb_pectoral_girdle girdle is kb_catalyst_support by kb_muscle , and the well-developed kb_pelvic_girdle girdle is attached to the backbone by kb_a pair of sacral ribs . the kb_ilium_(bone)in most amphibians , there are four digits on the fore kb_hiking and five on the hind kb_hiking , but no claws on either . some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in kb_appearance_(philosophy) with tiny , stubby kb_human_leg . the kb_siren_(genus) are kb_aquatic_plant salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind kb_limb_(anatomy) . the caecilians are limbless . they kb_burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of kb_muscle kb_contraction_(grammar) moving along the kb_human_body . on the kb_surface_(topology) of the ground or in kb_water they move by undulating their kb_human_body from side to side .in frogs , the hind kb_human_leg are larger than the fore kb_human_leg , especially kb_sulfate in those kb_species that principally move by jumping or swimming . in the walkers and runners the hind kb_limb_(anatomy) are not kb_sulfate kb_prespa_lake , and the burrowers mostly have short kb_limb_(anatomy) and broad bodies . the kb_foot have adaptations for the way of kb_life_(magazine) , with webbing between the toes for swimming , broad kb_adhesive toe pads for climbing , and keratinised tubercles on the hind kb_foot for digging ( frogs usually dig backwards into the kb_soil ) . in most salamanders , the kb_limb_(anatomy) are short and more or less the same kb_length and kb_project at kb_right-wing_politics angles from the kb_human_body . locomotion on kb_albanian_land_force is by kb_walking and the kb_tail often swings from side to side or is used as kb_a prop , particularly when climbing . in their normal gait , only kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) leg is advanced at kb_a kb_time_(magazine) in the manner kb_adoption_in_ancient_rome by their ancestors , the kb_sarcopterygii kb_fish . some salamanders in the kb_genus `` kb_aneides '' and certain kb_lungless_salamander climb kb_trees and have kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) kb_limb_(anatomy) , kb_prespa_lake toepads and prehensile tails . in kb_aquatic_plant salamanders and in kb_frog tadpoles , the kb_tail has kb_dorsum_(anatomy) and kb_ventral_fin kb_fish_fin and is moved from side to side as kb_a means of kb_#propulsion . adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones .salamanders use their tails in kb_arms_industry and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in kb_a process known as kb_autotomyamphibians have kb_a juvenile stage and an adult stage , and the circulatory kb_systems_analysis of the kb_2_(number) are distinct . in the juvenile ( or kb_tadpole ) stage , the circulation is similar to that of kb_a kb_fish ; the two-chambered kb_heart pumps the blood through the gills where kb_it is oxygenated , and is kb_spread_(rational_trigonometry) around the kb_human_body and back to the kb_heart in kb_a kb_single_bond loop . in the adult stage , amphibians ( especially frogs ) lose their gills and develop kb_artificial_lung . they have kb_a kb_heart that consists of kb_a kb_single_bond kb_ventricle_(heart) and kb_2_(number) kb_atrium_(heart) . when the kb_ventricle_(heart) starts contracting , deoxygenated blood is pumped through the kb_pulmonary_artery artery to the kb_artificial_lung . continued kb_contraction_(grammar) then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the kb_human_body . mixing of the kb_2_(number) bloodstreams is minimized by the kb_comparative_anatomy of the kb_bicameralism .the kb_nervous_system system is basically the same as in kb_other_(philosophy) vertebrates , with kb_a kb_central_europe kb_brain , kb_a kb_spinal_cord cord , and nerves throughout the kb_human_body . the kb_amphibian kb_brain is less kb_water_well kb_adaptation than that of reptiles , kb_birds and mammals but is similar in kb_morphology_(linguistics) and kb_function_(biology) to that of kb_a kb_fish . kb_it is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving kb_pain_in_amphibians . the kb_brain consists of equal parts , kb_cerebrum , kb_midbrain and kb_cerebellum . various parts of the kb_cerebrum process kb_sensory_system input , such as smell in the kb_olfactory_bulb and sight in the optic lobe , and kb_it is additionally the centre of behaviour and kb_learning . the kb_cerebellum is the center of muscular kb_motor_coordination and the kb_medulla_oblongata controls some kb_organ_(music) functions including heartbeat and respiration . the kb_brain sends signals through the kb_spinal_cord cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the kb_human_body . the kb_pineal_body kb_human_body , known to regulate kb_sleep_(1963_film) patterns in humans , is thought to produce the hormones involved in kb_hibernation and kb_aestivation in amphibians .tadpoles retain the kb_lateral_line_system system of their ancestral fishes , but this is kb_lost_film in kb_terrestrial_animal adult amphibians . some caecilians possess kb_electroreception that allow them to locate kb_object_relations_theory around them when submerged in kb_water . the kb_ears are kb_water_well kb_adaptation in frogs . there is no kb_external_fertilization kb_ear , but the kb_prespa_lake circular kb_tympanum_(anatomy) lies on the kb_surface_(topology) of the kb_human_head just behind the kb_human_eye . this vibrates and kb_sound is transmitted through kb_a kb_single_bond kb_bone , the kb_stapes , to the kb_inner_ear kb_ear . only high-frequency sounds like kb_mating calls are heard in this way , but low-frequency noises can kb_beryllium kb_discovery_of_the_chemical_elements through another kb_mechanism_(biology) . there is kb_a patch of specialized haircells , called `` papilla amphibiorum '' , in the kb_inner_ear kb_ear capable of detecting deeper sounds . another kb_i_shot_andy_warhol , unique to frogs and salamanders , is the columella-operculum kb_complex_number adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the kb_transmission_coefficient of both airborne and seismic signals . the kb_ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly kb_adaptation than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each kb_other_(philosophy) through the kb_list_of_art_mediums of kb_sound .the eyes of tadpoles lack lids , but at kb_metamorphosis , the kb_cornea becomes more dome-shaped , the kb_lens_(anatomy) becomes flatter , and eyelidsmany amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with kb_a sticky tip and drawing kb_it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws . some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey , repeatedly kb_thrust_fault their kb_human_head forward sharply causing the kb_food_industry to move backwards in their mouth by kb_inertia . most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing kb_sulfate they possess voluminous stomachs . the short kb_esophagus is lined with kb_cilium that help to move the kb_food_industry to the kb_stomach and kb_mucus produced by glands in the mouth and kb_pharynx eases its passage . the kb_enzyme kb_chitinase produced in the kb_stomach helps kb_digest_(roman_law) the chitinous kb_cuticle of kb_arthropod prey .amphibians possess kb_a kb_pancreas , kb_liver and kb_gall_bladder kb_bladder . the kb_liver is usually kb_prespa_lake with kb_2_(number) lobes . its size is determined by its kb_function_(biology) as kb_a kb_glycogen and kb_fat storage kb_units_of_measurement , and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up . kb_adipose_tissue kb_tissue_(biology) is another important means of storing kb_energy_industry and this occurs in the kb_abdomen ( in internal kb_structural_analysis called kb_fat bodies ) , under the kb_skin and , in some salamanders , in the kb_tail .there are kb_2_(number) kb_kidneysthe kb_artificial_lung in amphibians are kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) compared to those of amniotes , possessing few internal kb_alveolar_septum and kb_prespa_lake kb_pulmonary_alveolus , and consequently having kb_a comparatively slow kb_diffusion rate for kb_oxygen entering the blood . ventilation is accomplished by kb_buccal_pumping pumping . most amphibians , however , are able to exchange gases with the kb_water or kb_air_(classical_element) via their kb_skin . to enable sufficient kb_cutaneous_respiration respiration , the kb_surface_(topology) of their highly vascularised kb_skin must remain moist to allow the kb_oxygen to diffuse at kb_a sufficiently kb_high_middle_ages rate . because kb_oxygen kb_concentration in the kb_water increases at both low temperatures and kb_high_middle_ages kb_flow_(psychology) kb_rates_(tax) , kb_aquatic_plant amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on kb_cutaneous_respiration respiration , as in the kb_telmatobius_culeus kb_water kb_frog and the kb_cryptobranchus . in kb_air_(classical_element) , where kb_oxygen is more concentrated , some small kb_species can rely solely on cutaneous kb_gas_exchange , most famously the kb_plethodontidae , which have neither kb_artificial_lung nor gills . many kb_aquatic_plant salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage , with some ( such as the kb_axolotlfor the purpose of kb_biological_reproduction most amphibians require kb_fresh_water kb_water although some lay their kb_eggs_as_food on kb_albanian_land_force and have kb_adaptation various means of keeping them moist . kb_a few ( e.g . `` kb_fejervarya_raja raja '' ) can inhabit kb_brackish_water kb_water , but there are no kb_truth kb_ocean amphibians . there are reports , however , of kb_particular kb_amphibian populations unexpectedly invading kb_ocean waters . such was the case with the kb_black_sea invasion of the kb_natural_number kb_hybrid_(biology) `` kb_pelophylax_esculentus esculentus '' reported in 2010 .several hundred kb_frog kb_species in adaptive radiations ( e.g. , `` kb_eleutherodactylus '' , the kb_pacific_ocean `` kb_platymantis '' , the australo-papuan microhylids , and many kb_other_(philosophy) kb_tropical frogs ) , however , do not need any kb_water for kb_breeding_in_the_wild in the kb_wildlife . they reproduce via direct development , an ecological and evolutionary kb_adaptation that has allowed them to kb_beryllium completely independent from free-standing kb_water . kb_almost_all all of these frogs live in wet kb_tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests and their kb_eggs_as_food hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult , passing through the kb_tadpole stage within the egg . reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the kb_quantity of rainfall , but the seasonal timing .in the tropics , many amphibians kb_breed continuously or at any kb_time_(magazine) of year . in kb_temperate_climate kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey , breeding is mostly seasonal , usually in the kb_castalian_spring , and is triggered by increasing day kb_length , rising temperatures or rainfall . experiments have shown the importance of kb_temperature , but the trigger event , especially in kb_arid kb_geographical_regions_of_turkey , is often kb_a storm . in anurans , males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal kb_greek_chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active .in caecilians , fertilisation is internal , the kb_male extruding an kb_intromittent_organ kb_organ_(music) , the phallodeum , and inserting kb_it into the female kb_cloaca . the paired müllerian glands inside the kb_male kb_cloaca secrete kb_a kb_fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian kb_prostate glands and which may kb_transport and nourish the kb_sperm . fertilisation probably takes kb_place_of_articulation in the kb_oviduct .the majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation . in most of these , the kb_male kb_deposit_(geology) kb_a kb_spermatophore , kb_a small packet of kb_sperm on top of kb_a gelatinous kb_conical_surface , on the kb_substratum either on kb_albanian_land_force or in the kb_water . the female takes up the kb_sperm packet by grasping kb_it with the lips of the kb_cloaca and pushing kb_it into the vent . the spermatozoa move to the kb_spermatheca in the roof of the kb_cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may kb_beryllium many months later . courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the kb_spermatophore vary between kb_species . in some , the kb_spermatophore may kb_beryllium placed directly into the female kb_cloaca while in others , the female may kb_beryllium guided to the kb_spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called kb_amplexus . certain kb_primitive_(phylogenetics) salamanders in the kb_family_(biology) kb_sirenidae , kb_hynobiidae and kb_cryptobranchidae practice kb_external_fertilization fertilisation in kb_a similar manner to frogs , with the female laying the kb_eggs_as_food in kb_water and the kb_male releasing kb_sperm onto the egg kb_mass_(liturgy) .with kb_a few kb_non-linear_writing , frogs use kb_external_fertilization fertilisation . the kb_male grasps the female tightly with kb_histidine forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back kb_human_leg , or in the case of `` kb_epipedobates_tricolor tricolor '' , around the kb_neck . they remain in kb_amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the kb_eggs_as_food and the kb_male kb_cover_version them with kb_sperm . roughened nuptial pads on the kb_male 's hands kb_aid in retaining grip . often the kb_male collects and retains the egg kb_mass_(liturgy) , forming kb_a sort of basket with the hind kb_foot . an exception is the kb_granular_poison_frog kb_poison kb_frog ( `` oophaga granulifera '' ) where the kb_male and female kb_place_of_articulation their cloacae in close kb_principles_of_grouping while facing in kb_phyllotaxis directions and then release kb_eggs_as_food and kb_sperm simultaneously . the kb_tailed_frog kb_frog ( `` ascaphus truei '' ) exhibits internal fertilisation . the `` kb_tail '' is only possessed by the kb_male and is an kb_extension_(kinesiology) of the kb_cloaca and used to inseminate the female . this kb_frog lives in fast-flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the kb_sperm from kb_being washed away before fertilisation occurs . the kb_sperm may kb_beryllium retained in storage tubes attached to the kb_oviductthere is kb_a direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts , with elaborate courtship displays to keep the female 's attention kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) enough to get her interested in choosing him to kb_mating with . some kb_species store kb_sperm through kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) breeding seasons , as the kb_extra_(australian_tv_channel) kb_time_(magazine) may allow for kb_interaction_(statistics) with rival kb_sperm .most amphibians kb_go_(game) through kb_metamorphosis , kb_a process of significant kb_morphology_(linguistics) change after birth . in typical kb_amphibian development , kb_eggs_as_food are laid in kb_water and kb_larvae are adapted to an kb_aquatic_plant kb_lifestyle_(sociology) . frogs , toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as kb_larvae with kb_external_fertilization gills . kb_metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by kb_thyroxine kb_concentration in the blood , which stimulates kb_metamorphosis , and kb_prolactin , which counteracts kb_thyroxine 's effect . specific events are dependent on kb_threshold_potential values for different kb_tissue_(biology) . because most kb_embryogenesis is outside the parental kb_human_body , kb_it is kb_grammatical_subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances . for this kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of kb_tooth , whisker-like kb_skin extensions or kb_fish_fin . they also make use of kb_a kb_sensory_system kb_lateral_line kb_line_(geometry) kb_organ_(music) similar to that of kb_fish . after kb_metamorphosis , these kb_organ_(anatomy) become redundant and kb_will_and_testament kb_beryllium reabsorbed by controlled kb_cell_(biology) kb_death , called kb_apoptosisthe egg of an kb_amphibian is typically surrounded by kb_a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides . this capsule is permeable to kb_water and gases , and swells considerably as kb_it absorbs kb_water . the ovum is at kb_first_trimester rigidly held , but in fertilised kb_eggs_as_food the innermost layer liquefies and allows the kb_embryo to move freely . this also happens in kb_salamander kb_eggs_as_food , even when they are unfertilised . kb_eggs_as_food of some salamanders and frogs contain kb_unicellular_organism kb_green_algae . these penetrate the jelly kb_envelope_(waves) after the kb_eggs_as_food are laid and may increase the supply of kb_oxygen to the kb_embryo through kb_photosynthesis . they seem to both speed up the development of the kb_larvae and reduce mortality . most kb_eggs_as_food contain the kb_pigment kb_melanin which raises their kb_temperature through the absorption of kb_light and also protects them against kb_ultraviolet_radiation . caecilians , some kb_plethodontidae and certain frogs lay kb_eggs_as_food underground that are unpigmented . in the kb_wood_frog ( `` rana sylvatica '' ) , the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to kb_beryllium up to warmer than its surroundings , which is an advantage in its cool kb_northern_hemisphere kb_habitat .the kb_eggs_as_food may kb_beryllium

kb_water and hatch into free-living kb_larvae that complete their development in kb_water and later transform into either kb_aquatic_plant or kb_terrestrial_animal adults . in many kb_species of kb_frog and in most lungless salamanders ( kb_plethodontidae ) , direct development takes kb_place_of_articulation , the kb_larvae growing within the kb_eggs_as_food and emerging as miniature adults . many caecilians and some kb_other_(philosophy) amphibians lay their kb_eggs_as_food on kb_albanian_land_force , and the newly hatched kb_larvae wriggle or are transported to kb_water bodies . some

kb_other_(philosophy) amphibians , but not caecilians , are kb_ovoviviparous . the kb_eggs_as_food are retained in or on the parent 's kb_human_body , but the kb_larvae subsist on the yolks of their kb_eggs_as_food and receive no nourishment from the adult . the kb_larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth , either before or after kb_metamorphosis , according to their kb_species . the toad kb_genus `` nectophrynoides '' exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or kb_sulfate members .kb_frog kb_larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) , kb_vertical_direction flattened tails with kb_fish_fin . the free-living kb_larvae are normally fully kb_aquatic_plant , but the tadpoles of some kb_species ( such as `` kb_nannophrys_ceylonensis ceylonensis '' ) are semi-terrestrial and live among wet kb_rock_(geology) . tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons , gills for respiration (

kb_neoteny occurs when the kb_animal 's growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low kb_water temperatures that may change the response of the kb_tissue_(biology) to

.kb_alaska 's kb_economy_of_alaska depends heavily on increasingly expensive kb_diesel_engine kb_fuel for heating , kb_transportation , electric kb_power_(physics) and kb_light . although kb_wind and kb_hydroelectricity kb_power_(physics) are abundant and underdeveloped , proposals for statewide kb_energy_industry kb_systems_analysis ( e.g . with special kb_single-wire_earth_return#use_in_interties electric interties ) were judged uneconomical ( at the kb_time_(magazine) of the report , 2001 ) due to low ( less than 50¢/gal ) kb_fuel prices , kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) distances and low kb_population . the cost of kb_a gallon of kb_gas in kb_urban_area kb_alaska today is usually 30–60¢ higher than the national average ; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on kb_transportation costs , seasonal usage peaks , nearby kb_petroleum development kb_infrastructure and many kb_other_(philosophy) factors .the kb_alaska_permanent_fund fund is kb_a constitutionally authorized appropriation of kb_palm_oil revenues , established by voters in kb_1976_winter_olympics to manage kb_a surplus in kb_state_of_matter kb_petroleum revenues from kb_palm_oil , largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed kb_trans-alaska_pipeline_system pipeline system . the fund was originally kb_anatolian_hypothesis by kb_governor_(united_states) kb_keith_harvey_miller miller on the kb_eve of the 1969 prudhoe bay lease sale , out of kb_fear that the kb_alabama_legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale ( which amounted to kb_usd 900 million ) at once . kb_it was later championed by kb_governor_(united_states) kb_jay_hammond hammond and kb_kenai,_alaska kb_alaska_house_of_representatives hugh malone . kb_it has served as an attractive kb_politics prospect ever since , diverting revenues which would normally kb_beryllium deposited into the kb_general_(united_states) fund .the kb_alaska_constitution was written kb_sulfate as to discourage dedicating kb_state_of_matter funds for kb_a kb_particular purpose . the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this , mostly due to the kb_politics kb_climate_of_albania of distrust existing during the kb_time_(magazine) of its creation . from its initial principal of kb_usd 734,000 , the fund has grown to kb_usd 50 kb_billion as kb_a result of kb_palm_oil royalties and kb_list_of_australian_capital_cities investment programs . most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside kb_alaska . this has kb_light-emitting_diode to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within kb_alaska , though such kb_a stance has never gained kb_momentum .starting in kb_1982_world_rally_championship_season , dividends from the fund 's kb_annual_plant growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans , ranging from an initial kb_usd 1,000 in kb_1982_world_rally_championship_season ( equal to kb_triliteral years ' payout , as the distribution of payments was held up in kb_a lawsuit over the distribution scheme ) to kb_usd 3,269 in kb_u.s._presidential_election,_2008 ( which included kb_a one-time kb_usd 1,200 `` resource rebate '' ) . every year , the kb_state_of_matter kb_alabama_legislature takes out kb_group_8_element % from the earnings , puts 3 % back into the principal for kb_inflation proofing , and the remaining 5 % is distributed to all qualifying alaskans . to qualify for the permanent fund kb_dividend , kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) must have lived in the kb_state_of_matter for kb_a kb_minimum of 12 months , maintain constant residency kb_grammatical_subject to allowable absences , and not kb_beryllium kb_grammatical_subject to kb_court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying kb_biological_classification or may kb_grammatical_subject the payment amount to civil garnishment .the permanent fund is often considered to kb_beryllium kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the leading examples of kb_a `` kb_basic_income '' policy in the kb_world .the cost of

the short 100-day kb_growing_season kb_season limits the crops that can kb_beryllium grown , but the kb_long_island_(antigua_and_barbuda) sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons . the

, small farms and farmers ' kb_market_(economics) in recent years , with the highest percentage increase ( 46 % ) in kb_the_nation nation in growth in farmers ' kb_market_(economics) in 2011 , compared to 17 % nationwide . the kb_peony kb_industry has also taken off , as the kb_growing_season kb_season allows farmers to kb_harvest during kb_a gap in supply elsewhere in the kb_world , thereby filling kb_a niche in the kb_flower market .kb_alaska , with no kb_county_(united_states) , lacks county fairs . however , kb_a small assortment of kb_state_of_matter and local fairs ( with the kb_alaska_state_fair fair in kb_palmer,_alaska the kb_largest_organisms ) , are held mostly in the late summer . the fairs are mostly located in communities with kb_historic_site or kb_electric_current kb_agriculture activity , and kb_i_shot_andy_warhol local farmers exhibiting produce in kb_addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as kb_carnival rides , concerts and kb_food_industry . `` kb_alaska grown '' is used as an kb_agriculture slogan .kb_alaska has an kb_abundance_of_the_chemical_elements of kb_seafood , with the kb_primary_education fisheries in the kb_bering_sea kb_sea_(astronomy) and the kb_north kb_pacific_ocean . kb_seafood is kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the few kb_food_industry items that is often cheaper within the kb_state_of_matter than outside kb_it . many alaskans kb_take advantage of kb_salmon seasons to kb_harvest portions of their kb_household kb_diet_(nutrition) while kb_fishing for subsistence , as kb_water_well as kb_sport . this includes kb_fish taken by hook , net or kb_wheel .hunting for subsistence , primarily kb_caribou , kb_moose , and kb_dall_sheep kb_sheep is still common in the kb_state_of_matter , particularly in remote kb_the_bush_(alaska) communities . an example of kb_a traditional native kb_food_industry is kb_akutaq , the eskimo kb_ice_cream , which can consist of reindeer kb_fat , kb_seal_(emblem) kb_palm_oil , dried kb_fish kb_meat and local berries .kb_alaska 's reindeer herding is concentrated on kb_seward_peninsula , where kb_wildlife kb_caribou can kb_beryllium prevented

with spurs to kb_whittier,_alaska , kb_palmer,_alaska and kb_north_pole . the cities , towns , villages , and kb_region served by arr tracks are known statewide as `` the railbelt '' . in recent years , the ever-improving kb_road_surface highway system began to kb_eclipse the railroad 's importance in kb_alaska 's kb_economy_of_alaska .the railroad played kb_a vital role in kb_alaska 's development , moving kb_cargo into kb_alaska while transporting kb_natural_resources southward ( i.e. , kb_coal from the usibelli kb_coal mine near kb_healy,_alaska to kb_seward,_alaska and kb_gravel from the kb_matanuska_valley kb_valley to kb_anchorage,_alaska ) . kb_it is kb_water_well known for its summertime tour passenger service .the kb_alaska_railroad was kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the last railroads in kb_north_america to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some kb_gravel trains . kb_it continues to offer kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of the last kb_request_stop routes in the kb_country_music . kb_a stretch of about of track along an kb_area kb_north of kb_talkeetna,_alaska remains inaccessible by road ; the railroad provides the only kb_transportation to rural homes and cabins in the kb_area . until kb_construction of the parks highway in the 1970s , the railroad provided the only kb_albanian_land_force access to most of the kb_region along its entire route .in kb_northern_hemisphere kb_southeast_alaska , the kb_white_pass_and_yukon_route and kb_yukon route also partly runs through the kb_state_of_matter from kb_skagway,_alaska northwards into kb_canada ( kb_british_columbia and kb_yukon ) , crossing the kb_border_crossings_of_albania at kb_white_american pass summit . this kb_line_(geometry) is now mainly used by tourists , often arriving

kb_kodiak_island_borough,_alaskathe bulk of remaining commercial kb_flight offerings come from small kb_regional_power commuter airlines such as kb_ravn_alaska kb_alaska , kb_penair , and kb_frontier_flying_service service . the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered kb_the_bush_(alaska) flying kb_service_(economics) using kb_general_aviation kb_aircraft such as the kb_cessna_caravan caravan , the most popular kb_aircraft in use in the kb_state_of_matter . much of this service can kb_beryllium attributed to the kb_alaska bypass kb_airmail kb_program_(computing) which subsidizes bulk kb_airmail kb_childbirth to alaskan rural communities . the kb_program_(computing) requires 70 % of that kb_subsidy to kb_goto_(command) carriers kb_world_health_organization offer passenger service to the communities .many communities have small kb_air_(classical_element) taxi kb_service_(economics) . these operations originated from the demand for customized kb_transport to remote areas . perhaps the most quintessentially alaskan kb_plane_(geometry) is kb_the_bush_(alaska) kb_the_bush_(alaska) kb_seaplane . the kb_world 's busiest kb_seaplane kb_base_(chemistry) is kb_lake_hood_seaplane_base , located kb_next to kb_ted_stevens_anchorage_international_airport stevens kb_anchorage,_alaska international kb_airport , where flights

kb_technology permits innovations like kb_conservation_tillagesince the kb_1940s , kb_agricultural_productivity has increased dramatically , due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive kb_mechanized_farming , kb_fertilizers and kb_pesticides . the vast majority of this kb_energy_industry input comes from kb_fossil_fuel sources . between the kb_1960s_in_the_united_states and the 1980s , the kb_green_revolution transformed kb_agriculture around kb_the_globe_(toronto_newspaper) globe , with kb_world kb_cereal production increasing significantly ( between 70 % and 390 % for kb_wheat and 60 % to 150 % for kb_rice , depending on geographic kb_area ) as kb_world_population doubled . heavy reliance on kb_petrochemicals has raised concerns that kb_palm_oil shortages could increase costs and reduce kb_agriculture output .industrialized kb_agriculture depends on kb_fossil fuels in kb_2_(number) fundamental ways : direct consumption on the kb_farm and manufacture of inputs used on the kb_farm . direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate kb_farm vehicles and kb_machinery .indirect consumption includes the manufacture of kb_fertilizers , kb_pesticides , and kb_farm kb_machinery . in kb_particular , the production of kb_nitrogen_fertilizer can account for over half of kb_agriculture kb_energy_industry usage . together , direct and indirect consumption by kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) farms accounts for about kb_alkaline_earth_metal % of kb_the_nation nation 's kb_energy_industry use . direct and indirect kb_energy_industry consumption by kb_usa_davis_cup_team farms peaked in 1979 , and has since gradually declined . kb_food_systems encompass not just kb_agriculture but off-farm kb_fish_processing , packaging , transporting , marketing , consumption , and disposal of kb_food_industry and food-related items . kb_agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of kb_food_industry system kb_energy_industry use in the kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) .kb_agriculture kb_economics refers to kb_economics as kb_it relates to the `` production , distribution and consumption of [ kb_agriculture ] goods and kb_service_(economics) '' . combining kb_agricultural_sector with kb_general_(united_states) kb_theories of marketing and kb_business as kb_a discipline of kb_science began in the late 1800s , and grew significantly through the 20th century . although the kb_science of kb_agriculture kb_economics is relatively recent , kb_major_(united_states) trends in kb_agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout kb_history , ranging from tenant farmers and kb_sharecropping in the post-american kb_american_civil_war kb_war kb_southern_united_states kb_sovereign_state to the kb_european_eel kb_feudal system of kb_manorialism . in the united kb_sovereign_state , and elsewhere , kb_food_industry costs attributed to kb_food_processing , distribution , and kb_agricultural_marketing , sometimes referred to as the kb_agricultural_value_chain , have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined . this is related to the greater kb_efficiency of farming , combined with the increased level of kb_value_added ( e.g . more highly processed products ) provided by the supply chain . kb_market_concentration kb_concentration has increased in the sector as kb_water_well , and although the total effect of the increased kb_market_concentration kb_concentration is likely increased kb_efficiency , the changes

kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of kb_taxation , kb_subsidy , tariffs and kb_other_(philosophy) measures . since at least the kb_1960s_in_the_united_states , kb_a combination of kb_trade restrictions , kb_exchange_rate_policy rate policies and kb_subsidy have affected farmers in both the developing and the kb_developed_world . in the 1980s , non-subsidized farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low kb_globalization prices for kb_farm products . between the mid-1980s and the early kb_2000s_in_angola , several international agreements limited kb_agriculture tariffs , kb_subsidy and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_trade restrictions .however , , there was still kb_a significant amount of policy-driven kb_distortion in kb_globalization kb_agriculture kb_decay_product prices . the kb_triliteral kb_agriculture products with the greatest amount of kb_trade kb_distortion were kb_sugar , kb_milk and kb_rice , mainly due to kb_taxation . among the oilseedskb_agricultural_science is kb_a broad multidisciplinary field of kb_biology that encompasses the parts of exact , kb_natural_number ,

adverse kb_environmental_awareness effects such as kb_soil_retrogression_and_degradation , kb_waste_management kb_management , and kb_bioremediation .the kb_scientific_method kb_science of kb_agriculture began in the kb_18th_century century , when kb_johann_friedrich_mayer_(agriculturist) friedrich mayer conducted experiments on the use of kb_gypsum ( hydrated kb_calcium_sulphate ) as kb_a kb_fertilizer . kb_research became more kb_iupac_nomenclature when in 1843 , kb_john_lawes and kb_henry_gilbert gilbert began kb_a kb_set_(mythology) of long-term kb_agronomy field experiments at

kb_hatch_act_of_1887 act of 1887 provided funding for what kb_it was the kb_first_trimester to call `` kb_agricultural_science '' , driven by farmers ' kb_interest in kb_fertilizers . in kb_agriculture kb_entomology , the kb_united_states_department_of_agriculture began to kb_research kb_biology control in 1881 ; kb_it instituted its kb_first_trimester kb_prespa_lake kb_program_(computing) in 1905 , searching kb_europe and kb_japan for kb_natural_number enemies of the kb_lymantria_dispar_dispar and kb_brown-tail kb_moth , establishing parasitoids ( such as solitary wasps ) and kb_predation of both pests in the usa .kb_agricultural_policy is the kb_set_(mythology) of kb_forms_of_government decisions and kb_orthopraxy relating to domestic kb_agriculture and imports of foreign kb_agriculture products . governments usually implement kb_agriculture policies with the goal of achieving kb_a specific outcome in the domestic kb_agriculture kb_decay_product kb_market_(economics) . some overarching themes include kb_risk kb_management and adjustment ( including policies related to kb_climate_change , kb_food_safety and kb_natural_number disasters ) , kb_economic_stability ( including policies related to taxes ) , kb_natural_resources and environmental kb_sustainability ( especially kb_water_resource_management ) , kb_research_and_development development , and market access for domestic commodities ( including kb_foreign_relations_of_albania with kb_globalization organizations and agreements with kb_other_(philosophy) countries ) . kb_agricultural_policy can also touch on kb_food_quality , ensuring that the kb_food_industry supply is of kb_a kb_consistent and known quality , kb_food_security , ensuring that the kb_food_industry supply meets the kb_population 's needs , and kb_conservation_biology . policy programs can range from financial programs , such as kb_subsidy , to encouraging producers to enroll in kb_pledge_of_allegiance_(united_states)#legal_challenges quality assurance programs .there are many influences on the creation of kb_agricultural_policy , including consumers , kb_agribusiness , kb_trade lobbies and kb_other_(philosophy) kb_group_(mathematics) . kb_agribusiness interests hold kb_a kb_prespa_lake amount of influence over policy making , in the

'' in kb_histidine kb_letter_(alphabet) to orwell , kb_he_(letter) predicted :kb_thomas_henry_huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the kb_developed_world might make for itself . from these , kb_he_(letter) made some warnings in kb_histidine writings and talks . in kb_a 1958 televised kb_interview_(magazine) conducted by journalist kb_mike_wallace wallace , kb_thomas_henry_huxley outlined several kb_major_(united_states) concerns : the difficulties and dangers of kb_world overpopulation ; the tendency toward distinctly kb_hierarchical kb_social_anarchism organisation ; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of kb_technology in kb_mass_(liturgy) kb_society susceptible to persuasion ; the tendency to promote kb_modern_history politicians to kb_a naive kb_state_school as well-marketed commodities .in 1953 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley and maria kb_applied_science for kb_citizenship_in_the_united_states kb_sovereign_state citizenship and presented themselves for kb_hypothesis . when kb_thomas_henry_huxley refused to kb_bear arms for the kb_usa_davis_cup_team and would not kb_state_of_matter that kb_histidine objections were based on kb_religion ideals , the only excuse allowed under the kb_mccarran_internal_security_act act , the judge had to adjourn the proceedings . kb_he_(letter) withdrew kb_histidine kb_application_(computing) . nevertheless , kb_he_(letter) remained in the kb_usa_davis_cup_team in 1959 kb_thomas_henry_huxley turned down an offer of kb_a kb_knight_bachelor kb_bachelor's_degree by the kb_harold_macmillan#prime_minister_(1957–1963) kb_forms_of_government without putting forward kb_a kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving ; kb_histidine brother kb_julian_(emperor) had been kb_kbe in 1958 , while another brother andrew would kb_beryllium kb_kbe in 1974 .beginning in 1939 and continuing until kb_death_of_alexander_the_great in 1963 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley had an extensive kb_continental_association with the kb_vedanta_society_of_southern_california of kb_southern_europe kb_california , founded and headed by kb_swami_prabhavananda . together with kb_gerald_heard heard , kb_christopher_isherwood isherwood and kb_other_(philosophy) followers , kb_he_(letter) was initiated by the kb_swami and was taught kb_meditation and kb_spirituality practices .in 1944 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley wrote the introduction to the `` kb_bhagavad_gita gita : the song of kb_god '' , translated by kb_swami_prabhavananda and kb_christopher_isherwood isherwood , which was published by the kb_vedanta_society_of_southern_california of kb_southern_europe kb_california .from 1941 until kb_u.s._presidential_election,_1960 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley contributed 48 kb_article_(grammar) to `` kb_vedanta and the kb_western_culture '' , published by the society . kb_he_(letter) also served on the editorial board with isherwood , heard , and kb_playwright kb_john_van_druten druten from kb_1951_in_literature through 1962 .kb_thomas_henry_huxley also occasionally lectured at the kb_hollywood and santa kb_barbara_branden kb_vedanta kb_egyptian_temple . kb_2_(number) of those lectures have been released on cd : `` kb_knowledge_and_understanding understanding '' and `` kb_world_health_organization are we ? '' from 1955. nonetheless , kb_thomas_henry_huxley 's agnosticism , together with kb_histidine speculative propensity , made kb_it difficult for him to fully embrace any kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of institutionalised kb_religion .in the kb_castalian_spring of 1953 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley had kb_histidine kb_first_trimester experience with the kb_psychedelic_drug drug kb_mescaline . kb_thomas_henry_huxley had initiated kb_a correspondence with kb_physician kb_humphry_osmond osmond , kb_a kb_kingdom_of_great_britain kb_psychiatrist then employed in kb_a kb_canadians institution , and eventually asked him to supply kb_a dose of kb_mescaline ; osmond obliged and kb_supervised_learning kb_thomas_henry_huxley 's session in kb_southern_europe kb_california . after the publication of `` kb_the_doors_of_perception of kb_machine_perception '' , in which kb_he_(letter) recounted this experience , kb_thomas_henry_huxley and kb_swami_prabhavananda disagreed about the kb_meaning_(linguistics) and importance of the kb_psychedelic_drug drug experience , which may have caused the relationship to cool , but kb_thomas_henry_huxley continued to write kb_article_(grammar) for the society 's kb_academic_journal , lecture at the kb_temple_of_antoninus_and_faustina , and attend kb_social_anarchism functions . kb_thomas_henry_huxley later had an kb_the_doors_of_perception#later_experience on kb_lysergic_acid_diethylamide that kb_he_(letter) considered more profound than those detailed in kb_the_doors_of_perception of kb_machine_perception .kb_thomas_henry_huxley wrote that `` '' the kb_religious_experience is doubly valuable ; kb_it is valuable because kb_it gives the experiencer kb_a better understanding of himself and the kb_world and because kb_it may help him to kb_lead kb_a less self-centered and more kb_creativity kb_life_(magazine) . '' ''differing accounts exist about the details of the quality of kb_thomas_henry_huxley 's kb_eyesight at specific points in kb_histidine kb_life_(magazine) . in about 1939 kb_thomas_henry_huxley encountered the kb_bates_method for better kb_eyesight , and kb_a teacher , kb_margaret_darst_corbett darst corbett , kb_world_health_organization was able to teach the method to him . in 1940 , kb_thomas_henry_huxley kb_baltimore_colts_relocation_to_indianapolis from kb_hollywood to kb_a `` ranchito '' in the kb_high_middle_ages kb_desert kb_hamlet of llano , kb_california , in kb_northern_hemisphere los angeles county . kb_thomas_henry_huxley then said that kb_histidine sight improved dramatically with the kb_bates_method and the extreme and pure kb_natural_number lighting of the southwestern kb_episcopal_church_(united_states) kb_desert . kb_he_(letter) reported that , for the kb_first_trimester kb_time_(magazine) in more than 25 years , kb_he_(letter) was able to kb_walter_read without glasses and without kb_strain_(biology) . kb_he_(letter) even tried driving kb_a kb_car along the dirt road beside the kb_ranch . kb_he_(letter) wrote kb_a book about kb_histidine successes with the kb_bates_method , `` kb_the_art_of_seeing kb_art of seeing '' , which was published in 1942 ( kb_usa_davis_cup_team ) , 1943 ( kb_united_kingdom ) . the book contained some generally disputed kb_theories , and its publication created kb_a growing kb_degree_(angle) of popular kb_origins_of_the_american_civil_war about kb_thomas_henry_huxley 's kb_eyesight .kb_it was , and is , widely believed that kb_thomas_henry_huxley was nearly kb_blindness since the illness in kb_histidine teens , despite the kb_partial_order recovery that had enabled him to kb_science at kb_oxford . for example , some ten years after publication of `` kb_the_art_of_seeing kb_art of seeing '' , in 1952 , kb_bennett_cerf cerf was present when kb_thomas_henry_huxley spoke at kb_a kb_hollywood banquet , wearing no glasses and apparently kb_reading_abbey kb_histidine paper from the lectern without difficulty : `` then suddenly kb_he_(letter) faltered—and the disturbing kb_truth became obvious . kb_he_(letter) was n't kb_reading_abbey kb_histidine address at all . kb_he_(letter) had learned kb_it by kb_heart . to refresh kb_histidine kb_memory kb_he_(letter) brought the paper closer and closer to kb_histidine eyes . when kb_it was only an kb_inch or kb_sulfate away kb_he_(letter) still could n't kb_walter_read kb_it , and had to kb_fish for kb_a magnifying kb_glass in kb_histidine pocket to make the typing visible to him . kb_it was an agonising moment .

kb_algae have become heterotrophs ( also called colorless or apochlorotic kb_algae ) , sometimes kb_parasitic , relying entirely on kb_external_fertilization kb_energy_industry sources and have

in kb_australian_english . the kb_etymology is obscure . although some speculate that kb_it is related to kb_latin `` algēre '' , `` kb_beryllium cold '' , no kb_#deduction,_reasoning,_problem_solving is known to associate kb_seaweed with kb_temperature . kb_a more likely source is `` alliga '' , `` binding , entwining '' .the kb_ancient_greek word for kb_seaweed was φῦκος ( `` phŷcos '' ) , which could kb_mean either the kb_seaweed ( probably kb_red_fox kb_algae ) or kb_a kb_red_fox kb_dye kb_derived_trait from kb_it . the kb_latinisation_of_names , `` fūcus '' , meant primarily the

based on kb_plastidkb_carl_linnaeus , in `` kb_species_plantarum '' ( 1753 ) , the starting point for kb_modern_history kb_botanical_nomenclature nomenclature , recognized 14 kb_genus of kb_algae , of which only four are currently considered among kb_algae . in `` kb_10th_edition_of_systema_naturae naturae '' , kb_carl_linnaeus described the kb_genus `` kb_volvox '' and `` kb_corallina '' , and kb_a kb_species of `` kb_acetabularia '' ( as `` kb_madrepora '' ) , among the kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing .in 1768 , kb_samuel_gottlieb_gmelin gmelin ( 1744–1774 ) published the `` historia fucorum '' , the kb_first_trimester kb_cold_working dedicated to kb_ocean kb_algae and the kb_first_trimester book on kb_marine_biology to use the then kb_new_world binomial nomenclature of kb_carl_linnaeus . kb_it included elaborate illustrations of kb_seaweed and kb_ocean kb_algae on folded kb_leaf .kb_w.h.harvey ( 1811–1866 ) and kb_lamouroux ( 1813 ) were the kb_first_trimester to divide kb_macroscopic_scale kb_algae into four kb_division_(sport) based on their pigmentation . this is the kb_first_trimester use of kb_a biochemical criterion in kb_plant systematics . harvey 's four kb_division_(sport) are : kb_red_fox kb_algae ( rhodospermae ) , kb_robert_brown_(scottish_botanist_from_montrose) kb_algae ( melanospermae ) , kb_green_algae ( chlorospermae ) , and diatomaceae .at this kb_time_(magazine) , kb_microscopic_scale kb_algae were discovered and reported by kb_a different kb_group_(periodic_table) of workers ( e.g. , kb_otto_friedrich_müller f. müller and kb_christian_gottfried_ehrenberg ) studying the kb_infusoria ( kb_microscopic_scale organisms ) . unlike kb_macroalgae , which were clearly viewed as plants , kb_microalgae were frequently considered kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing because they are often kb_motility . even the nonmotile ( coccoid ) kb_microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the kb_biological_life_cycle of plants , kb_macroalgae , or kb_animal#food_and_energy_sourcing .although used as kb_a kb_taxonomy_(general) category in some pre-darwinian kb_biological_classification , e.g. , kb_carl_linnaeus ( 1753 ) , kb_:de:wolfgang_heilemann jussieu ( 1789 ) , horaninow ( 1843 ) , agassiz ( 1859 ) , wilson & cassin ( 1864 ) , in further kb_biological_classification , the `` kb_algae '' are seen as an artificial , kb_polyphyletic kb_group_(periodic_table) .throughout the 20th century , most kb_biological_classification treated the following kb_group_(mathematics) as kb_division_(sport) or classes of kb_algae : cyanophytes , rhodophytes , chrysophytes , xanthophytes , kb_diatom , phaeophytes , kb_dinoflagellate#history ( kb_cryptomonad and dinophytes ) , euglenophytes , and kb_chlorophyta . later , many kb_new_world kb_group_(mathematics) were discovered ( e.g. , kb_bolidophyceae ) , and others were splintered from older kb_group_(mathematics) : charophytes and glaucophytes ( from kb_chlorophyta ) , many heterokontophytes ( e.g. , kb_synurophyceae from chrysophytes , or eustigmatophytes from xanthophytes ) , haptophytes ( from chrysophytes ) , and chlorarachniophytes ( from xanthophytes ) .with the abandonment of plant-animal dichotomous kb_statistical_classification , most kb_group_(mathematics) of kb_algae ( sometimes all ) were included in protista , later also abandoned in favour of kb_eukaryota . however , as kb_a legacy of the older kb_plant kb_life_(magazine) scheme , some kb_group_(mathematics) that were also treated as protozoans in the kb_past still have duplicated kb_biological_classification ( kb_episcopal_see ambiregnal protists ) .some kb_parasitic kb_algae ( e.g. , the kb_green_algae `` kb_prototheca '' and `` kb_helicosporidium '' , kb_parasites of metazoans , or `` kb_cephaleuros '' , kb_parasites of plants ) were originally classified as kb_fungi , sporozoans , or protistans of `` kb_incertae_sedis sedis '' , while others ( e.g. , the kb_green_algae `` kb_phyllosiphon '' and `` kb_rhodochytrium '' , kb_parasites of plants , or the kb_red_fox kb_algae `` kb_pterocladiophila '' and `` kb_gelidiocolax_mammillatus mammillatus '' , kb_parasites of kb_other_(philosophy) kb_red_fox kb_algae , or the dinoflagellates `` kb_oodinium '' , kb_parasites of kb_fish ) had their relationship with kb_algae conjectured early . in kb_other_(philosophy) kb_noun_case , some kb_group_(mathematics) were originally characterized as kb_parasitic kb_algae ( e.g. , `` kb_chlorochytrium '' ) , but later were seen as kb_endophytic kb_algae . some filamentous kb_bacteria ( e.g. , `` kb_beggiatoa '' ) were originally seen as kb_algae . furthermore , kb_group_(mathematics) like the kb_apicomplexans are also kb_parasites kb_derived_trait from ancestors that possessed plastids , but are not included in any kb_group_(periodic_table) traditionally seen as kb_algae .the kb_first_trimester kb_embryophyte probably

kb_group_(mathematics) to exhibit three-dimensional kb_multicellular kb_thallus are the kb_red_algae and kb_brown_algae , and some kb_chlorophyta . apical growth is constrained to subsets of these kb_group_(mathematics) : the kb_florideophyceae kb_red_algae , various kb_brown_algae , and the charophytes . the kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism of charophytes is quite different from those of kb_red_algae and kb_brown_algae , because they have distinct nodes , separated by internode 'stems ' ; whorls of kb_branches_of_science reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes . conceptacles are another kb_polyphyletic kb_trait_theory ; they appear in the kb_coralline_algae kb_algae and the kb_hildenbrandiales , as kb_water_well as the kb_brown_algae .most of the simpler kb_algae are kb_unicellular_organism flagellates or amoeboids , but kb_colonialism and nonmotile kb_theory_of_forms have kb_adaptation independently among several of the kb_group_(mathematics) . some of the more common organizational levels , more than kb_one_(australian_tv_channel) of which may occur in the kb_biological_life_cycle of kb_a kb_species , arein kb_triliteral lines , even higher levels of organization have been reached , with full kb_tissue_(biology) kb_planetary_differentiation . these are the kb_robert_brown_(scottish_botanist_from_montrose) kb_algae , —some of which may reach 50 kb_mole_(unit) in kb_length ( kelps ) —the kb_red_fox kb_algae , and the kb_green_algae . the most kb_complex_number kb_theory_of_forms are found among the kb_charophyte kb_algae ( kb_episcopal_see kb_charales and kb_charophyta ) , in kb_a lineage that eventually kb_light-emitting_diode to the higher kb_embryophyte . the kb_list_of_azerbaijani_inventions_and_discoveries that defines these nonalgal plants is the presence of female reproductive kb_organ_(anatomy) with protective kb_cell_(biology) layers that protect the kb_zygote and developing kb_embryo . hence , the kb_embryophyte are referred to as the embryophytes .many kb_algae , particularly members of the kb_characeae , have served as kb_rutherford_model experimental organisms to kb_natural_language_understanding the mechanisms of the kb_water permeability of membranes , kb_osmoregulation , kb_turgor_regulation regulation , kb_salt_tolerance , kb_cytoplasmic_streaming streaming , and the generation of

kb_biodegradation the synthetic kb_matter .the kb_natural_number pigments ( carotenoids and chlorophylls ) produced by kb_algae can kb_beryllium used as alternatives to kb_protein_sequencing dyes and coloring agents .the presence of some kb_individual algal pigments , together with specific kb_pigment kb_concentration ratios , are taxon-specific : kb_analysis of their concentrations with various analytical methods , particularly kb_high-performance_liquid_chromatography kb_liquid chromatographycategory : kb_endosymbiotic_theory eventscategory : kb_polyphyletic groupsanalysis of kb_variancekb_analysis of kb_variance ( anova ) is kb_a kb_class_(set_theory) of kb_statistical_mechanics models and their associated estimation procedures ( such as the `` variation '' among and between kb_group_(mathematics) ) used to analyze the differences among kb_group_(periodic_table) means in kb_a kb_sample_(statistics) . anova was kb_adaptation by kb_statistician and kb_evolutionary_biology biologist kb_ronald_fisher fisher . in the anova setting , the observed kb_variance in kb_a kb_particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation . in its simplest kb_hylomorphism#body–soul_hylomorphism , anova provides kb_a kb_statistical_test of whether the kb_population means of several kb_group_(mathematics) are equal , and therefore generalizes the `` t '' -test to more than kb_2_(number) kb_group_(mathematics) . anova is useful for comparing ( testing ) kb_triliteral or more kb_group_(periodic_table) means for kb_statistical_significance . kb_it is conceptually similar to kb_multiple_comparisons_problem t-tests , but is more kb_conservative , resulting in fewer kb_type_i_errors kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics , and is therefore suited to kb_a wide range of practical kb_problems_(aristotle) .while the kb_analysis of kb_variance reached fruition in the 20th century , antecedents extend kb_century_(cricket) into the kb_past according to stigler . these include hypothesis testing , the partitioning of sums of kb_square_(algebra) , experimental techniques and the additive kb_rutherford_model . kb_laplace was performing hypothesis testing in the 1770s . the development of least-squares methods by kb_laplace and kb_carl_friedrich_gauss circa 1800 provided an improved method of combining kb_observations_(pierre_belon) ( over the existing practices then used in kb_astronomy and geodesy ) . kb_it also initiated much kb_science of the contributions to sums of kb_square_(algebra) . kb_laplace knew how to estimate kb_a kb_variance from kb_a residual ( rather than kb_a total ) kb_sum_of_squares_(statistics) kb_square_(algebra) . by 1827 , kb_laplace was using kb_least_squares kb_square_(algebra) methods to address anova kb_problems_(aristotle) regarding measurements of atmospheric tides . before 1800 , astronomers had kb_isolationism kb_observational_astronomy kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics resultingfrom reaction times ( the `` kb_personal_equation '' ) and had kb_adaptation methods of kb_redox the kb_errors_and_residuals_in_statistics . the experimental methods used in the kb_science of the kb_personal_equation were later kb_acceptance#self_acceptance by the emerging field of kb_psychology which kb_adaptation kb_strong_nuclear_force ( full kb_factorial_experiment ) experimental methods to which randomization and kb_blind_experiment were soon added . an eloquent non-mathematical explanation of the additive effects kb_rutherford_model was
